The sidewalk with a yellow tactile paving strip and black metal railings occupies the bottom left and extends into the foreground and middle ground. Street signs and utility poles are positioned in the left and center foreground. The road, marked with orange traffic cones, runs horizontally through the middle ground, with vehicles such as white and red cars moving from left to right across the center and right of the frame. Lush green trees and a partially visible building with a sloped roof form the background, spanning the upper half of the frame, while the blue sky with scattered clouds fills the top background. The camera remains at approximately eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent height relative to the sidewalk and street elements. The spatial framing shifts slightly as the camera moves forward along the sidewalk, causing foreground elements like railings and signs to pass from left to right and briefly obscure the view before revealing more of the intersection and background. As the camera moves, street signs and utility poles transition from the middle ground to the foreground, while a large metal-backed sign appears in the right foreground.",

A fourth, partially visible elephant remains relatively static on the far left edge of the middle ground. Tall, golden-yellow grass fills the foreground and extends into the middle ground across the entire frame. Scattered green trees, bushes, and dark mounds are also visible in the middle ground. As the scene progresses, the three moving elephants maintain their relative formation while shifting left: the adult elephant initially on the right moves towards the center of the frame, the baby elephant moves from the center-right to the center-left, and the adult elephant initially in the center-left progresses towards the left edge of the frame. Throughout the shot, hazy blue-grey hills form the background across the upper portion of the frame, with a pale, hazy sky above them.",
