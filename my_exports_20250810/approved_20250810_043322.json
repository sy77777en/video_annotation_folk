Positioned centrally in the frame, the man occupies the foreground, with his body facing forward. His head is slightly tilted back, and his eyes are closed. A pink substance splatters onto the left side of his face, spreading across his features and dripping down his shirt. This action occurs dynamically, with the substance visibly impacting his face and scattering droplets around him. The background consists of leafy trees, which remain out of focus, placing the man firmly in the foreground. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's eye level throughout the sequence, ensuring the man remains the focal point. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning, keeping the viewer's attention fixed on the man's reaction and the splattering substance.",

The background features a wall made of metal panels at the back of the room, extending to form the right wall, where a wooden crate is positioned in the foreground. On the left side of this background wall, there is a bulkhead door with a small porthole through which a dim beam of light shines. The figure, whose features are obscured by a hood, drops from the chest and moves to the right, going under the bed. As the figure moves beneath the bed, a light source held in its hand illuminates the floor, shifting the focal point of light to the area under the bed frame.",

Initially, it is a medium full shot, with the players visible from the middle of the shin and upwards. Spectators are visible in the background behind a glass barrier. The players then break from their huddle and skate in a loose formation towards the right, moving across the middle ground. As they skate, the camera pans to follow their movement, keeping them relatively centered, and zooms out to create a full shot. They pass a red-framed goal net on the left and continue across the ice. The rink boards and advertisements occupy the background upper part of the frame, while the spectators remain in the background throughout the shot. The camera is positioned above the subjects.",
