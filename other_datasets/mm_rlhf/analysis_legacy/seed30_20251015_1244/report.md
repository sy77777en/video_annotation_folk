## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating whether a critique is CONSTRUCTIVE or NON-CONSTRUCTIVE.

**Definition from first principles:**

A critique is CONSTRUCTIVE if and only if it provides ENOUGH INFORMATION to improve the answer WITHOUT needing to go back to the source material.

**The test (apply this literally):**
Imagine you are an editor who CANNOT see the original source text. You only have:
1. The question
2. The current answer  
3. The critique

Can you make a CONCRETE improvement to the answer using just these three things?

- If YES (you can write a better answer) → CONSTRUCTIVE
- If NO (you need to read the source to know what to write) → NON-CONSTRUCTIVE

**Important: Think creatively about implications**
Some critiques don't explicitly tell you what to do but strongly imply it:
- "Jerry does not leave" → Remove the part about Jerry leaving (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "We don't know the narrator's gender" → Use "they" instead of "he/she" (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "The sentence is unnecessary" but multiple sentences exist → Which sentence? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "Second sentence is irrelevant" → Remove the second sentence (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "First seven chapters are suitable for undergrad, book as a whole for grad students" → Implies chapters 8+ exceed novice (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "Statement cannot be confirmed and spelling is incorrect" → Fix spelling, remove unconfirmed statement (CONSTRUCTIVE)

**Critical distinctions:**
1. If answer is ALREADY GOOD and critique ONLY confirms it (purely positive, no problems mentioned):
   - "Answer correctly and accurately" → CONSTRUCTIVE (confirms it's good, keep as is)
   - "Correct answer" → CONSTRUCTIVE (no changes needed)
   - "Comprehensive analysis" → CONSTRUCTIVE (praise only)
   - "The answer is correct" → CONSTRUCTIVE (affirmation only)

2. If critique mentions ANY problem, even while being positive:
   - "Correct answer, no description" → NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (what description?)
   - "Answer correctly, needs more detail" → NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (what details?)
   - "Good but missing X" without specifying X → NON-CONSTRUCTIVE

3. If critique says something is WRONG but doesn't tell you what's RIGHT:
   - "Everything beyond first sentence is inaccurate" → What IS accurate? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
   - "This cannot be confirmed" → What CAN be confirmed? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
   
4. If critique IMPLIES what's correct through contrast:
   - "First seven for undergrad, whole book for grad" → Clearly implies 8+ are advanced (CONSTRUCTIVE)
   - "Cannot be confirmed + spelling wrong" → Fix spelling + remove unconfirmed part (CONSTRUCTIVE)

**Examples to illustrate the principle:**

Example 1:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Could also mention the organizations she founded."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Which organizations? Need the source)

Example 2:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Should mention she founded UNESCO and WHO."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Specific organizations provided)

Example 3:
Question: "Why did she donate?"
Answer: "She was born in China."
Critique: "She was born in California, not China."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Doesn't help answer WHY she donated; need source for the reason)

Example 4:
Answer: "The narrator is a keen sergeant. He admires the Germans. He is confident he will survive."
Critique: "The second sentence is irrelevant."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove the second sentence)

Example 5:
Answer: "Jerry and Brian are happy, but when Janice dies, Brian cries and Jerry leaves."
Critique: "Jerry does not leave."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove or correct the part about Jerry leaving)

Example 6:
Answer: "The narrator lives in a small house. She wants to leave."
Critique: "We don't know the narrator's gender."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Change "she" to "they")

Example 7:
Answer: "Accurate, detailed description of the setting."
Critique: "The description is accurate."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Confirms answer is good; purely positive, no problems mentioned)

Example 7b:
Answer: "Brief description."
Critique: "Correct answer, no description."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Says "correct" but also says problem: "no description" - what description is needed?)

Example 7c:
Answer: "The puppies are interacting."
Critique: "Answer correctly and accurately."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Purely positive affirmation; action = keep as is)

Example 8:
Question: "What chapters exceed novice level?"
Answer: "The first seven chapters."
Critique: "First seven are for undergrads, whole book for grad students."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Implies chapters 8+ exceed novice)

Example 9:
Answer: "Primoš is in urban area. Has trails and museum."
Critique: "Urban area statement cannot be confirmed. Spelling of Primož is wrong."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Fix spelling, remove unconfirmed statement)

Example 10:
Answer: "Complex narrative with several key points."
Critique: "Everything beyond first sentence is inaccurate."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (What IS accurate then? Need source to know what to write)

**Your task:**
Apply the test literally. Think about what the critique implies. Can you write a better answer using ONLY the question, current answer, and critique?

Format your response as:
Rationale: [Explain whether you can or cannot improve the answer without the source, and why. If you can improve it, briefly state how.]
Classification: [Constructive or Non-Constructive]

#### Good Answer - Non-Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Can you describe the tow vehicle shown in the video?

**Answer**: The tow vehicle in the video is a typical airport aircraft tug or tow tractor. It's designed to move large aircraft by connecting to their front landing gear. This particular tug is positioned directly in front of a large commercial airplane, likely a wide-body jet, and is used for towing or pushing the aircraft on the tarmac. The tow vehicle is low to the ground, often to allow for better maneuverability and to fit under the aircraft's nose.

**Critique**: Describes not only the tractor shown in the video, but also what the tractor does

**Answer Quality**: Good

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer includes information about the function of the tow vehicle, not just its description. However, it does not specify what aspects of the description are incorrect or need to be changed. Without additional information on what the tow vehicle looks like or specific details that should be included, it is not possible to improve the answer based solely on the critique. The critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the description of the tow vehicle without referring back to the source material (the video).

#### Good Answer - Non-Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Provide an exhaustive description of the video content.

**Answer**: The video appears to be a tutorial on how to clean running shoes. Here's a detailed description of the content:

1. **Setting and Materials**: The video starts with a person seated on the floor with various cleaning materials laid out. These include a bottle of detergent, a brush, a container filled with water, and a pair of shoes.

2. **Instructions**: 
   - The person begins by explaining the materials needed for cleaning: a bucket, water, lukewarm water, and a brush. These are visually listed on the screen.
   - An illustration of a washing machine is shown, which is then crossed out, indicating that using a washing machine is not recommended for cleaning the shoes.

3. **Demonstration**:
   - The person demonstrates the process of cleaning the shoes by using the brush and water from the container.
   - The shoes are scrubbed thoroughly, with emphasis on specific areas.
   - The laces are removed and shown, suggesting they might be cleaned separately.

4. **Drying Process**:
   - A radiator is shown in the background, likely suggesting a method for drying the shoes.
   - The person continues to explain or demonstrate the drying process, possibly indicating that shoes should be air-dried.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The video seems to conclude with a message emphasizing the passion for running, shown with the text, "There's a runner in all of us."

Throughout the video, an emphasis is placed on hand-cleaning shoes rather than using a machine, likely to preserve their quality and longevity.

**Critique**: Throughout the video, there is an emphasis on cleaning the shoes by hand rather than using a machine, most likely to preserve the quality and longevity of the shoes.

**Answer Quality**: Good

**Rationale**: The critique provided is essentially a restatement of a point already made in the answer, specifically the emphasis on hand-cleaning shoes rather than using a machine. It does not introduce any new information or suggest any changes to improve the answer. Since the critique does not identify any problems or provide additional details that could enhance the answer, it does not enable a concrete improvement without referring back to the source material.

**Answer**: The main focus of the individual's outfit is the black hat and sunglasses, which add a stylish touch to their overall look.

**Critique**: Incorrect answer, did not mention the sequined mini skirt, description is simple.

**Answer Quality**: Needs Improvement

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific element that was omitted from the answer: the sequined mini skirt.
