## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating whether a critique provides ACTIONABLE feedback for improving an answer.

**Core principle:** A critique is CONSTRUCTIVE if it gives you specific actions to take that will improve the answer. Think: "After reading this critique, do I know what to do next?"

**CONSTRUCTIVE - Examples where you know what action to take:**

1. Factual corrections that help answer the question:
   - "He was caught, though" → Action: Add this fact ✅
   - "Some people are worried due to the virus" → Action: Use this as the answer ✅
   - "It should be 18 or 19, not 17" → Action: Change the number ✅

2. Content to add/remove:
   - "It's omitted that X" → Action: Add X ✅
   - "The second sentence is irrelevant" → Action: Remove second sentence ✅
   - "The last sentence is repetitive" → Action: Remove/revise it ✅

3. Style improvements with clear direction:
   - "Unnecessarily wordy" → Action: Make it more concise ✅
   - "Should be a full sentence" → Action: Rewrite as complete sentence ✅

4. Confirmation when answer is good:
   - "Correct answer" or "Answer correctly" when answer is already good → Action: No changes needed ✅

**NON-CONSTRUCTIVE - Examples where you don't know what action to take:**

1. Corrections that don't help answer the question:
   - Question: "Why did she donate?" Answer: "She was born in China" Critique: "No, she was born in California"
   - Problem: Even with correction, still doesn't answer WHY she donated ❌

2. Vague problems without specifics:
   - "Needs more description" → What description? ❌
   - "Could be more accurate" → What's inaccurate? How to fix? ❌
   - "Left out key information" → What information? ❌
   - "The listing doesn't make sense" → Which part? What's wrong? ❌

3. Contradictory or unclear:
   - "Correct answer, no description" when answer needs improvement → Which is it? What description? ❌
   - "Should be rewritten" without saying how → Rewrite how? ❌

**Decision process:**
1. Read the critique
2. Ask: "Can I improve the answer using ONLY this critique, without re-reading the source?"
3. Ask: "Does this critique help me better answer the QUESTION that was asked?"
4. If YES to both → Constructive
5. If NO to either → Non-Constructive

**Special case:** If the answer is good and critique says "correct" / "no issues" / "accurate" → Constructive (action = keep as is)

Format your response as:
Rationale: [In 2-3 sentences, explain what action the critique suggests (if constructive) or what's missing (if non-constructive)]
Classification: [Constructive or Non-Constructive]

Question:
{question}

Answer:
{answer}

Critique:
