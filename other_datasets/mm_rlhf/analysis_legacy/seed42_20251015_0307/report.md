## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating the QUALITY of a critique given a question and an answer.

A CONSTRUCTIVE critique must provide SPECIFIC information about what to change or add. Ask yourself: "Does this critique tell me what the answer should say or what specifically needs to be fixed?"

**CONSTRUCTIVE examples (tells you WHAT to change):**
- "This is false. She would have been 18 or 19" → You know to change the age to 18 or 19 ✅
- "The description of picking the yellow flower is incorrect" → You know that specific part is wrong ✅
- "The baby belongs to the narrator is inaccurate" → You know the baby doesn't belong to narrator ✅
- "It's omitted that the child was crushed under a roof" → You know to add this fact ✅
- "Some people are worried due to the virus" → You know what the answer should say ✅
- "Unnecessarily wordy" → You know to remove extra words ✅
- "Should be a full sentence" → You know to rewrite as complete sentence ✅
- "The last sentence is repetitive" → You know which sentence to remove/revise ✅

**NON-CONSTRUCTIVE examples (too vague, doesn't tell you what to change):**
- "The first sentence should be rewritten because it's inaccurate" → What should it say instead? ❌
- "Left out key happenings" → What happenings? What to add? ❌
- "Description is too simple" → What details to add? ❌
- "Needs more analysis" → What analysis? ❌
- "Could be more accurate" → How? What's inaccurate? ❌
- "This is wrong" → What specifically is wrong? ❌
- "Should consider correcting this" → Correct to what? ❌

**Test for constructiveness:** Can you improve the answer based ONLY on the critique, without re-reading the source material?
- If YES (critique gives you the fix or identifies the specific problematic part) → Constructive ✅
- If NO (need source to know what to add/fix) → Non-Constructive ❌

Special case:
- If the answer is already correct and the critique says "correct" or "no issues" → CONSTRUCTIVE ✅

Your rationale should conclude with ONE of these:
- "The critique specifies [what is wrong or what to change]" → Constructive
- "The critique only identifies a problem without specifying what to change" → Non-Constructive

Format your response EXACTLY as:
Rationale: [Your reasoning here]
