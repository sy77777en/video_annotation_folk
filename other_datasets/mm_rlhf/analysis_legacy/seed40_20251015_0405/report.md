## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating whether a critique is CONSTRUCTIVE or NON-CONSTRUCTIVE.

**Definition from first principles:**

A critique is CONSTRUCTIVE if and only if it provides ENOUGH INFORMATION to improve the answer WITHOUT needing to go back to the source material.

**The test (apply this literally):**
Imagine you are an editor who CANNOT see the original source text. You only have:
1. The question
2. The current answer  
3. The critique

Can you make a CONCRETE improvement to the answer using just these three things?

- If YES (you can write a better answer) → CONSTRUCTIVE
- If NO (you need to read the source to know what to write) → NON-CONSTRUCTIVE

**Important: Think creatively about implications**
Some critiques don't explicitly tell you what to do but strongly imply it:
- "Jerry does not leave" → Remove the part about Jerry leaving (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "We don't know the narrator's gender" → Use "they" instead of "he/she" (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "The sentence is unnecessary" but multiple sentences exist → Which sentence? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "Second sentence is irrelevant" → Remove the second sentence (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "First seven chapters are suitable for undergrad, book as a whole for grad students" → Implies chapters 8+ exceed novice (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "Statement cannot be confirmed and spelling is incorrect" → Fix spelling, remove unconfirmed statement (CONSTRUCTIVE)

**Critical distinctions:**
1. If answer is ALREADY GOOD and critique just confirms it ("accurate description", "correct answer"):
   → CONSTRUCTIVE (action = keep as is, no changes needed)

2. If critique says something is WRONG but doesn't tell you what's RIGHT:
   - "Everything beyond first sentence is inaccurate" → What IS accurate? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
   - "This cannot be confirmed" → What CAN be confirmed? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
   
3. If critique IMPLIES what's correct through contrast:
   - "First seven for undergrad, whole book for grad" → Clearly implies 8+ are advanced (CONSTRUCTIVE)
   - "Cannot be confirmed + spelling wrong" → Fix spelling + remove unconfirmed part (CONSTRUCTIVE)

**Examples to illustrate the principle:**

Example 1:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Could also mention the organizations she founded."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Which organizations? Need the source)

Example 2:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Should mention she founded UNESCO and WHO."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Specific organizations provided)

Example 3:
Question: "Why did she donate?"
Answer: "She was born in China."
Critique: "She was born in California, not China."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Doesn't help answer WHY she donated; need source for the reason)

Example 4:
Answer: "The narrator is a keen sergeant. He admires the Germans. He is confident he will survive."
Critique: "The second sentence is irrelevant."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove the second sentence)

Example 5:
Answer: "Jerry and Brian are happy, but when Janice dies, Brian cries and Jerry leaves."
Critique: "Jerry does not leave."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove or correct the part about Jerry leaving)

Example 6:
Answer: "The narrator lives in a small house. She wants to leave."
Critique: "We don't know the narrator's gender."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Change "she" to "they")

Example 7:
Answer: "Accurate, detailed description of the setting."
Critique: "The description is accurate."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Confirms answer is good; action = keep as is)

Example 8:
Question: "What chapters exceed novice level?"
Answer: "The first seven chapters."
Critique: "First seven are for undergrads, whole book for grad students."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Implies chapters 8+ exceed novice)

Example 9:
Answer: "Primoš is in urban area. Has trails and museum."
Critique: "Urban area statement cannot be confirmed. Spelling of Primož is wrong."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Fix spelling, remove unconfirmed statement)

Example 10:
Answer: "Complex narrative with several key points."
Critique: "Everything beyond first sentence is inaccurate."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (What IS accurate then? Need source to know what to write)

**Your task:**
Apply the test literally. Think about what the critique implies. Can you write a better answer using ONLY the question, current answer, and critique?

Format your response as:
Rationale: [Explain whether you can or cannot improve the answer without the source, and why. If you can improve it, briefly state how.]
Classification: [Constructive or Non-Constructive]

Question:
{question}

Answer:

The dohyō is about 4.55 meters (approximately 15 feet) in diameter and is raised slightly off the ground. The boundary of the ring is marked by a series of rice-straw bales. The dohyō is considered sacred, and there are rituals performed before the matches to purify it.

**Critique**: The answer is correct and detailed, mentioning that the diameter of the soil surface is about 4.55 meters

**Answer Quality**: Good

**Rationale**: The critique confirms that the answer is correct and detailed, specifically mentioning the diameter of the dohyō. This implies that no changes are needed to improve the answer, as it is already accurate and complete. The action here is to keep the answer as is.

**Critique**: The answer is correct and the description is detailed

**Answer Quality**: Good

**Rationale**: The critique confirms that the current answer is accurate and provides a detailed description. As an editor, I can conclude that no changes are needed to improve the answer. The critique implies that the answer should remain as it is, which is a concrete action (to keep the answer unchanged).

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Good Answer - Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Characterize each scene of the video using a detailed description.

**Answer**: The video shows an aerial view of a cityscape at dusk or dawn, with a prominent mosque in the background. The sky is clear with a few clouds, and the colors suggest either early morning or late evening light. The city is densely packed with buildings, mostly residential, and the rooftops are varied in color and design. The mosque stands out due to its large dome and minarets, which are typical features of Islamic architecture. The overall atmosphere appears calm and serene, with no visible movement or activity from this high vantage point.

**Critique**: The answer is correct, and the description is accurate.

**Answer Quality**: Good

**Rationale**: The critique confirms that the current answer is accurate and provides a detailed description of the scene in the video.

#### Good Answer - Non-Constructive Example 1

**Question**: What items are present on the table in the classroom?

**Answer**: The table in the classroom has a green box, a black wallet, and some cards.

**Critique**: Description of the green box and the cards is correct.

**Answer Quality**: Good

**Rationale**: The critique confirms that the description of the green box and the cards is correct, which implies that the information about the black wallet might be incorrect or unnecessary. However, the critique does not provide any information about what should be done with the black wallet part of the answer. Without additional information, I cannot determine whether the black wallet should be removed, corrected, or left as is. Therefore, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material to verify the presence or absence of the black wallet.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Needs Improvement Answers - Constructive (5 shown)

#### Needs Improvement - Constructive Example 1

**Question**: What is the chimpanzee's behavior towards the yellow object?

**Answer**: The chimpanzee is holding and manipulating the yellow object with its hands, and at times, it dips the object into a puddle of water on the ground.

**Critique**: The description is incorrect, the chimpanzee did not dip the yellow object into the water.

**Answer Quality**: Needs Improvement

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the part of the answer stating the chimpanzee dipped the yellow object into the water is incorrect. This allows for a concrete improvement by removing or correcting that specific part of the answer. The critique does not provide information on what the chimpanzee actually did with the yellow object instead of dipping it into the water, but it does allow for the removal of the incorrect action. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it provides enough information to make a specific change to the answer.

**Classification**: Constructive

This suggests that the critique is confirming the accuracy of the answer as it stands. Therefore, the critique implies that the current answer is correct and does not require any changes. As an editor, I can conclude that the answer should remain as is, based on the critique.

**Classification**: Constructive

**Answer**: Besides the glass and bottle, there is a bowl on the table.

**Critique**: I didn't see any bowls on the table from the video

**Answer Quality**: Needs Improvement

**Rationale**: The critique states that there is no bowl visible on the table according to the video. This implies that the mention of the bowl in the answer is incorrect. Therefore, the answer can be improved by removing the mention of the bowl. The critique provides enough information to make this specific change without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

**Critique**: Wrong answer, the video is not a pitch

**Answer Quality**: Needs Improvement

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is wrong because the video is not a pitch. However, it does not provide any information about what the video actually depicts. Without knowing what the video shows, I cannot improve the answer. I would need to refer back to the source material (the video) to determine the correct phases or actions captured.

#### Needs Improvement - Non-Constructive Example 4

**Question**: What are the ingredients of the hamburger?

**Answer**: The hamburger in the video has lettuce, cheese, and meat as its ingredients.

**Critique**: The response lacks the mention of bread and the description is overly simplistic.

**Answer Quality**: Needs Improvement

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer is missing the mention of bread, which is a specific and actionable piece of information that can be added to improve the answer. Additionally, the critique notes that the description is overly simplistic, which implies that more detail could be added about the ingredients. However, without specific details on what additional information should be included, the critique does not provide enough information to enhance the description beyond adding bread. Therefore, while the critique is partially constructive in terms of adding bread, it is non-constructive regarding how to make the description less simplistic without further details.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive
