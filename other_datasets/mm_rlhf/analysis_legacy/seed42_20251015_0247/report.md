## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating the QUALITY of a critique given a question and an answer.

A CONSTRUCTIVE critique identifies a specific, actionable problem that helps improve the answer. It should point to what needs fixing, even if it doesn't provide the complete solution. Examples include:

**Factual corrections:**
- "This is false. She would have been 18 or 19" ✅
- "The baby belongs to the narrator is inaccurate" ✅
- "There is no evidence it was a daughter, not a son" ✅

**Content improvements:**
- "It's omitted that X" (specifies what's missing) ✅
- "Should mention Y" or "Missing: Z" ✅
- "This doesn't answer the question. Should focus on X" ✅

**Style/structure issues:**
- "The last sentence is repetitive" ✅
- "Unnecessarily wordy" ✅
- "Should be written as a full sentence" ✅
- "This could be phrased differently to tie in better with X" ✅

**Key principle**: If the critique tells you WHAT to fix (even without telling you exactly HOW), it's constructive.

A NON-CONSTRUCTIVE critique is too vague to know what to fix:
- "This is wrong" (doesn't say what specifically) ❌
- "Needs improvement" (doesn't say what or how) ❌
- "Not good enough" (no specifics) ❌
- "There are issues" (doesn't identify them) ❌

Special case:
- If the answer is already correct and no critique is necessary, then an empty critique or one that says "no issues" should be treated as CONSTRUCTIVE/APPROPRIATE.

Please first provide your rationale (2-3 sentences explaining your reasoning), then output your classification.

Format your response as:
Rationale: [Your reasoning here]

## Sample Examples

### Non-Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Non-Constructive Example 1

**Question**: What type of drum pedal setup is being used in the video?

**Answer**: The drummer is using a double bass drum pedal setup.

**Critique**: Only provides the correct answer without analysis

**Rationale**: The critique "Only provides the correct answer without analysis" is non-constructive because it does not specify what is lacking in the answer or what needs to be improved. It vaguely suggests that more analysis is needed but does not identify specific areas where the answer could be enhanced or what kind of analysis is expected. Without these details, it is not actionable.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

---

#### Non-Constructive Example 2

**Question**: What is the atmosphere like at the pool during the competition?

**Answer**: The video shows that there are many people gathered around the pool, watching and cheering on the swimmers as they compete. The atmosphere appears to be lively and energetic, with spectators enjoying the excitement of the race.

**Critique**: Correct answer, but the description is limited.

**Rationale**: The critique acknowledges that the answer is correct but points out that the description is limited. However, it does not specify what aspects of the atmosphere are missing or what additional details could enhance the answer. Without specific guidance on what to expand or improve, the critique lacks actionable feedback.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

---

#### Non-Constructive Example 3

**Question**: What is the setting of the video, and who can be seen in the background?

**Answer**: The setting of the video is a casino, and in the background, there are two men and a woman. One man is wearing a blue shirt and white pants, and he is seated at a green gaming table with cards in his hand. The other man is standing behind him, wearing a white shirt and suspenders. The woman, who has blonde hair, is also seated at the table.

**Critique**: Negative sample with incorrect answer.

**Rationale**: The critique provided is vague and does not specify what is incorrect about the answer. It simply states that the answer is a "negative sample with incorrect answer" without identifying any specific factual inaccuracies, content omissions, or style issues that need to be addressed. Therefore, it does not provide actionable feedback on what to fix in the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

---

#### Non-Constructive Example 4

**Question**: What are some of the gestures that the girl uses in the video?

**Answer**: The girl uses various gestures to emphasize her points, such as pointing at herself or making circular motions with her hands. She also uses her hands to gesture towards objects or people in the background.

**Critique**: Similar to 2

**Rationale**: The critique "Similar to 2" is too vague and does not specify what aspect of the answer needs improvement or correction. It does not identify any specific issue with the answer or provide any actionable feedback that could help improve it. Without knowing what "2" refers to, the critique lacks clarity and specificity, making it non-constructive.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

---

#### Non-Constructive Example 5

**Question**: What do the final frames of the video show?

**Answer**: The final frames of the video show a red vehicle with significant damage to its side, including dents and scratches, and a smashed window.

**Critique**: Correct answer with a brief analysis

**Rationale**: The critique provided does not identify any specific issues or areas for improvement in the answer. It simply states that the answer is correct and offers a brief analysis, which does not point out any actionable problems or suggest any enhancements. Since the critique does not specify what needs fixing, it is non-constructive. However, if the answer is indeed correct and complete, acknowledging it as such would be appropriate.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Constructive Example 1

**Question**: What colors dominate the sails of the windsurfers in the video?

**Answer**: The windsurfers in the video have colorful sails, with yellow being the most prominent color.

**Critique**: Correct answer, no analysis.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is correct and does not require any analysis. This implies that there are no issues with the answer that need addressing, which aligns with the guideline that if the answer is already correct, a critique indicating "no issues" is appropriate.

#### Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Is the bottle of wine opened or unopened?

**Answer**: The bottle of wine is opened.

**Critique**: Correct answer, no analysis

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is correct and does not require any further analysis.

**Classification**: Constructive

---

#### Constructive Example 3

**Question**: What colors dominate the deck area of the yacht?

**Answer**: The deck area of the yacht is dominated by white and beige tones.

**Critique**: There is an error in the description, no white.

**Rationale**: The critique specifically identifies an error in the answer by pointing out that the description of the deck area as having white tones is incorrect. This provides a clear indication of what needs to be fixed in the answer, which is the removal or correction of the mention of white tones. The critique is actionable as it directly addresses a factual inaccuracy.

**Classification**: Constructive

---

#### Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Analyze the video, focusing on its cinematography and narrative structure.

**Answer**: The video depicts a person picking up a yellow flower from the ground. The scene is set in a garden or field with green plants surrounding the area. The person's hands are visible as they carefully pluck the flower from the ground. The camera focuses on the flower and the person's hands, providing a close-up view of the action. The lighting is natural, with sunlight illuminating the scene. The overall mood of the video is peaceful and serene, evoking a sense of nature and tranquility. The narrative structure is simple, with the focus being solely on the act of picking up the flower. There are no other characters or events in the video, allowing the viewer to fully appreciate the beauty of the flower and the natural surroundings. Overall, the video is a beautiful and calming depiction of nature and the simple pleasures it can offer.

**Critique**: Some descriptions are correct, but the description of picking the yellow flower is incorrect.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the answer by pointing out that the description of picking the yellow flower is incorrect. This provides a clear indication of what needs to be addressed in the answer, even though it does not specify what the correct description should be. By highlighting this factual inaccuracy, the critique offers a direction for improvement.

**Classification**: Constructive
