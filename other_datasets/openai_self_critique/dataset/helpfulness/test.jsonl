What if we were made to be the sidekick for other's success stories? I thought this was kind of stupid too, until I began to really think about it and reflect on my life. I began to find similarities between my story and Joey's from Yugioh or Brock from Pokémon; yes, I had my own accomplishments but ultimately, I couldn’t see the direction I needed to go in to complete my story, I just seem to be floating around hopping from story to story helping others on their quest with no clear end game for me.   \n \n\nMy name is Caleb Dudley, I'm a 20-year-old Male living in Florida and this is the story of how I became a sidekick.\n\nI started my life as most American kids do; going to school, making friends and not caring about anything except when P.E was. I went to multiple nice schools, not really fitting in anywhere, I was always the outsider, the expendable kid. Not only was I aggressive to my teachers/school staff, there were very few people I really trusted. Looking back at it now I’d say it was because my father wasn’t there much, and my step dad influenced my mother to create a abusive household- hell on earth in the middle of a suburb. I think the only thing that kept me from truly snapping was my childhood best friend Vikram. I can’t thank him enough for keeping me grounded in some of the hardest times of my life. I can see that he was the first hero I became the sidekick for. He was the brains and I was the brawn, we were unstoppable in anything we did.\n\nIn 4th grade my mother moved us to San Antonio Texas for her work, away from my friends and from my dad I had nothing. This is where I had to develop myself; something snapped in me and I suddenly stopped being aggressive and I stopped crying but I still felt alone. I did find new friends but I knew they only befriended me because I was an outsider and an outsider I would continue to be.\n\n5th grade we moved back to Florida where I attended my old elementary school and was accepted into a International Baccalaureate middle school. This school was supposed to be a government implemented program where they take “gifted” kids from all over the city and put them in a school in the middle of bad neighborhoods. To me things were looking up, we moved back into our old house, I had my friends again and I had my hero again to help me through my shitty living situation. This all came crashing down when I started middle school.\n\nSee because I had to go to this neighborhood for school I spent about 4 hours of my day on a bus with other kids, both in middle school and high school, in my situation. I thought everything was going great; the same kids who knew about my troubled elementary school years were going to the local middle school, so this was a clean slate. My feelings were affirmed when I started school, for reasons unknown I became the class clown and everyone knew me as such. By 8th grade I was on top of the school, I even became close with most of the cliques in the school; being the glue that made our class so close. This, unfortunately, became the only happiness I had in my life at the time. My best friend, being 2 years older than me and having strict parents, was busy making the most of his high school years, destined to do great things as any hero should. \n\nThe 4 hours I spent on the bus everyday became my 2nd hell but was also where I met my 2nd hero. My bus ride was where I was bullied almost every single day, they couldn’t make fun of my clothes because there was a uniform requirement at my school but they made fun of everything else they could, sometimes even resorting to physical violence. To this day I hate thinking about my time on that bus. I was ultimately the damsel in distress, which is where my hero came into play. In 8th grade a new high schooler rode our bus named Valarie, just by talking to her you could tell she was a social outcast, just the person to not give a fuck about others opinions. She became my new hero, someone who would help me through 8th grade and protect me from the kids on the bus while I became her sidekick, someone who would be there to talk to her and make her laugh. \n\nYou probably get the point by now: I remain a social outcast, I get bullied some more, I find a new hero, I move, repeat. You’re probably bored with this post by now and I don’t blame you. This looks like one big sob story to be honest.  I guess the only reason I made this was to warn everyone to not be a sidekick like me. I need help, I need a new hero.

His head hung low against the rain, joints aching and lungs burning from the cold air, he walks on under the gaze of the silent marble guardians that stand all around.  They are placed in concentric ranks, evenly spaced and facing inwards, ever vigilant. There are thousands of them; tens of thousands even, covering an area miles wide. They are spaced evenly throughout their rings with a gap just wide enough for two people to slip in between with twice that distance between each layer. Small engraved platinum plaques rest at the base of each, meticulously produced and maintained. \n\n\nAt the center is an open space dominated by a large sphere which floats reverently above the ground. The Earth in all its glory, with its greens, blues, and browns – meticulously detailed. White clouds swirl and dance in real time in a never ending show that matches reality. If an observer looks closely, they see small ripples throughout the vast blue oceans as the moon engages in its eternal struggle with the tides. Yellow points of civilization dot the night side, ever struggling against the darkness which creeps steadily west. Giant black scars and craters run along its surface, an eternal reminder of events not long passed.  \n\n\nOnce in awhile the old man sees another like himself, walking solemnly through this holiest of places. He places a hand onto the cold stone of a statue to steady himself as a strong gust smashes into his fragile frame. He pulls back his hand as if bitten, a numbness spreading throughout his soul. As he continues forward he looks into the faces around him even as the rain soaks his face. He doesn’t notice as it slips down his coat, and doesn’t care as the cold steals the feeling from his skin. He is beyond knowing discomfort. It has been many months since he felt. \n\n\nEach face is alive with hand crafted detail down to the very pores of the shining stone skin. Their expressions are serious yet hopeful, sad but inspiring. They stand life sized and uniformed, medals and ribbons adorning their chests. Over each stone heart is a small pin with the shape and detail of the Earth. Had they not been made of lifeless stone, each likeness could be mistaken for a living being. They are the holiest relics of the human race, in a place that has become a religious site that has no priests and belongs to no church. They stand at attention in eternal watch over the planet in their midst and the pilgrims who walk through their home.\n\n\nAs the old man draws nearer to his destination he slows his all ready careful pace to the barest of movements. He has entered the space of his nightmares, the place he visits each night in sleep and each day in life. It is a familiar place, one he has navigated through hundreds of times in the few short months since its completion. It has become routine in a sense. His path is always the same; the same stones, the same steps, the same faces, the same emptiness. \n\n\nHe stops at each monument and memorizes every face before reading the plaque under it. Each one is long since engraved in his mind. They are his link to the past, to better times before.  Some of the names he knows from the old letters. They are his most cherished possessions and the only thing of value he has. He falls asleep each night with a stack of them in his bed, only escaping into the embrace of sleep when he is too tired to remain awake any longer. \n\n\nAfter a time that may have been as long as hours or as short as minutes, the old man arrives at what has become both his hell and his salvation. It is a statue of a young woman, so perfectly detailed that the sight of it tears through his soul. He stares at her face and struggles to look away. The plaque at her feet tells only the barest of stories; that she was an officer; that she served all of humanity; that she died protecting her home. That she will be forever remembered. She has a face the old man is intimately familiar with. Her name is the same as his. \n\n\nHe remembers how it all started. How smart and happy and full of life she was. How she glowed and seemed to brighten a room just by being present. How he always pushed her to strive for more, to live up to her full potential. How he had wanted a better life for her than he had ever had for himself. How she had applied on an off chance and been accepted into the program, and how she had gone with his blessing and his encouragement. How she had written every day after she left, and how utterly proud he was. How she was his only child. \n\n\nHe remembers too how it all ended. How the Earth had been decimated. How she had been called up. He watched the live video as it all unfolded, remembers how three billion voices screamed as one when they were victorious. He remembers how none of those thousands of Earth’s children who had left ever came back. He remembers the guilt and the pain so heavy it crushed the air from his lungs. \n\n\nAmidst the howling wind, he trembles violently and falls to his knees. The rain washes the tears from his face as he sobs uncontrollably. The old man curls up at the feet of his life and waits to die. \n","title":"Pilgrim"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarise the theme of death in paragraphs 7 and 8?","answers":[{"answer":"The theme of death is talked about in paragraphs 7 and 8.

Aug. 31, 2016. (C-SPAN)\n\nLet no one speak of Donald Trump pivoting ever, ever again.\n\nThe past couple weeks brought the speculation back: Maybe the bombastic GOP nominee was finally modulating his tone and recognizing he needs to appeal to a wider audience than the anti-immigrant, Breitbart-reading, borderline-bloodthirsty crowds that attend his rallies.\n\nAnd indeed, a more reserved and serious-sounding Trump showed up to meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on Wednesday, further inflating the belief that the reality television star might be pivoting from xenophobic showman to quasi-serious candidate.\n\nBut then Trump flew back to the states for a Wednesday night speech and all hell broke loose. Before a raucous crowd in Arizona, Trump returned to his natural center: angry, snarling, aggrieved and terrifying.\n\n[Trump vows to remove millions living in country illegally: &#039;No amnesty&#039;]\n\nSeeking to end confusion over his recently muddled language, Donald Trump vowed to remove millions living in the country illegally if he becomes president\n\nAfter spending time in Mexico praising the country's \"high quality people,\" Trump, just hours later, launched into a rant about undocumented Mexican immigrants who have killed and raped, spinning a dystopian tale that painted all immigrants as people to be feared, people to be rounded up and hauled out of this country.\n\nHe said immigrants would need an \"ideological certification\" that confirms they \"share our values.\"\n\nHe again approvingly referenced President Dwight D. Eisenhower's deportation program \"Operation Wetback,\" a cruel and deadly disaster from the 1950s, suggesting that Trump's version of that program would be even tougher.\n\nHe claimed there are 2 million \"criminal aliens\" in America and then said, preposterously, \"Day one, my first hour in office – those people are gone!\"\n\nThe crowd ate that nonsense up.\n\nSaying that some think the word \"deport\" is not politically correct, Trump mocked: \"You can call it whatever the hell you want, they're gone.\"\n\nLoud. Spewing insults and absurd claims. Red-faced and nationalistic. It was Trump as we know him to be.\n\nHe took the pivot some were predicting and ripped it to shreds, delivering a speech lavishly praised by white supremacists like David Duke and by wretched far-right opportunists like Ann Coulter.\n\nIt was a hate speech. That will prompt many of Trump's supporters and alt-right fan boys to call me a PC liberal vermin or a \"cuck\" or whatever inane term they've reserved for those who diss their hero. (I'm white, male and not Jewish, so that keeps them from using many of their preferred insults.)\n\n[Fact check: Trump&#039;s speech misstates reality of U.S. immigration policy]\n\nDonald Trump's attempt to clarify his immigration policy instead muddied some of the circumstances for people in the country illegally or for the U.S. economy.\n\nBut there's no reason to parse words when it comes to that bilious speech. It was hate-filled and hateful. You could see the hands of Steve Bannon, who runs the far-right \"news\" site Breitbart and is now CEO of Trump's campaign, all over it, as if Trump was barfing out the comments section under one of the site's white nationalist screeds.\n\nModerate Republicans who have been praying daily for their nominee to grow into a plausible candidate had to be sickened by what they saw Wednesday night.\n\nThat wasn't a speech on immigration policy, as the campaign had promised. That was Donald Trump thumbing his nose at the establishment and at all the pundits who suggested he was \"softening\" his stance on immigration.\n\nThat was an angry man catering to a base that shares his anger, a base that mistakenly believes it constitutes an electoral majority.\n\nTrump's swoop from supposed statesman in Mexico to manic hate-monger in Arizona was jarring. Truly.\n\nAnd it showed anyone who could stand to watch that the idea of a Trump pivot is dead for good.

I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me. Perhaps I couldn’t fix her parent’s divorce, but I could at least attend her house party.

I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately.

That is going to happen. Elections have consequences.”\n\n  \"To be clear, what you described is a quid pro quo\" -- Here's Mick Mulvaney casually admitting that Trump held up aid to Ukraine as leverage to get the Ukrainian government to investigate the 2016 election pic.twitter.com/ylz7BKEmKd\n\n  — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 17, 2019\n\nForeign policy negotiations often demand trading a move by one country with a policy change by the other. President John F. Kennedy resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis with the Soviet Union by agreeing to remove U.S. nuclear missiles from Turkey in exchange for the USSR pulling its nuclear missiles from Cuba.\n\nWhat makes Trump’s exchange different is that the “favor” he asked of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a personal, political benefit. The insertion of personal gain is what makes it corrupt.\n\nMulvaney claimed that the Trump administration was withholding aid from Ukraine to coerce the country into investigating a supposed Democratic National Committee email server and alleged “corruption” in the 2016 election ― not former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump’s top political rivals heading into 2020. (Mulvaney’s claim is incomplete and misleading: Trump brought up both the DNC server and Biden in his call with Ukraine’s president.)\n\nWhen Karl asked why the U.S. stopped the aid, Mulvaney said that Trump thought it was unfair that the European Union wasn’t doing more to help Ukraine.\n\nThen Mulvaney referenced a debunked conspiracy theory that claims the DNC’s physical “server” is missing in a cover-up and that Crowdstrike, a private cybersecurity company hired to investigate Russia’s hack of the DNC’s servers, is framing Russia for election interference.\n\n“Did [Trump] also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that,” Mulvaney told the reporter. “But that’s it, and that’s why we hung up the money.”\n\nAs The Daily Beast reported last year, the DNC’s so-called “server” is actually a system of 140 servers and none of the DNC’s machines are missing.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska denounced efforts to “hold up” foreign aid for political reasons.\n\n“You don’t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative,” Murkowski said in response to questions about Mulvaney’s press conference.\n\n  “You don’t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative,” Murkowski says when asked about Mulvaney comments today\n\n  She also says it’s not appropriate to hold G7 at Trump Doral\n\n  — Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) October 17, 2019\n\nHours after the news conference, Mulvaney walked back his admission that the U.S. withheld Ukranian aid for political gain.\n\nIn a lengthy statement, he said the opposite of his earlier remarks: “There was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukranian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.”\n\nMulvaney also wrongly blamed the media for “misconstruing” and putting a spin on the comments he made during the news conference, which was televised and streamed live to the public. \n\n_Paul Blumenthal contributed reporting._\n\n_This article has been updated with Mulvaney’s later comments denying he had said there was a quid pro quo over political help._\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n-   Mick Mulvaney Walks Back Admission Of Quid Pro Quo In Trump's Ukraine Call\n-   GOP Senator Breaks With White House Over Ukraine Quid Pro Quo\n-   John Bolton Instructed Aide To Warn White House Lawyers About Rudy Giuliani: Reports\n-   White House Adviser Considered EU Ambassador A National Security Risk: Report\n\nCalling all HuffPost superfans!\n\nSign up for membership to become a founding member and help shape HuffPost's next chapter\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about Mulvaney's statements regarding the foreign aid to Ukraine?","answers":[{"answer":"Mulvaney admits that the Trump administration withheld aid from Ukraine to coerce the Ukraine government into investigating a supposed Democratic National Committee email server and alleged \"corruption\" in the 2016 election.

Image courtesy of The Harvard Food Law & Policy Clinic and Racing Horse Productions\nMontana throws more milk down the drain than other states because the sell-by date on the milk is required by state law to be just 12 days after pasteurization (the industry standard is 21 days). After these 12 days, Montana law requires that the milk be thrown away. It can’t be sold or donated. Thousands of gallons of milk are thrown away each week that many believe is perfectly fine to drink.\n\n[]\nMilk past its “sell-by” date is poured down the drain\nIn theory, Montana’s strict date label law is about food safety and protecting the consumer. But it hasn’t been updated since the 80s, and some believe it’s more about protecting the interests of the dairy industry.\n\nDate labels, of course, aren’t just on milk, they’re on a lot of products. Forty-one states require a date label on at least some food product but there are huge inconsistencies, not just in the wording, but in the meaning of these labels. Some states require them only on dairy, some on shellfish, some on any perishable foods.\n\n[]\nMap showing date labels on different types of products. Courtesy of The Dating Game: How Confusing Date Labels Lead to Food Waste in America\nIt’s become complicated to decipher these dates or to know how to act on them, for large retailers and individual consumers alike. And despite what many people assume, they are not about food safety and were actually never meant to be.\n\nIt all began in the 1970s. Americans had moved further away from their food sources and were eating more packaged foods and getting more of their food in supermarkets. Consumers wanted a way to measure how fresh their food was. At the time, most manufacturers already put encrypted dates on their products to help retailers rotate stock and consumers craved access to this information.\n\n[]\n1977 Chicago Tribune article\nIn 1977, the New York State Consumer Protection Board published a booklet called Blind Dates: How to Break the Codes on the Foods You Buy. The booklet told consumers how to decipher the encrypted date codes on their favorite products. The board distributed more than 10,000 copies and posted the booklet in supermarkets.\n\n[]\nImage courtesy of Mark Turnauckas\nEventually, consumers started to demand that these dates be put clearly on packaging, and retailers and grocery stores responded. A few states began to regulate these date labels, but there was no federal-level regulation, even though there were a number of attempts. Still, consumers wanted freshness dates, so all kinds of different ones popped up (“use-by”, “sell-by”, “best-by”, “best if used by,” “expires on”). Some dates were stamped right on the product, some printed on the label. There was no consistency in how this information was displayed or the language that was used.\n\nSome companies even tried to use “freshness dating” to sell their products, like in this Pepsi commercial:\n\nSome date labels were meant for consumers, while others were just meant for retailers. And as is still true now, There were no clear definitions for any of the phrases and no consistency even within the same brand or product. Dates could differ from state-to-state, manufacturer-to-manufacturer, or store-to-store.\n\n[]\nThis product is best if used by July, 1716. Image courtesy of Lynn Friedman\nOver the years we’ve lost track of what these labels meant in the first place. We’ve come to associate the dates with safety, when in fact, they’ve always been about freshness. As much as we might want them to, the dates on our food are not going to tell us if we’ll get salmonella or e-coli.\n\nMost date labels are arrived at by conducting taste tests. Does a product still taste good on day 4? Day 5?\n\nAnd yet today, according to a report that Emily Broad-Leib co-authored, a majority of consumers believe that eating food past it’s sell-by or use-by date is a risk to their health. And as many as 90% of Americans throw out food based on date labels at least occasionally.\n\n[]\nImage courtesy of The Dating Game: How Confusing Date Labels Lead to Food Waste in America\nThe average American wastes somewhere between 20-25% of the food they acquire. The EPA and USDA recently announced a goal to cut food waste in the U.S. in half by 2030, and having a better date labeling system is one way to get there.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Why does more milk go to waste in Montana than anywhere else in the US?","answers":[{"answer":"The sell-by date required by state law is 12 days after pasteurization, whereas the industry standard is 21 days.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer does not mention that the milk cannot be sold or donated after the 12 days.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null},{"question":"Why does Montana have such strict milk laws?","answers":[{"answer":"In theory, it is about food safety and protecting the consumer.

Suwa’s concept is striking in that it conceives of combined terrestrial and aquatic spaces as, effectively, neighborhoods.\n\nIn a reflection on and expansion of his initial article on the topic, Hayward[6] identified that he envisaged the concept as a reflection on the Anthropocene and as:\n\nSubsequent developments of the concept have analysed its applicability to topics such as ocean spaces and national rights of access to these (Fleury[7]), cultural practices in Melanesian coastal societies (Dick[8]) and career making in island communities (Alexander[9]). Writing in the (now defunct) journal _Urban Island Studies_, Hayward[10] expanded on his original analyses by addressing metropolitan locales and providing a characterisation of Manhattan as an aquapelagic city that was subsequently critiqued and modified by Ayasha Guerin.[11] While there have been critics of the concept, such as Baldacchino,[12] who regard the term as unnecessary in that archipelagic analyses can be extended to address aquatic elements, writers from various disciplines have engaged with the concept in a positive manner, such as May Joseph and Sofia Varino’s exploration of the concept with regard to water ecology themed performance works in the journal _Women’s Studies Quarterly_[13] and Barbara Hawkins in her discussion of a geopolitical aesthetic of the subterranean in the journal _Geopolitics_.[14]\n\n\nAssociated Concepts\n\nOne significant development of the concept of the aquapelago has concerned the notion of there being an “aquapelagic imaginary.” This idea was originally floated by Hayward in 2017,[15] and was subsequently elaborated in a theme issue of the journal _Shima_ on mermaids, mer-cultures and the aquapelagic imaginary[16] to refer to the manner in which communities’ “engagements with their aquapelagic locales” in folk-/media-loric contexts can be understood to reflect upon and transcend “perceptions of the limits of human presence in and experience of aquatic spaces.”[17] In an article analysing the creation of a modern mythic entity, the Ningen, a creature rumoured to inhabit the southern Pacific Ocean, Greenland and Hayward[18] discuss the aquapelagic imaginary as a “subset\" of the \"social imaginary”, which can be regarded as a historically determined “enabling but not fully explicable symbolic matrix within which a people imagine and act as world-making collective agents”.[19]\n\n\nFurther reading\n\nA variety of articles on the concept of aquapelago published in the journal _Shima_ and elsewhere are anthologised online at: https://shimajournal.org/anthologies.php\n\n[1] Hayward, Philip (2012), “Aquapelagos and Aquapelagic Assemblages” _Shima_ 6 (1), 1-11.\n\n[2] Publication Details - Shima: The International Journal of Research into Island Cultures [ISSN: 1834-6057]\n\n[3] \n\n[4] There is a degree of irony here in that the term “archipelago” was derived from the Greek arkhi (chief) and pelagos (sea), referring to the Aegean.\n\n[5] Suwa, Jun’ichiro (2012) “Shima and Aquapelagic Assemblages” _Shima_ 6 (1), 12-16.\n\n[6] Hayward, Philip (2012), “The constitution of assemblages and the aquapelagality of Haida Gwaii” _Shima_ 6 (2), 1-14\n\n[7] Fleury, Christian (2013) “The Island/Sea/Territory Relationship” _Shima_ 7 (1), 1-13.\n\n[8] Dick, Thomas (2015) “Chorographing the Vanuatu Aquapelago”, _Shima_ 9 (1), 1-22.\n\n[9] Alexander, Rosie (2015) “Career Decision Making in Island Communities”, _Shima_ 9 (1), 38-52\n\n[10] Hayward, Philip (2015) “The Aquapelago and the Estuarine City: Reflections on Manhattan” _Urban Island Studies_ 1, 81-95.\n\n[11] Guerin, Ayasha (2019) “Underground and at Sea: Oysters and Black Marine Entanglements in New York’s Zone A” _Shima_ 13 (2), 30-55.\n\n[12] Baldacchino, Godfrey (2012) “Getting Wet: A response to Hayward’s concept of Aquapelagos”, _Shima_ 6 (2), 22-26.\n\n[13] Joseph, May and Sofia Varino (2017) “Aquapelagic Assemblages: Performing Water Ecology with Harmattan Theatre” _Women’s Studies Quarterly_ 45 (1-2) 151-166.\n\n[14] Hawkins, Barbara (2018) “A Volcanic Incident’: Towards a geopolitical aesthetics of the subterranean” _Geopolitics_ 24 (3), 1-26.\n\n[15] Hayward, Philip (2017) _Making a Splash: Representations of Mermaids (and Mermen) in 20th and 21st Century Audiovisual Media_, Eastleigh: John Libbey and Co. pp 6-7.\n\n[16] _Shima_ 12 (2), https://shimajournal.org/issues.php\n\n[17] Hayward, Philip (2018) “Introduction: Mermaids, Mercultures and the Aquapelagic Imaginary”, _Shima_ 12 (2), 1-2.\n\n[18] Greenland, Felicity and Hayward, Philip (2020) “Ningen: The context and generation of media-lore concerning a giant, sub-Antarctic, aquatic humanoid” _Shima_ 14 (1), 33-40.\n\n[19] Gaonkar, D.P (2002) ‘Towards New Imaginaries’, _Popular Culture_ 14 (1), 1.\n","title":"Aquapelago"},"questions":[{"question":"In what way has the term \"aquapelago\" expanded from scientific to cultural?","answers":[{"answer":"People have used it in books, articles, and journal publications.

Calm down, calm down, deep breathes, he told himself out load.\n\nTaking a final look around the room to make sure that it was not overly romantic or too presumptuous in its setting, Mike walked to the door and peeped through the spyhole.  Oh god, there she is, even more gorgeous in the flesh than he had remembered. \n\nWith his knees like jelly, his head spinning and his insides all gooey :-), Mike opened the door.\n\nHi, said Sharon, her face warming to a soft crimson colour.

Instead, most of them spent weekend whining about comedienne Michelle Wolf, who appeared at the annual White House Correspondents’ Association dinner.\n\nIs it any wonder the president’s hysterical shrieking about “fake news” resonates with his supporters?\n\nThe loudest voices in our free press are driven almost entirely by the pursuit of profit, not the truth. At the top of that list are the right-wing propagandists who get paid millions to exalt the grievances of their predominantly white, male audience — the folks who forged Trump’s base.\n\nBut it also includes the so-called “mainstream” media, who have acted as Trump’s loyal press agents from the moment he entered politics.\n\nMichelle Wolf roasted lots of folks during her remarks, which was her job. But the comment that offended the assembled media A-listers most was the one they knew to be most disturbingly true:\n\n  _\"You guys are obsessed with Trump. Did you used to date him? Because you pretend like you hate him, but I think you love him. I think what no one in this room wants to admit is that Trump has helped all of you. He couldn't sell steaks or vodka or water or college or ties or Eric, but he has helped you. He's helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV. You helped create this monster, and now you're profiting off of him.\"_\n\nAs much as journalists hate to admit it, our Fourth Estate has been in a tacit alliance with Trump all along.\n\nHeck, they created Trump. The incessant coverage of his rallies and rants — remember all those feeds of empty podiums? — was what granted him the appearance of legitimacy. Without this attention, Trump would have remained a fringe figure, a demagogue and conman desperate to fan racial resentment into audience share.\n\nDon’t believe me? Here’s how the chairman of CBS, Les Moonves, explained it in February of 2016, speaking at a media conference sponsored by Morgan Stanley:\n\n  _“It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS … Donald’s place in this election is a good thing. Man, who would have expected the ride we’re all having right now? … The money’s rolling in and this is fun. I’ve never seen anything like this, and this is going to be a very good year for us. Sorry. It’s a terrible thing to say. But, bring it on, Donald. Keep going.”_\n\n  Ultimately, Trump and his cabal will be held accountable only if we hold ourselves accountable.\n\nEvery reporter and pundit and politician who is wasting time defending or debunking Wolf’s routine — rather than focusing on the kleptocratic aims of this administration, or the simple fact that Flint, Michigan still doesn’t have drinking water — will be judged by history. Not just as peddlers of fake news, but as the failed guardians of democracy.\n\nThe president’s ardent enablers will never hold him accountable for his corruptions, because they elected a bully to make them feel safe, not an adult who would govern.\n\nTherefore, the rest of us need to recognize our own complicity in this cycle. If we continue to focus on offensive tweets and comedy routines, our profit-mad media outlets will continue to feed us fake news.\n\nUltimately, Trump and his cabal will be held accountable only if we hold ourselves accountable.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about the White House Correspondents' Association dinner?","answers":[{"answer":"The author mentions that in contrast to the preoccupation of the media with Trump and his cult of personality, the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner took place over the weekend.

Now James Butler is a very ordinary man, living in an ordinary house with an ordinary wife and two of the most ordinary children in the world. James Butler works an ordinary job in an ordinary office, and an ordinary plant sits on the edge of his ordinary desk. When he gets home at exactly 6 in the evening, James Butler enjoys reading ordinary books or watching ordinary shows on his ordinary television. Now nothing would give us the impression that something is out of the ordinary in this man’s ordinary life. Nothing but a giant glass wall that separates James Butler from another world. Now in that other world, there lives a James Butler. Now James Butler lives a very extraordinary life. James Butler lives in the most extraordinary house with an extraordinary wife and two of the most extraordinary children in the world. James Butler works an extraordinary job in an extraordinary workplace. When he gets home, at whichever time suits him most, James Butler enjoys doing extraordinary things, like rock climbing or playing extraordinary chess championships at his extraordinary local chess club. \n\nNow, apart from the fact that James Butler is a very extraordinary man, and the other James Butler is a very ordinary man, there’s one more thing that separates these two James Butlers. When James Butler wakes up on an ordinary Monday morning, and looks in his ordinary mirror before an ordinary Monday morning shave, there is no smile on his face. There’s sadness in his eyes, and bags under his eyes from a lack of sleep. When James Butler goes to work on this very ordinary Monday morning, there is no smile on his face. When James Butler works his ordinary 8-hour shift for his ordinary job, there is no smile on his face. Now the evening, that’s where it gets interesting. In the evening, when James Butler sits in an ordinary bus to make his way home, something not quite ordinary happens. Every evening, when James Butler returns to his ordinary house from his ordinary job, he looks through the window of the bus, trying to catch a glimpse of the James Butler on the other side of glass. Trying to catch just a small glimpse of the smile that sits upon the other James Butler’s face. Now that glimpse, that small of part of joy on the other side of the glass, that is what keeps the ordinary James Butler from going insane. Now going insane would be extremely extraordinary, and an ordinary man like James Butler wouldn’t want to go extraordinary now, would he? \n\nBut there’s another reason why James Butler tries to catch a glimpse of that smile every evening. The extraordinary James Butler, who leaves his job with a smile on his face every day, had a very ordinary past. It was a fun past, but an ordinary past. He watched his children grow up in a very ordinary fashion, and he loved his ordinary wife. When his children grew up and left the house to become adults themselves, James Butler started picking up hobbies for himself, and his life became extraordinary, filled with action, suspense and fun. Now our ordinary James Butler misses this kind of ordinary past. When James Butler was still a young, energetic man, and his wife was expecting their second child, something extraordinary happened. When our ordinary James Butler was working his 8-hour shift one day, he got a very extraordinary call from the hospital. His wife and first child had been in a car accident, and both had passed away on site. After hearing this news, James Butler excused himself and made his way home, where he drank an extraordinary amount of whiskey. This excessive amount of whiskey was the last extraordinary thing to happen in James Butler’s life. From that moment onwards, joy was hard to find for James Butler, and he lived from ordinary day to ordinary day, ordinary moment to ordinary moment, trying not to succumb to his grief. Eventually, maybe as a way of dealing with the sadness, but no one could quite tell, James Butler’s wife and children returned to him. They sat at his ordinary dinner table eating an ordinary spaghetti, and they slept in their ordinary beds at night. Now James Butler kept living like this until he was an old man, but he never became the happy man he once was. The presence of this wife and children gave him some comfort, but it was an empty shell, for every evening he would look at the other side of the glass and see what his life could have been. \n\nBut when James Butler was old and dying, something extraordinary happened once more, for the last time in his life. He got up and left his ordinary old man’s chair for the first time in a long while. James Butler then made his way outside, but left his coat and his hat hanging on their ordinary hooks in the hallway. He made his way along the glass wall, looking inside the entire way. On the other side sat an old man, wearing his coat and his hat. James Butler’s grand children came to visit him often, and even after the death of his wife joy still had a place in his life. Upon seeing this sight, our ordinary James Butler clenched his fists and started hitting the glass that had separated him from joy his entire life. It hurt, but he kept on hitting and hitting. Until finally, a crack appeared on the wall. As James Butler kept punching, the crack kept getting bigger and bigger, until finally after what seemed to be an eternity, it shattered. Billions of little pieces of glass came crashing down, and for the first time since that terrible accident, James Butler stepped to the other side of the wall. \nOn that other side of the wall is where James Butler died, with a smile on his face and a sea of glass surrounding him, while the other James Butler was nowhere to be found. \n\nEDIT: Lay-out\n","title":"[MF] The story of James Butler"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story say about what led to James Butler's very ordinary life?\n","answers":[{"answer":"James Butler's ordinary life started when he got a call from the hospital informing him that his wife and first child had been in a car accident and both had passed away on site.

With them, me. I stood up on the white sanded beach and looked out into the great blue yonder. The water was so blue and clear, I could've sworn I was in the Bahamas. A moment later, I smelled iron. \"Blood\" I thought. I ripped off my white cotton dress shirt and saw the the blood oozing out of the deep lacerations on my torso. Then, the smelled of something being grilled filled the air. \"There's someone else on the island.\n   I ran to the smell as fast as humanly possible. It was the most difficult thing I've ever done. I ran so fast my muscles started to hurt. I tripped over rocks and branches multiple times which exacerbated the lacerations. When I got to the barbecue all I saw were servants and a woman in a red dress. She was no older than me, twenty. After looking around, I collapsed.\n   The next thing I remember, I was in a huge cave. Except, it didn't look like a cave. It looked like a regular home. I opened my eyes and saw the immaculate kitchen, it was like one you'd see in a five star restaurant. Annexed off the kitchen, there was a beautiful dining room. However, I got the feeling that it was just collecting dust. I was laying on a black couch big enough for two people and was snuggled up in a flannel blanket. I wanted to get up but I debated if it was worth losing the warmth. It was decided, I'd get up. As I got up, I heard a woman say \"Woah, easy there\".\n   She was the most beautiful woman in the world. She was like something out of a Greek mythology tale. She had long dark brown hair braided to the side, warm brown eyes, and smelled like honeysuckle. She looked very Mediterranean. For example, she had olive skin and strong facial features. Her voice was soft and when she talked, it sounded like angles were singing. If I didn't know any better, I'd say she was Aphrodite.\n     \"What's your name,\" I asked.\n     \"I am Calypso and you are on Ogygia\" she smiled. \"After we eat, you can go home if you'd like\".\n     \"Can I think about it\" I said looking at the island.\n     \"Sure,\" she smiled. \"Now go back to sleep, you need rest\".\n     A moment later, my eyes were closed.\n     \n                    *****\n  When I opened my eyes, I saw her smiling over me, her teeth were pure white. How could I leave her?\n  \"It's time for dinner\" she said playing with my hair.\n   When we walked out of the cave, it was night. How long was I asleep for? The only source of light were the stars and the moon. Since there was no light pollution, you could see the faintest stars. It was beautiful. On the white beach there was a blanket and several baskets.\n    \"It's a beautiful out here. Is it like this every night?\" I said looking up at the stars.\n    \"Yes it is \" she smiled while looking up at the stars.\n    The baskets had everything in them. Literally, you could think of food or drink and you'd have it. After dinner, we walked on the shores.\n   \"Will you stay with me?\" She asked. I could hear a hint of nervousness in her voice.\n   I thought about my life in the real world. I had no family, no friends, and no money. I had nothing. Why wouldn't I stay with her?\n  \"Of course I'll stay with you\" I said leaning in to kiss her.\n\n\nI hope this wasn't that bad. I'm pretty rusty.

In 2019 she was awarded the Nari Shakti Puraskar (the highest award for women in India).\n\n\nLife\n\nDevi was born in the 1960s and her background is in Sitapur.[1] She came to Kanpur when she was 14 to marry Jairaj Singh who was 18. One of her husband's jobs was to work as a floor cutter for a non-profit group called Shramik Bharti.[2]\n\nThey lived in Kanpur and she was disgusted by people defecating in the street. She said it was a “living hell” and that she intended to improve the cleanliness of her area.[3] Her husband was supportive and, when she decided that she was going to build toilets in her area, he went with her to meet Shramik Bharti. They were keen on the idea of building a 10–20 seat facility. Local corporations were approached and they offered to find 200,000 rupees if she could raise 100,000. She tried, and she did raise a good sum and more importantly enthusiasm for the idea. Eventually there was a 50-seat facility.[4] thumb|left|President Ram Nath Kovind presenting the Nari Shakti Puraskar to her She had found her role, but she wanted to do more than fund raise and organise so she decided to become a mason and Shramik Bharti found funds to assist her training.[5]\n\nBoth her husband and son-in-law died leaving her as the sole wage earner who had to provide for her daughter and two grandchildren.[6] In 2015 she was working in the shanty town of Rakhi Mandi where 700 families lived without a single toilet. Devi offered to help and persuaded WaterAid to help fund some toilets. The local community were unwilling to give land or finances as they were happy with their lot and they feared that there must be a secret agenda to the offer of help.[7] This was despite the open sewers, children and adults having to defaecate in the street and anecdotal talk of assaults and a rape.[8] She went out to build the toilets having to walk some days in pouring rain for 5 km after taking two bus rides.[9] [Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the Nari Shakti Awardees on International Women's Day in 2020.

Born in Filabusi in Matabeleland, he attended mission and government schools and trained as a builder. He worked in Bulawayo, and became a union leader and African nationalist activist. In the 1950s and 60s, he served in leadership roles in the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, National Democratic Party, and Zimbabwe African People's Union. He was detained in 1964 and, with the exception of a three-week period the following year, was held in continuous detention for the next ten years. Upon his release in 1974, he was named Organising Secretary of the ANC, and attended the Victoria Falls Conference as part of Joshua Nkomo's delegation. He died shortly after in an automobile accident driving from Salisbury (now Harare) to Bulawayo.\n\n\nEarly life\n\nNkala was born on 26 February 1927 in Filabusi, Matabeleland, Southern Rhodesia.[2][3][4] He comes from a large Ndebele family; one of his siblings, Enos, also became active in the independence movement and later served in parliament and as a cabinet minister.[5] His father, Madika Nkala, was a peasant farmer, teacher at the local Methodist mission school, and later a cobbler.[6][7][8] His mother, Mbase Moyo, was a lay preacher of the American-led Brethren in Christ Church.[9] Nkala was raised in the Brethren faith and attended primary school Nkankezi School and at the Church's Matopo Mission.[10][11] He went on to study at Mzingwane High School in Essexvale (now Esigodini), where he became exposed to politics through fellow students, including Jason Moyo and others.[12][13] There, he received elementary industrial instruction, trained as a bricklayer, and qualified as a builder in 1947.[14][15]\n\n\nCareer and political activity\n\nNkala worked in Bulawayo as a builder for many years.[16] In 1950, he was elected chairman of the Bulawayo branch of the African Artisans' Union.[17] He was elected president of the union in 1956, an office he held until his arrest in 1964.[18] He also served for some time as president of the African Trade Union Congress' Matabeleland region.[19] He was also appointed Chairman of the Barbourfields Tenants' Association and member of the Bulawayo African Townships Advisory Board.[20]\n\nIn 1957, Nkala joined the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, led by Joshua Nkomo, and served as treasurer for the organisation's Bulawayo branch until it was banned in 1959.[21] He was a prominent figure in the African nationalist movement in Bulawayo, and was briefly detained after a state of emergency was declared by the colonial government in February 1959.[22][23] He served as treasurer for the Bulawayo branch of the National Democratic Party (NDP), Nkomo's new party, from 1960 to 1961, when it, too, was banned.[24] From 1961 to 1963, Nkala was the Bulawayo district chairman for the NDP's successor, the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU).[25] In 1962, ZAPU was banned, and the next year, some of its members broke away and formed Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). Nkala remained loyal to Nkomo's organisation, while his brother Enos joined ZANU.[26][27] From 1963 to 1964, he served as National Organising Secretary of the People's Caretaker Council, a newly-founded successor organisation to ZAPU that was the same in all but name.[28][29]\n\nOn 23 April 1964, Nkala was detained by the Rhodesian government, and with the exception of a three-week period in April/May 1965, he remained in restriction or detention for over ten years.[30] He was initially held at Gonakudzingwa restriction camp, but because of his strong influence on the morale of his fellow restrictees, was moved, along with Nkomo and Joseph Msika, to Camp 5, a more isolated location.[31] There for four years, he had little human contact besides Nkomo and Msika, and began taking correspondence courses.[32] He passed his A Levels and went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts in political science and public administration from the University of South Africa.[33][34] He was released on 3 December 1974.[35]\n\nIn December 1974, Nkala was named to the Central Committee of the African National Council (ANC), and attended the Victoria Falls Conference in August 1975 along with Nkomo as part of the ANC delegation.[36][37] When the ANC split internally in September 1975, Nkala remained loyal to Nkomo's faction, and was named organising secretary at the party's congress, held in Salisbury (now Harare) on 26 and 27 September 1975.[38]\n\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nAround 2:30 p.m., 3 December 1975, exactly one year after his release from detention, Nkala was killed on the Salisbury-Bulawayo Road near Bembezi when his car overturned.[39][40][41][42] The ANC colleague he was traveling with, Aggrippah Moyo, was also killed.[43] A joint funeral held for Nkala and Moyo in Bulawayo was attended by thousands.[44][45] Joshua Nkomo spoke at the burial, stating that Nkala's and Moyo's death would not be in vain, and that Zimbabweans would achieve the independence the two died while fighting for.[46] Nkala left behind a widow and five children.[47] He was buried at Pelandaba Cemetery in Bulawayo, and was declared a national hero after independence in 1980.[48] In November 2019, 1st Avenue in Bulawayo was renamed Lazarus Nkala Avenue.[49]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n\n[27] \n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] \n\n[31] \n\n[32] \n\n[33] \n\n[34] \n\n[35] \n\n[36] \n\n[37] \n\n[38] \n\n[39] \n\n[40] \n\n[41] \n\n[42] \n\n[43] \n\n[44] \n\n[45] \n\n[46] \n\n[47] \n\n[48] \n\n[49] \n","title":"Lazarus Nkala"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text have to say about Nkala's politics after 1960?","answers":[{"answer":"Nkala was elected president of the African Trade Union Congress' Matabeleland region.

Savage in his book, \"The Millennial Project\". By no means am I claiming his works as my own. I respect his creation and wanted to incorporate this part of it into my ongoing tale.)\n\n\nA public works project had begun in Tanzania on Mt. Kilimanjaro. To the press it had been dubbed a water and energy reclamation experiment, and to the water impoverished nations of Africa they didn't question it too loudly. Why question something that would bring thousands of jobs and clean water to the stricken center of the continent, and let's not forget millions, (perhaps billions if you could really dig into the books and ferret out all the nickels and dimes) of dollars of industry? On the surface, the construct did exactly what it said. There were no lies told. The engineers had built vast sluices to harness and channel the melt from the heavy snows that had been steadily increasing at the peak of the volcano. \"This increase in snowfall was an effect of the changing climate brought about by human influence on global temperatures\", a few interest groups were shouting at the top of their lungs, \"and we should be devoting energies to stem the changes and not just blindly take advantage of them!\" They shouted, but no one was listening. Besides, the extra snowfall handled and distributed by what became known as the Kilimanjaro Resource Reclamation Project jointly managed by the central African countries, the US, and after a fashion, the UK, revitalized one of the most impoverished areas on Earth. \n\nThe three gargantuan sluices were evenly distributed around the circumference on the mountain's even-sloped rise, and from there each of the three bases branched out to smaller and smaller distribution channels like tree roots, (but moving water in the opposite direction) to the surrounding areas. Using the support pylons for the sluices as foundations, massive turbines were constructed creating wind farms, some classic propeller driven, a few using a new air-compressed turbine technology. With these farms, vast amounts of energy was produced and distributed along the water pipelines. With one well engineered stroke, the project cured much of the strife in Africa bringing water, energy, jobs, and outside interest to the nations. That outside interest being tourism of course, the universal income maker. With the violent rebellions dying down, and much of the varied countries slowly but surely working their way through peace talks and economic summits, the central African countries became a new and fresh tourist destination, bringing even more money to the table.\n\nIt was quite a generous act from the First World, again, on the surface. But, does it really matter after that? With all of the good the project had brought to millions of people, did the underlying reasons detract from the gesture? Much of the grand gestures in history had one hand giving and the other taking, and sometimes the price of what was taken was monumental and horrific. From where I sit here in the Salt Flats, I wonder.\n\nYou see, two of the sluices were just that: water collectors. They were labeled the  Kilimanjaro First and Second Arms respectively, or K1A and K2A. The third, which happened to be built directly parallel to the equator, was much larger than the other two, (and had an exponentially larger amount of security than the other two), housed a secret. There was indeed a water reclamation facility built there, (there were no overt lies spoken, remember), it just had one more pathway built into it that was never meant to be touched by water,\nAnd just a small fraction of the energy created by the wind farms were diverted to this facility to power it. Knowing that the facility would eventually have to be revealed, the right amount of money had been exchanged to the right hands, (certain heads of the African nations, and as always, the press) to keep the project quiet, but be a loud and positive supporter when the time came for the unveiling.\n\nHoused under this third arm was a thirty mile long set of rails. There was a subtle opening at the peak of the mountain that was the exit for the projected launch vehicle. The passage was essentially a gun, a \"rail gun\" apparatus first imagined by French inventor Louis Octave Fauchon-Villeplee in 1918.  It was a device that, using two parallel conductive rails that were fed an electromagnetic current in a pulse traveling the length of the barrel, could accelerate an object at extremely high velocity, no chemical propellant required.\n\nThe setting of Kilimanjaro had been ideal for a couple of reasons: the long slope stretching up from the flat plain was a perfect platform to build the rail, and it's closeness to the equator. The long slope allowed for minimum construction (and minimum visibility from the outside world) to set the shape of the track. The extra benefit of the height of the mountain meant that the catapulted object would make it quite a ways up in elevation before it even left the track, meaning less energy spent. The location along the equator was ideal in that anything launched would require minimal adjustments once in orbit to attain a geosynchronicity circling the planet, or to orbital trajectories further out, say. It was these outbound trajectories that were important for the second stage of the project. The third stage would change the world.\n\nOnce the rail, dubbed the Kilimanjaro Third Arm Launch Facility (or K3ALF for a slightly less unwieldy title) had been finished, there was a massive marketing push to popularize it and as always, it was easier to ask for forgiveness after the fact than for the initial permissions. After a few test runs; the brave astronautical test pilot's proud and triumphant (widely broadcast across the internet and televisions of the world) flight, not to forget his grinning mug, (also widely broadcast) telling the citizens just how beautiful their small blue world was from where he sat and that humanity should get over their petty squabbles, blah blah blah, and the usual insertion or two of new commercial satellites, (to pay for the previous' advertising), the project was much lauded for it's forward thinking and advancement of Mankind. Once the launch facility was fully operational, it was not unusual to hear the distant thunder from a bullet-shaped vehicle hitting multiple times the speed of sound and leaving nothing but a vapor contrail and a wide cloud halo around the peak of the slumbering volcano. \n\nThe third phase began with renewed landings on Earth's lonely companion, the Moon. And at the beginning of the new year, a permanent facility had been constructed in the Copernicus crater that utilized the sloping wall along with the relative flatness of it's basin, (in a slightly funhouse mirror image) to build a smaller sister version of the Kilimanjaro launch rail for the benefit of propelling craft on their return trip to Terra Firma. The public was told that the construction in Copernicus, (named the Arthur C. Clarke Platform; it wasn't in Clavius or the Tycho Crater but the name was fitting, and no one objected to honoring the famous co-author of \"2001 - A Space Odyssey\") would be primarily used to explore the lunar surface, research into the rocky terrain for the possibilities of future mineral prospects, and mainly; mankind's first proper foothold into space proper, where the foundation of exploration to the outer reaches of the solar system would begin.\n\nThese things were all true; proper and successful lies are always obfuscated in a web of truth. As it had been since the beginning of the massive project, there were no lies told. It was what went by unsaid that paid for all in the end. Ironically, this venture having been covered up until it was ready at K3ALF by the publics works programs was in turn a cover for the real strategy, a plan that only a handful of people outside the project were aware of.  Even the majority of the crews at the Arthur C. Clarke site were unaware of what they were a part of and if they were told, they probably wouldn't have believed it anyway.\n\n(6/16/16)","title":"[SP] The Third Arm of Kilimanjaro"},"questions":[{"question":"What was the main aim of the public works (Kilimanjaro Resource Reclamation) that were set up in Tanzania?","answers":[{"answer":"The main aim was to provide water, energy and jobs to millions of people living in Africa.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention the other aims of the project.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"It's omitted that the project also revitalized one of the most impoverished areas on Earth.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that the project also revitalized the tourism industry.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer is not fully accurate.

I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me.

Especially after her break up with Todd, the leather jacket douche that called her “babe” so much I would wonder if he knew her real name.\n\n“I promise you’ll have a great time,” Nina had told me. And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle.

The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room.

I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry.

The poem acquired some fame as teaching material for English teachers.\n\n\nForm and summary\n\n“Reuben Bright” is a sonnet with decasyllabic lines of iambic pentameter.[2] Its structure is that of the Petrarchan sonnet according to Stephen Regan;[3] its rhyme scheme is abba abba cdcd ee. In other words, the octet has two quatrains of enclosed rhyme, and the sestet has a quatrain of alternating rhyme and a concluding couplet.\n\nThe poem tells of a butcher, Reuben Bright, who might be supposed to be rough and unfeeling because of his profession, but when news is brought that his wife is to die, he cries like a baby. When she dies, he packs up all the articles she handcrafted in a chest and adds cedar boughs (a “traditional symbol of death”[4]) and then destroys the slaughter house. One critic said the poem shows “a man's devotion to his wife”.[5] Like many of Robinson's narrative sonnets, “Reuben Bright” has a “characteristic signature: usually a bizarre or extraordinary story”, according to Donald Hall, who also noted that in its first printing the last line was altered significantly by a typo: the poem had been printed with the last line saying “tore down _to_ the slaughter house”.[6]\n\n\nCritical appreciation\n\nRobinson wrote “Reuben Bright” around the same time as “Richard Cory”. David Perkins, in his _A History of Modern Poetry_ (first published 1976), called some of those early poems including “Reuben Bright” and “Richard Cory” “revolutionary”, with narrative elements of prose fiction brought into a lyric poetry written about realistic subject matter in vernacular language.[7] Stephen Regan likewise notes the “plain-speaking, intimately conversational idiom”. The poem's value, he argues, lies in the tension between that “matter-of-fact” language (and the close tonal connection between, for instance, “Bright” and “brute”) and the psychological depths Robinson hints at, opened by the butcher's “capacity for deep feeling”.[8] Robinson critic Warner Berthoff had said that “Robinson is the poet of casualties; of broken lives and exhausted consciences”, and Regan saw Reuben Bright as the best example of this quality.[9]\n\nUnlike a regular sonnet of this form whose dramatic turn can be expected to come between the octet and the sestet, “Reuben Bright” has no such dramatic change in “mood or attitude”, just a narrative development. An ironic twist does not come until the last line, which, as Milton R. Stern noted, is a device frequently found in Robinson's poetry.[10] Poet and critic Donald Hall also commented on the structure, and did note a kind of conclusion at the end of the octave: “Robinson's octave ends with wild grief; but the active imagination of the sestet is his genius--the cow-killer converted”.[11]\n\n\nUse in teaching literature\n\nMilton Stern, writing in 1957 considered the sonnet to be an excellent poem to teach poetry to students who might have gotten jaded with traditional sonnets, and are challenged to try and figure out how the shocking ending results from the death of Bright's wife. That the poem does all this with rather ordinary language and without traditional poetic elements is important as well: “the student can more easily see that poetry does speak to our own human condition”. According to Stern, “Robinson constantly takes 'little' people, 'ordinary' people, who lead the 'usual' life of all of us, and finds therein the dramatic, the poetic, and the human”.[12] In an article published two years after, Stern again suggested “Reuben Bright”, along with a few other Robinson poems, as very useful “Poems for Teaching”.[13]\n\nMartha Fisher, in a discussion of the process-intervention model in teaching literature, mentioned “Reuben Bright” (and “Richard Cory”) as a narrative poem that students could be asked to rewrite as a short story or a play.[14]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n","title":"Reuben Bright"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the structure of this poem.","answers":[{"answer":"The poem is a sonnet with decasyllabic lines of iambic pentameter.

It has been months of hectic work, and she was finally happy to go home and relax. As she drove down the familiar route, her mind went on a journey of its own – down the memory lane. All her childhood years, all the events that made her the woman she was today, flashed before her eyes.\r\n\nAs she reveled in the memories, the flashing lights and wailing sirens pulled her from dreamland back into reality.\r\n\n“What the hell” she spoke to herself. “I wasn’t speeding”\r\n\nShe was ready to give the officer a piece of her mind, when she realized that the car wasn’t after her.

Prisoners escaped all the time and their closest target would be her town. She glared at the prison as she drove past it.\r\n\nShe turned on the radio to take her mind off things. Music always made her feel better. Just as she crossed a signpost that said she was five miles from her destination, she saw a guy sticking out his thumb. He was muscular, and dressed in formals.

Would you be so kind to give me a lift?”\r\n\n“Sure Joseph, hop in. I’m Amanda, by the way.” \r\n\nAmanda liked picking up hitchhikers.

You’re a native. My mother was from River Heights, so the place is always special to me”\r\n\nThey continued exchanging stories, as the car approached a small path that broke off the highway.\r\n\n“That’s the way to the cabin” Joseph said, sounding excited.\r\n\nAs they drove down the dark path, an unsettling feeling came over Amanda. But she kept driving, as the path suddenly ended in the middle of a forest.\r\n“Umm... Joseph? Where’s the cabin you--” A sharp blow to her face stopped the sentence in half.\r\nJoseph got out of the car, pulled Amanda out, and shoved her on the ground. She tried getting up, only to get hit again.\r\n\n“You know Amanda” he said, ripping off her shirt. “Picking hitchhikers around a prison is a foolish thing to do. They might turn out to be a killer. Lucky for you, I’m merely a rapi--”\r\n\nHe froze, as he felt a cold intrusion in his chest. He looked down to see blood dripping down the slit between his ribs. Amanda shoved him off and stood over him, with her favourite knife covered in his blood.\r\n\n“Speaking of foolish things, you should never get in a stranger’s car, especially a stranger who grew up around a prison”, she said with a maniacal smile in her face. “Like you said, they might turn out to be a killer”\r\n\nJoseph gasped, as the cold knife proceeded to taste more of his blood.

And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle. Something nostalgic about repetitive rap songs preaching about the wonders of big asses. \n\nEverything seemed normal at first. The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room. I could feel the air thickening. \n\nMinutes before terror, I was standing unnoticed next to a group of girls I recognized. \n\n“Someone told me her dad was abusive,” I heard one say with wide eyes. \n\n“Yeah, apparently the neighbors called the cops on them,” another responded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t point fingers just yet. Nina’s mom’s a bitch. Maybe she deserved it,” a brunette shrugged and took a sip of her drink right before our eyes met. Her face flared red as she realized her words had been overhead. I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry. A millisecond later, I spotted Nina on the floor. Hands covering her face in defense. The lack of light in the room didn’t stop the fierceness of her blood as it dripped down her temple and into her hair. \n\nI stood still. My brain called in fear but my body made no response. Not even when Todd walked passed me, into the hallway and shut the door behind him. \n\nNina remained on the floor. She held herself and rocked back and forth, letting silent cries out into the thick air. \n\n“Don’t tell anyone.” She whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” Max snapped at me. “Are you going to tell me or not?” I stared at him blankly as the vivid flashbacks flew through my head. My heart stung in bitterness as I recognized that all I wanted to do was say it. To write it out in sharpie on all student lockers.\n\nNina’s bloody face burned in my head. “There’s nothing to tell.”","title":"[RF] Last Night Leftovers"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the passage say about Todd?","answers":[{"answer":"Todd is Nina's ex-boyfriend.

The Belgian Police detected that the IP address, where threat messages were sent to Turkish journalists via some social media, belongs to the Turkish Embassy in Brussels.\n\nThe headline news of Het Laatste Nieuws (HLN,) one of the bestselling newspaper in Belgium, on Friday has reported that The IP addresses of the threat messages indicates the Turkish Embassy in Brussels. The prosecutor’s office carrying out the investigation also confirmed the information.\n\nThe Brussels’ Bureau Chief of the closed newspaper Zaman; Selçuk Gültaşlı and other correspondents were pointed as a target after the controversial coup attempt on July 15, 2016 by twitter users named ‘Veysel Filiz’ and ‘Selim Güzel.’ Veysel Filiz was the Press Consultant of the Turkish Embassy for that time.\n\nTurkish journalist R. filed a criminal complaint about the Twitter accounts, which sent posts to be in scope of hate crimes. The investigation has been going on for one and a half year. The Belgian Police’s inquiry focused on the accounts named Selim Güzel (@selimguzel_FC) and Veysel Filiz, the Press Consultant of the Embassy.\n\nAccording to the news of HLN, Zaventem Police informed R. a few weeks ago and said that they detected that one of the IP addresses who was threatening him belonged to the Turkish Embassy. R. took the record as an official report.\n\nIt is also stated that the prosecutor’s office had a difficult time as the investigation gained a diplomatic character. Therefore, the paper has reported that, the investigation has proceeded very slowly for the last few months because of its political and diplomatic sensitivity. The former press official of the Turkish Embassy was also in a diplomatic status.\n\nJeroen Bosaert, the journalist who signed the news report, called the Turkish Embassy and asked for information. He asked the Embassy officials if they knew anyone called Selim Güzel. But he received a reply that they didn’t know anyone with that name, and that person didn’t work for the embassy either.\n\nNevertheless, Bosaert kept on his search and revealed Selim Güzel’s previous posts on twitter as he was someone working for the Embassy. For instance, on July 27, 2016 he posted “We attended Europe Islamophobia Summit in Sarajevo. We were with Volkan Kocagül from our Ministry of the EU. The topic is dimensional, I will write about it.” And Volkan Kocagül was a high ranking diplomat at the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nJournalist Bosaert has reported the contradiction in the Turkish Embassy’s statements, and he highlighted that the twitter user Selim Güzel was occasionally with Turkish ministers and diplomats.\n\nR. filed his first complaint about the threats on social media on the next day of the controversial coup attempt on July 15, 2016. The reason was, Veysel Filiz @veysel_FILIZ tagged R. and posted “Do not rejoice so soon, we are marking your lairs.”\n\nJournalist filed his second complaint in September 2016 for Selim Güzel. The reason for that was, Güzel mentioned R. and posted “the Belgium Media Hitman of FETÖ” the same tweet included a list of other Turkish journalists who were targeted, too. The investigation about Güzel’s social media posts was in process since then.\n\n“FETÖ” is a pejorative acronym that Turkey’s political Islamist government has been using to defame the Gülen movement.\n\nIt was also stated in the report that R. was secretly taken in police protection for six months. Journalist told the Stockholm Center for Freedom (SCF) that he had just learned this information, too. This information was in the investigation file. After his complaint, the Belgian police in disguise had taken security precautions around his house for six months. Local police had checked out around his house, too. He felt himself more secure then. “This is something good. It is a substantial feeling,” he said and added that he felt he was leaving in democratically and lawfully developed country.\n\nR. has also talked about his complaints and stated that they were journalists in Brussels following the agenda of Belgium and Turkey’s EU relations. He said that “We were not related to and interested in the local events in Turkey. We were shaken when the Zaman daily in Turkey was seized. We lost our jobs. A few months later the coup attempt occurred. We began to be threatened here. Therefore, I customarily went to the police. I felt it as a security issue. Because, physical assaults had already started here.”\n\nR. has also commented on the stage of the investigation process and stated that “The prosecutor’s office might have been incapacitated. Because the suspects have diplomatic immunity. Legal intervention to the Embassy may not be possible. They will wait and see how far the investigation could go.”\n\nTake a second to support SCF on Patreon!\n\n[]\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about how to trace IP addresses?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer is not provided in the text.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is not relevant to the question.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"Nothing in the input seems to answer this","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"Doesn't answer the question.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"No answer is given, but the article does discuss how Belgian police tracked the IP addresses","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"There is no answer because it is unknown how to trace IP addresses.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is not found in the text.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"There is no answer to the question.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"There is no answer.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The article does not discuss how to trace IP addresses.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"There's a lot of information on tracing IP addresses in this article.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"There's no answer as it isn't mentioned.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The article does not explicitly state how to trace IP addresses.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"No response is given, when one is clearly needed.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The article does not mention how to trace IP addresses.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What does the article say about Turkish Embassy activities in Belgium?","answers":[{"answer":"The Turkish Embassy's Press Consultant, Selim Güzel, posted a lot of threats on twitter to the journalists Selcuk Gultasli and other correspondents.

Having “Wonderboy” headline the card seems like a natural fit, and he has every intention of taking that spot as long as he’s physically capable.\n\nThompson already has an opponent in mind, too. He’s long pursued a matchup with former UFC welterweight champ Robbie Lawler (28-13 MMA, 13-7 UFC), and he hopes that fight can finally materialize.\n\n“Lawler is definitely the fight I’ve been wanting for a while,” Thompson told reporters, including MMA Junkie, at UFC on ESPN+ 6 media day. “I’ve been a big fan of him and he’s been such a monster in the welterweight division. I thought he looked great in his last fight with Ben (Askren). He looked really strong and just really focused. I think that year off gave him some time to heal up and get his mind right. I think that would be awesome.\n\n“I know there’s a card happening in Greenville, S.C., my hometown, three months from now. Hopefully come out of this fight unscathed and we’ll make that fight happen.”\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 6 takes place at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tenn. Thompson vs. Pettis headlines the card, which streams on ESPN+.\n\nThompson said he was close to booking a January showdown with Lawler. However, “Ruthless” said prior to his UFC 235 bout with Ben Askren earlier this month that the matchup was never on the table. Thompson begs to differ, but all of that is in the past, and he hopes they can make it happen in the future.\n\n“To us it was (happening),” Thompson said. “The word we were getting is it was happening. It wasn’t until the fight – I was up in New York with Chris Weidman during his fight (at UFC 230) is when I actually found out he was fighting Askren. Up until then it looked like we would fight him. I don’t know if that was UFC or his coaches, I don’t know what the whole plan was there, but for a little while there it looked like it was a for sure thing. But things happen.”\n\nThe matchup with Lawler, No. 9 in the latest USA TODAY Sports/MMA Junkie MMA welterweight rankings, has slipped through his fingers before, and No. 5-ranked Thompson said he hopes it doesn’t happen again. With Tyron Woodley no longer champion at 170 pounds, Thompson has renewed championship aspirations and thinks beating Pettis and Lawler in back-to-back fights would give him a strong case to challenge current titleholder Kamaru Usman.\n\n“I think a big win over Pettis is going to put me back in the limelight,” Thompson said. “It’s been almost 10 months since I fought and out of sight out of mind. People stop talking about you, forget about you and I just want to let everyone know that I’m still here. But a win over Lawler – he’s a former welterweight champion. He’s one of the best strikers in the division and has been in the game for a while.\n\n“It may not move me up (in the rankings), but it still shows everybody I’m here if I can do what I’m going to do Saturday and fight Lawler in my hometown and prove that, ‘Stephen is still here, let’s give him that shot again.'”\n\nFor more on UFC on ESPN+ 6, check out the UFC Rumors section of the site.\n\nBreaking, Robbie Lawler, Stephen Thompson, UFC on ESPN+ 11, UFC on ESPN+ 6, News, UFC\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about why Thompson wants to fight Lawler?","answers":[{"answer":"Thompson has been a big fan of Lawler and thinks he's a monster in the welterweight division.

The money from the Trump administration will help Mexico increase deportations of Central Americans.]\n\nCredit...Meghan Dhaliwal for The New York Times\n\n-   Sept. 12, 2018\n\nWASHINGTON — President Trump has promised for years that Mexico would pay for a vast border wall, a demand that country has steadfastly refused. Now, in the Trump administration’s campaign to stop illegal immigration, the United States plans instead to pay Mexico.\n\nIn a recent notice sent to Congress, the administration said it intended to take $20 million in foreign assistance funds and use it to help Mexico pay plane and bus fare to deport as many as 17,000 people who are in that country illegally.\n\nThe money will help increase deportations of Central Americans, many of whom pass through Mexico to get to the American border. Any unauthorized immigrant in Mexico who is a known or suspected terrorist will also be deported under the program, according to the notification, although such people are few in number.\n\nKatie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the program was intended to help relieve immigration flows at the United States border with Mexico.\n\n“We are working closely with our Mexican counterparts to confront rising border apprehension numbers — specifically, a 38 percent increase in families this month alone — directly and to ensure that those with legitimate claims have access to appropriate protections,” Ms. Waldman said.\n\nA spokesman for the Mexican Embassy did not immediately respond Wednesday to a request for comment.\n\nThe plan, which has been debated internally for months, is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to redirect billions in foreign assistance to other priorities. The administration has yet to spend nearly $3 billion in foreign aid, money allocated last year by Congress with broad bipartisan support. Hundreds of millions of dollars meant to help stabilize Syria and support Palestinian schools and hospitals has already been redirected.\n\nWhile the administration has made several announcements about not spending on priorities Congress intended, it has mostly kept quiet about what it will do with the money. But it has long been frustrated that Congress provides billions for foreign aid while refusing to fund its immigration priorities. The money will be transferred from the State Department to the Department of Homeland Security, and then sent to Mexico.\n\n“Congress intended for this money to lift up communities dealing with crime, corruption and so many other challenges, not to expand this administration’s deportation crusade,” said Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “I want answers about why the State Department thinks it can ignore Congress and dump more cash into deportation efforts. Until then, I’ll do whatever I can to stop this.”\n\nThe maneuver is the latest by the administration to reduce the number of immigrants crossing the southwestern border. The most prominent piece of the effort has been the “zero tolerance” policy to criminally prosecute any immigrant who enters the country without authorization. That led to the widely criticized practice of separating children from their parents at the border, which spurred a humanitarian and political crisis for Mr. Trump.\n\nBut the president’s advisers have also employed other strategies to deter immigrants, including revamping the rules surrounding who can qualify for asylum and trying to strike an agreement with Mexico that would disqualify any migrant who had not sought asylum there from claiming it in the United States.\n\nUnder the program, Mexico would be responsible for detaining and providing judicial review of immigrants before deporting them. The sometimes cumbersome and lengthy legal process in the United States to deport asylum seekers has long frustrated Mr. Trump, who has often said the laws must be changed to speed deportations. Getting Mexico to do deportations instead would bypass that process.\n\nImmigrant advocacy groups called the deportation aid for Mexico a misguided and wasteful use of money that would fail to address the problems prompting migrants to travel to Mexico and the United States in the first place.\n\n“We shouldn’t be paying another country to do our dirty work; we should actually be fixing our immigration system and helping these countries get back on solid footing,” said Ali Noorani, the executive director of the National Immigration Forum. “It smacks of desperation.”\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Why are people willing to break the law to illegally immigrate to the United States?","answers":[{"answer":"That information can't be found.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer can be found in the text.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The article indicates that many people are motivated by the desire to escape violence and poverty, though not necessarily in that order.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer can be found in the article.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The article mentions the problems that immigrants are trying to escape.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The question should be how does the Trump administration plan on discouraging people - not why","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The article does mention some of the reasons people are willing to break the law to immigrate to the United States.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The article does give some reasons why people are willing to break the law to immigrate to the US.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null}]}}

A cheap-ass, sun-faded, rusted-over excuse of an amusement park stuck just outside a notorious ghetto right off the freeway.  \n\n\nNo shit. Zulu.  \n\n\nI kid you not; the motif was *jungle adventure*. Fiberglass lions and gorillas lurching about. Man-sized tribal masks announcing the park rules. Plastic trees and a couple of pock-marked rubber crocodiles floating in the unnatural electric blue water of a concrete pool. Are you ready for the mascot? Yes, you got it - a saucer-eyed, cartoon pygmy with a bone through its nose and hair like it just stuck it's dick in an electrical outlet. Cutouts of Zinger-Zu in front of every ride telling kids how tall they had to be....  \n\n\nSo egregious, it soared right over \"unacceptably offensive\" and landed square on \"ironically acceptable kitsch.\" And it was located in Dallas County, Texas, so that helped.  \n\n\nVirgil had been born into the ghetto that sprawled behind the zig-zag shadows of Zulu's dilapidated roller coasters. As a very young child, that park represented the promise of magic, adventure and mystery. Of course, money being money, he'd never been allowed to visit during those innocent years; and you grow up fast in the ghetto, so by the time Virgil actually did get to pass through the wrought iron gates for a sample of jungle paradise, he was already too old to believe in voodoo or hippopotamuses. No, as a pre-teen and teenager, he went to Zulu exclusively to buy weight and sell dime-bags to suburbanites from Fort Worth.  \n\n\nHe'd never had the chance or, later, the inclination to ride a single ride.  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \n\n\nOlder now, Virgil had lived 35 years, married twice, and had four kids. He stood six foot two inches, still trim at two hundred pounds. He had a good job in the city; a respectable house in the suburbs. His current girlfriend was able to trick him into church on Sunday mornings because she knew how to handle him on Saturday nights. If he wasn't careful, she'd become #3.  \n\n\nHe was driving down the freeway with his youngest son, Wayne, and the child made a curious noise when they passed the almost illegibly weathered sign for \"Zulu! Live the Adventure!\"  \n\n\n\"What?\" Virgil asked his boy.  \n\n\n\"Zulu...,\" the child said. \"Zoo?\"  \n\n\n\"Nah.\" Virgil laughed. \"But good guess. Hey, you know....\"  \n\n\nVirgil checked the mirrors and exited the freeway. \"You want to live the adventure, little man?\"  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \n\n\nWayne's mother was crazy. Not quite rising to the level of court mandated institutionalization, but Virgil figured that was only more bizarre road-rage incident away. Nevertheless, for all her batshit inclinations, she was very smart. Once she'd told Virgil that her IQ had been tested in the genius level. And he believed her. But, really, what did it matter if you could mentally convert ounces to grams or recite poetry from memory if you couldn't buy a dress without getting into a vicious fight with the saleslady, knocking over the window display, and getting chased out of the mall by a team of rent-a-cops?  \n\n\nVirgil was well rid of that situation; but he enjoyed spending time with their child. The boy seemed to have acquired his mother's intelligence, with none of the insanity. Virgil supposed it was bad form to pick favorites, but of all his children, Wayne was the only one he actively troubled himself to spend time with. All the others were dropped off by mandate; but Virgil would go out of his way to pick up Wayne and gladly hold on to him an extra couple of hours or even an entirely unscheduled day when the situation called for it.  \n\n\nWayne was Virgil's little man. He was a calm, thoughtful, observant and sharp child. His soft, brown eyes took in everything, then his brow would furrow or his smile would widen depending on the situation, and then he'd react in a delightfully mature and appropriate manner. It gave Virgil a sense of peace and rightness, walking hand in hand with his little man.  \n\n\nJust as they did passing through the gates of the Zulu amusement park together; Virgil having purchased two tickets to spend some time reliving his past and sharing the experience with his son.  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \n\n\n\"I used to come here pretty much every night when I was a teen,\" Virgil told Wayne. They were strolling down the market street, past the arcade, souvenir shops, and overpriced food stands. All the buildings were in need of paint and repair - the wood beam facades were chipped and rutted, sporting plenty of graffiti, and the roofs that were supposed to be thatched with palm-leafs had large bare sections of corrugated metal shining through. \"It hasn't changed much,\" Virgil said, sadly.  \n\n\nAs they continued through the park, Virgil would offer to take Wayne on some of the rides - Voom Voom Vulture! Zambizi Zinger! Python Plunge! - but the boy judiciously shook his head to the negative. It wasn't fear, just common sense. Everything looked so rickety and sketchy; even if the cabs didn't fall off their disintegrating rails, it certainly didn't look like much fun to be jerked around in those rusty metal buckets for three minutes of bad track.  \n\n\n\"How about go-karts?\" Virgil suggested. Wayne considered this for a moment and then smiled.  \n\n\n\"Okay,\" he agreed. \"Go-karts sound good.\"  \n ","title":"[RF] Lets try this again"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the plot of the story.","answers":[{"answer":"Virgil is driving his son down the freeway when he spots Zulu amusement park.

Notify me when available\" button where the peach \"Add to bag\" button briefly was. According to the Peach & Lily team, what made so many people jump at the chance to buy it is that it's so good at \"de-gunking\" skin through gentle resurfacing. In fact, Peach & Lily founder Alicia Yoon, who suffers from eczema, says this is the first chemical peel gentle enough for her to use.\n\nAnd it probably didn't hurt that Peach & Lily's Instagram account posted a video right before the launch featuring a video of the mask gleaming in its jar. It's truly hypnotizing.\n\nIf you've got your heart set on snagging a Super Reboot Resurfacing Mask for yourself, don't worry — Peach & Lily is working on getting it back in stock, and you can be one of the first to know of its triumphant return by clicking on the aforementioned \"notify me\" button.\n\nUPDATE (JULY 16, 2018): After nearly two months, the wait is finally over: Peach & Lily's in-house skin-care collection, announced in late May, makes its official debut today. And while it may be small, the demand for the line is expected to be mighty, considering two of the products already flew off virtual, pre-sale shelves.\n\nThose two already-popular products are collection's hero formula, Glass Skin Refining Serum, and the Original Glow Sheet Mask, which sold out on both peachandlily.com and QVC.\n\nPeach & Lily is also launching the Super Reboot Resurfacing Mask, a wash-off formula that gently exfoliates; Matcha Pudding Antioxidant Cream, a free-radical-fighting moisturizer, and Pure Beam Luxe Oil, which provides fatty acids and antioxidants to reinforce skin's protective barrier. Each product in the collection averages about $40, except for the Original Glow Sheet Mask, which is available individually for $6 and in a set of 20 for $79.\n\nIn addition to its promise of effectiveness, the Peach & Lily skin-care collection has also sworn off many of the ingredients that turn shoppers off, including animal fats, detergents, mineral oil, parabens, petrolatum, phthalates, and synthetic fragrances.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_This post originally appeared on May 24, 2018:_\n\nKorean beauty retailer Peach & Lily has established itself as one of the must-shop websites for emerging and beloved K-beauty brands like Saturday Skin, Femmue, and Mizon. With the exception of its CVS collaboration, Peach Slices, however, the company hadn't ventured into making its own products. Until now, that is.\n\nThe brand posted three simple videos to Instagram announcing the arrival of Peach & Lily's very own skin-care collection, starting with a serum. \"🎉✨WE’RE OVER THE MOON EXCITED✨🎉 Introducing...Peach & Lily skincare! ✨🎉\" the caption of the first video reads. \"We’ve been quietly developing this dreamy line for you for two years. We set out to create a skincare line that gives you everything: proven results, clean and safe formulas, fresh ingredients, decadent textures. Results, delight and safety. 💫 We launched our site seven years ago without fanfare or a big party, instead we launched with the most important thing in focus: connecting with you. It only felt right to share about this launch — our most passionate endeavor yet at Peach & Lily - the same way we did on day one. An earnest, pared-down message that keeps you in the focal point, always.\"\n\nThe caption goes on to say that the full collection will launch in the summer, but the second video's caption announced a pre-sale for the very first product, called Glass Skin Refining Serum. \"A breakthrough formula that delivers translucent, poreless, radiant, refined skin. That elusive glass skin is now yours.\" Well, it's not yours _yet_. The $39 serum — called a \"revolutionary cocktail of peach extract, niacinamide, East Asian mountain yam, madecassoside, peptides, and hyaluronic acid\" in its description — is already sold out. However, you do have the option of being notified when orders are being taken again.\n\nA third video encourages fans to follow Peach & Lily founder Alicia Yoon for a behind-the-scenes look at product development and insight into how the collection started.

That means I recently got into writing; I've done some shorts here and there, and I mostly kept these to myself, but I recently became confident enough to share some of these stories. That said, I've also come to appreciate honest criticism as a way to grow stronger.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read it.\n\nA Trip To the Dentist\n-\n\nA few years ago I read an article about a man who had gotten into trouble when a newspaper reporter learned that he was operating a “dental clinic” in his basement. He managed to brush off the reporter by saying that it was his own private museum, but by then he became somewhat notorious for actually doing dental work.\n\nThis got me thinking two things: first, whenever I go to a museum, most of the exhibits aren’t in any shape to be doing what they were originally meant to be doing. Ever see an axe at the museum? They’re all rusty and missing bits, and they’d probably vapourize under the pressure of trying to get stuck in a tree. I think the reason I’ve never seen much in the way of dentistry at the Royal Ontario Museum is because they’re afraid it would scare people away from the museum and terrify what few people otherwise brave the dentist today!\n\nI’m one of the lucky few who’s never had a bad experience at the dentist, so a few years ago, when I hadn’t gotten a proper dental cleaning in a decade, it wasn’t out of fear, but out of ignorance. When I think about gaps in what I think I know, I try to fill them in, and that was my second thought: that with the Internet, you can learn ANYTHING! We have the combined power of Wikipedia and YouTube, and surely someone saw a void in the at-home orthodontist video market. And so, keen to learn about something new, I unassumingly decided to look up dentistry.\n\nWhat a horrific mistake that was…\n\nThere were a few videos, with some cautionary messages at the beginning. Usually it was people describing the bone-melting acids they’d use to etch the surface of a tooth, followed by details skimming over the dangers of the medical-grade epoxies they use to seal up valleys and cracks. Amateur dentists take great pride in their work, and with good reason: few people know anyone who talks about their surgical hobbies, and I imagine fewer still would be eager to assist with performing surgery. They need to act solo.\n\nNovocain can’t exactly be bought off the shelf, either – the only practical solution is to either take a pile of pain killers (which makes it hard to co-ordinate) or “go clean”, without taking anything to prepare (due to the potential of extreme pain, this makes it harder to co-ordinate). And then the bleeding. And then the diseases, not from the original cavity, but from the botches and failures! I’ve read about tattoo artists who can ink their own skin, but slipping means either going with the flow or covering up, not trying to find a donor set of teeth while wrangling penicillin from strangers on a long weekend; patching a tooth isn’t a two-hour chore.\n\nThe great news is that learning and seeing these horrors redoubled my intention to never, ever let things get so bad that I’d become like one of those gruesome images. In fact, any lingering fear of dentists evaporated into respect. I go to the George Brown Wave Clinic for annual cleanings now, and in the process, ironically or not, I’ve even learned a lot about dental hygiene. I even became an exhibit myself once – I still have my wisdoms, making for a full set of teeth. One student hygienists described me as the weirdest patient they’d ever had, but she brought out a tray of dental tools and challenged me to identify the various weapons of oral warfare - I guess that’s a plus. I find it curious that the periodontal probe they use has a black-and-yellow waspy look – that shit terrifies me.\n\nI’m also deathly afraid of museums.\n","title":"[NF] A Trip To the Dentist"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about amateur dental work?","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator reads about amateur dentists who take great pride in their work.

He had a look of anticipation, as if he was waiting for some pain relieving gossip. \n\n“I was home,” I responded innocently before he rolled his eyes at me. “Now, don’t bother me, I’m trying to focus.” Although normally I would use anything to distract me from school, I wasn’t about to involve Max in last night’s mess.\n\n“Are you expecting me to believe you weren’t at Nina’s party?” He raised his eyebrows at me. I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me. Perhaps I couldn’t fix her parent’s divorce, but I could at least attend her house party. Especially after her break up with Todd, the leather jacket douche that called her “babe” so much I would wonder if he knew her real name.\n\n“I promise you’ll have a great time,” Nina had told me. And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle. Something nostalgic about repetitive rap songs preaching about the wonders of big asses. \n\nEverything seemed normal at first. The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room. I could feel the air thickening. \n\nMinutes before terror, I was standing unnoticed next to a group of girls I recognized. \n\n“Someone told me her dad was abusive,” I heard one say with wide eyes. \n\n“Yeah, apparently the neighbors called the cops on them,” another responded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t point fingers just yet. Nina’s mom’s a bitch. Maybe she deserved it,” a brunette shrugged and took a sip of her drink right before our eyes met. Her face flared red as she realized her words had been overhead. I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry. A millisecond later, I spotted Nina on the floor. Hands covering her face in defense. The lack of light in the room didn’t stop the fierceness of her blood as it dripped down her temple and into her hair. \n\nI stood still. My brain called in fear but my body made no response. Not even when Todd walked passed me, into the hallway and shut the door behind him. \n\nNina remained on the floor. She held herself and rocked back and forth, letting silent cries out into the thick air. \n\n“Don’t tell anyone.” She whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” Max snapped at me. “Are you going to tell me or not?” I stared at him blankly as the vivid flashbacks flew through my head. My heart stung in bitterness as I recognized that all I wanted to do was say it. To write it out in sharpie on all student lockers.\n\nNina’s bloody face burned in my head. “There’s nothing to tell.”","title":"[RF] Last Night Leftovers"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the passage say about Todd?","answers":[{"answer":"Todd is Nina's ex-boyfriend.

They all dressed in the finest suits and each had an air of self-entitlement. The room was barren except for a large oak wood table the stood elegantly in the center. Chairs circled the table and a few had been knocked over when the men had stood up to yell. The room was well lit with a large window that nearly took up an entire wall. The large window provided the room with natural light so there were no lights in the room. There were three doors in the room, two of them led to a different tower of the hotel. The third was a large decorative door with intricate gold plated designs carved in the door. This conference room was on the last floor of the hotel before the hotel split into two different towers. The hotel itself was a large hotel in Chicago, one of the best. Known for its extreme luxury and quality service, many major corporations and business meetings of the extremely wealthy were held here because of its top-notch service. The room was painted a light yellow with a mirror that hung over a fireplace. There were old paintings from the 1600’s that covered the walls and gave the room an elegant museum-like feel. \n\tThe men were in the middle of yelling when the large door swung open and the room went quite. The men who weren’t already standing quickly stood up a man walked slowly towards the head of the table. The man stood at the head of the table, looking around the room at who was presented before him. \n“Take a seat.” The man said and the men in front of him quickly sat down again. “I would like to introduce myself. My name is Anthony Kane.” \n\tThe alarm went off on the clock and the rooms lights dimmed on. Stephen sat up and turned off his alarm clock. He sat upright on his bed for a minute with his hair disheveled before he swung his legs out from under the comforters and put his feet in his slippers. His apartment was in downtown Chicago on the top floor penthouse. His blinds opened automatically every morning to wake him up. His room was very spacious and modernly designed with grey walls and white carpet. On the wall opposite his bed there was a walk in closet that he used to keep his expensive suits. As he stood up and walked out of the room, he picked up the robe that was lying on the armchair by the door. He walked down the corridor into the kitchen. He cooked and left food for his wife and kids to have when they woke up.\nStephen’s phone rang as he took the elevator down. He didn’t recognize the number and when he picked up, he didn’t recognize the voice. The caller told him to go to a very important meeting that was taking place at one of the nicest hotels in the area. The caller assured him that it was just a regular business meeting. The caller then told Stephen a serious of numbers that he scribbled on a post it. He was confused on what the meeting was about and when he asked any of his coworkers at the firm he worked at what the meeting was, none of them knew. \n\tStephen showed at the hotel at exactly 2 pm just like that caller had said. He went to the front desk and told the receptionist the series of numbers.\n“Follow me,” the receptionist walked around the counter and went to the elevator. They took the elevator up to the 5th floor. “This is as far as I can go. Go down the hall, take a right and go into the room at the end.” The receptionist closed the elevator door and left him alone in the corridor. \n\tIn the room, people were already seated around the large table and were quiet. As he picked the only empty seat in the room, he realized he didn’t recognize a single person in the room. The people in the room were all men with really expensive, luxurious suits. Everyone in the room looked extremely wealthy. They sat quietly and after a few minutes of silence people started to talk and soon people were arguing about baseball. They argued and stood up and yelled at each other. The yelling ceased when the large doors swung open. A man walked in slowly and stood at the head of the table. He looked around the room at all the faces and people. The man wore a black suit with a gold tie. He had numerous large, extravagant rings on his fingers. \n“I would like to introduce myself.

I was wrapped from the waist down in the white sheets of a bed. I felt like a twig. I looked at the smiling doc. My vision was surprisingly clear. Beyond the doc, the room boasted blue curtains, white walls and bright lights - as one should expect, I assume at least, from a hospital room.   \n\nThe doc sported black hair, two lovely pearly earrings and a pair of eyes. I smiled back. I was definitely on something. I can’t tell what, but my mouth crinkles seemed to buzz as muscles contracted. It was a weird feeling. My mind wondered easily. Almost as easily as my eyes. I remember looking at the wall clock and following the ticking motion of the hands. At the time, they had a nice movement to them. I likened that motion to the sway of smoke or the flapping of a flame.\n\nI was told by the lovely doc to embrace my new heart in a language comprised of factoids and the occasional medical vignette. \n\n“It’s a technologically sound device and very new indeed”.\n\n“135 beats per minute and far more efficient than the real thing. Breath taking, really”. \n\nAfter the doc’s description about how terrific my new heart is, I had a little coughing fit. I can only put the cough down to the dustiness of the room’s air. The odd thing was that my heart rate stayed exactly the same. Now, not having experienced this before, I must say it is a feeling of peculiarity. It was at this moment that I realised my case was quite luxurious. I would never have to worry again about becoming light headed from lying down too long and nor would I have to worry about attending anymore of Minnie’s god awful Pilates classes. A minor miracle. \n\nI remember having a little lapse form my bliss. How would Minnie respond? And the kids? Joseph had only just managed to graduate and, well, Kayla’s kids now have to deal with an even less capable Gramps. Fantastic. Thinking about all this was all fine and dandy, but I soon realised that the most pressing issue was to work out how I was going to navigate Minnie’s “I told you so” moment.\n\n“Listen to me, you’re too old for this”.\n\n“40 years. It’s going to kill you”. \n\nMinnie’s concerns are always the same. I never take them to heart. I know she means well. But, my god, that woman can complain and she now had a fair point. I looked back at the doctor still mumbling away. I concluded apologising was the best bet. I needed to play the victim card to my advantage. Minnie isn’t that heartless. She’s come around. \n\nI tuned back to the doc. I was told that there are two battery packs built into my chest. All externally rechargeable, of course. When one pack dies out, the second pack kicks in and it becomes paramount that the previous one is recharged. If I fail this procedure, I die; with both battery packs empty there is simply nothing to power the circulation of my blood, to transport my oxygen and to keep me alive. \n\nThe doctor smiled again. I must say, by now, I remember beginning to feel a little restless. I was starting to come around. My eyes darted down towards the doctor’s blouse, to the chest pocket of her white coat and then to the little white pen that popped out. \n\nIt was then that I realised I now had no heart and all I really wanted was a cigarette.

He received his first commissions during study trips to Rome and the Veneto.\n\nIn 1797, during a stay in Bologna, he moved in political circles close to the ideas of the French Revolution. Salucci thereby aroused the mistrust of the government of the Habsburg Grand Duchy of Tuscany and was sentenced to death in absentia in 1798. Thereupon he joined the French Italian Army.\n\nIn 1801 he was employed as topographer for the Cisalpine Republic, a daughter republic under Napoleon in northern Italy, and in 1802 he worked on the fortifications of Alessandria, Mantua, and Verona.\n\nAfterwards he took part in the French invasion of Russia. He survived and managed to escape to Danzig. After the Battle of Waterloo he fell into English captivity, from which he was released in 1816.\n\nAfter his release, he initially worked for the Geneva banker Jean Gabriel Eynard, from whom he received a recommendation for King Wilhelm I of Württemberg. The latter appointed him court architect in 1818.\n\nIn Württemberg, the Royal Pavilion in Weil near Esslingen was initially built in collaboration with the Queen Catherine of Württemberg, who was a passionate lover of architecture. In 1819, after her death, he built her Württemberg Mausoleum. From 1823 to 1829 the Schloss Rosenstein was built according to the plans of Salucci. Other buildings designed by him are the Wilhelmspalais and the Alte Reithalle (royal riding hall), both in Stuttgart.\n\nSince the planned costs for the Royal Pavilion in Weil were exceeded, he soon had to have everything approved by the Building and Garden Directorate. In 1828, after a dispute with a superior, he applied for his dismissal. Four days later, however, he asked to be reinstated. In 1839 dry rot was discovered in Rosenstein Castle, for which Salucci was made responsible; this led to his final dismissal.\n\nIn 1840 Salucci returned to Florence almost penniless. He died there in 1845 and was buried in the cloister of the St Mark’s, Florence.\n\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Esslingen am Neckar Weil Koeniglicher Pavillon.jpg|Royal pavilion in Esslingen-Weil File:S-wilhelmspalais.jpg|Wilhelmspalais at Charlottenplatz in Stuttgart File:Schloss Rosenstein südwestliche Hauptfassade.jpg|Castle Rosenstein in Stuttgart File:Grabkapelle Württemberg Eingang (2009).jpg|Württemberg Mausoleum in Stuttgart\n\n\nWorks in Public Collections\n\n-   Salucci's estate, consisting of 142 drafts of buildings, is located in the Stuttgart University Library (Inv.

Black Dog Syndrome is the name shelter workers have given to the tendency of dark-furred pups to languish in kennels while their lighter-furred brethren get adopted. “The effect is very real,” says Mirah Horowitz, executive director and founder of Lucky Dog Animal Rescue. “We recently had a litter of five very cute, very fluffy puppies, two yellow and three black. And the yellow ones all went immediately, but for the black ones it took weeks.”\n\nBlack dogs get euthanized at higher rates. They linger at pounds and adoption agencies for longer than light-colored dogs, and they are less likely to find a home. Marika Bell, director of behavior and rehoming for the Humane Society of Washington, D.C., says the organization has been tracking animals that have stayed at their shelters the longest since March 2013. They found that three characteristics put a pet at risk of becoming one of these so-called “hidden gems”: medium size, an age of 2-3 years, and an ebony coat.\n\nWhat kind of nefarious psychological quirk would prevent someone from adopting a dog based on fur color?\n\nAnimal welfare experts believe the discrimination arises from a pack of factors. The mythology around black dogs is grim. (The Grim, from _Harry Potter_, is a “large, black, spectral dog that haunts churchyards” and augurs death.) A 2013 study by Penn State psychologists revealed that people find images of black dogs scarier than photos of yellow or brown dogs—respondents rated the dark-furred animals less adoptable, less friendly, and more intimidating. And while the association between obsidian and evil is more explicit for cats, dogs have to contend with a culture, post-Samuel Johnson and Winston Churchill, that symbolizes depression as a coal-colored hound.\n\nIt’s not all superstition, though. With the ascent of image-based sites like Petfinder and Petango, much of the adoption process takes place before you even arrive at the shelter. And glamour shots of black animals are harder to imbue with the requisite sparkle. “Their faces look less expressive, and their eyes get lost,” says Fred Levy, a photographer whose Black Dog Projectattempts to give jet-hued canines the star treatment they deserve. (Photography lighting problems can also drive fashion glossies to subtle racism.) Because of the way the camera averages out exposure levels over the entire scene, Levy explains, “often all you’ll see of the dog is a black silhouette and a big tongue.” He solves the problem by arranging his models against a charcoal background. And Horowitz has found that videos work better than photographs at capturing a dog’s lovable personality. But for adoption programs without video equipment or access to professional photographers, shots of black animals remain harder to sell than those of lighter-colored pets.\n\nThe drama of the black dog doesn’t get much easier once you arrive at the shelter. While bright white and yellow pooches catch people’s eye, Horowitz tells me, darker-haired pups tend to get lost in a crate’s shadows. (For this reason, some rescue organizations now train inky dogs to sit in front of their kennels during visiting hours.) And though black may not actually be the most common canine color, says Bell, it is sometimes perceived as such, which means prospective owners looking to stand out from the crowd will sometimes DQ a black dog.\n\nBell has her own pet theory: “I think it comes down to facial expressions,” she tells me. “People attach to dogs when they can read their facial expressions, and on black dogs those are harder to make out. You can barely see their eyebrows, and it becomes harder to humanize them and connect on an emotional level.”\n\nOther hypotheses floating around the trade: Would-be owners worry that a black dog will shed too noticeably on the furniture; black dogs get overheated more easily at adoption events and don’t introduce themselves; black dogs look older; black dogs strike people as boring. And one chow jowl-wrinkle that no one mentions: Studies suggest that people tend to choose pooches that bear some resemblance to them, whether that manifests in a lady with flowing tresses selecting a long-eared retriever or a saggy-faced man opting for a bulldog. Could the link between an owner’s and a dog’s appearance factor into the phenomenon? According to a Pew survey, 45 percent of white people own a dog, compared to 20 percent of black people. (Looking at presidential pets, Bo Obama is black, but then so was George W. Bush’s Miss Beazley.)\n\nSome dismiss Black Dog Syndrome as an urban legend, noting a paucity of hard data supporting the effect. As a measure of how common raven-haired pups are, the Los Angeles Animal Services Department reported in 2008 that 27 percent of the 30,046 dogs it had picked up in the previous 12 months had predominantly sable coats. That prevalence was mirrored in the year’s adoption statistics: 28 percent of the animals that eventually found homes were also predominantly black. And in a 2012 study, researchers asked volunteers to rank four hypothetical pooches—a big white poodle, a small white poodle, a big black poodle, and a small black poodle—on perceived friendliness and aggressiveness. They discovered that the imaginary white dogs were seen as significantly meaner and more combative than the imaginary black ones, perhaps due to stereotypes about yappy white lap-dog terrors. (Do we subconsciously transfer Paris Hilton’s character traits to the pampered pale teacups she favors?) In any case, the study raised questions about whether what spooks us about black pups is their color or the association between dark fur and several of dogdom’s more reputedly vicious breeds: Rottweilers, Dobermans, and some pit bull mixes.\n\n“There are lots of compounding factors,” Julie Morris, the senior vice president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, told _ABC_. “Are there just more black dogs in shelters, or is the real problem because most black dogs are also big dogs?” (The prevailing wisdom goes that big dogs have a harder time finding homes, perhaps because they seem less manageable. As the Washington Humane Society data suggests, though, it may be medium dogs that scrape together the worst of both worlds: not tiny enough to fit in a purse, not huge enough to be a sexy statement.)\n\nWhatever the precise mix of bias and bad luck, some white knights are riding to black dogs’ defense. Many shelters have discounts on dark-furred animals, and D.C.’s Lucky Dog Animal Rescue recently held a Back in Black Fashion Show, in which a select group of eight adoptable pooches flaunted their ebony coats. (Tagline: “Adopt in glimmering black!”) There are photography Tumblrs and online rescue projects dedicated to the plight of the canine noir. There are tip sheets on how to “bedazzle your black dog.” (“Sew sequins or appliques on bandanas for the dogs to wear.”) There are black pet adoption GIFs. Even Emmylou Harris has joined the cause.\n\n “It’s just so irrational that people would think the color of a dog’s fur has anything to do with its character,” says Levy, the photographer.\n\n“The effect is baffling,” says Bell. “I just want to tell people sometimes, ‘This is an amazing dog. You’ve got to look at this dog.’ ”\n\nSo, prospective pet owners, consider the gauntlet thrown. Black dogs need your yelp (help). Society needs all of our heightened awareness. We have come too far in combatting bias and ignorance to keep penalizing animals for the color of their fur.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about dark pets?

Two men were talking to each other and *he* didn't see their faces. *He* saw moving lips. The stench of the apartment did not bother *him*. Half eaten food rotted on the floor. The most recent of this food was a bowl of somewhat eaten jello. It sat still on the table next to the couch where a mindless *man* sat. \n\nWho is this man? Most would say he's a brilliant writer of a dozen famous short stories; each translated into a dozen languages and read by much more than a dozen people.

This writer is a genius. \n\nBut at this moment, he isn't a famous writer. He is Alfred Jones, the newest of his characters. You see, when the writer writes, he locks himself in his apartment for many months. He eats, but he doesn't finish. He turns on the TV and enters his imagination, unaware of reality, to build his characters for hours. He writes it all down when he awakes at midnight. He becomes his characters during these trances. \n\nHe jolted wide awake. *Is it midnight?* He checked the time through a TV and found it was 9:00. Two men were talking on a screen. *Who are these two men, Sally?* He looked around. Sally was not there. *This isn't my place. Did I get drunk today? No, I couldn't have.

Screams echoed in a bathroom. This isn't him! This isn't him! *WHO IS THIS FACE?! WHO IS THIS?!* He screamed and screamed. He clawed at the face. *Is it a mask?* He pulled but it wouldn't come off. *Stink jello stink.* The man smashed the face into a mirror. He's just dreaming right now! *This can't be real.* Blood trickled down the mangled face. Shards of mirror were dug into skin. They were deep. \n\n*Where's your wallet?* I don't know. \n\n*Go find it.* Who are you?\n\nThe man walked of a bathroom. Blood dripped onto a floor. *Why is my face on fire?* The man went towards a room. My face hurts. Sally? *Help me. Jello stink.* \n\nI opened a door.

Described as “one of the most entertaining of men, very clever at epigram and repartee, and famous for quaint sayings. His life had been adventurous and, from a domestic point of view, somewhat of a stormy nature.”[1]\n\n\nEarly life\n\nYznaga was born in New York on October 16, 1850. He was the oldest of four children, and only son, born to merchant diplomat Antonio Modesto Yznaga del Valle (1823–1892) and Ellen Maria (née Clements) Yznaga (1833–1908).[2] His father was from an old Cuban family who owned a large plantation (Torre Iznaga)[3] and sugar mills in the vicinity of Trinidad, Cuba; they had connections to several Spanish aristocratic families.[4] In addition to plantations in Cuba and Louisiana, his parents owned properties in New York City and Newport, Rhode Island. Among his siblings was Consuelo Yznaga (who married George Montagu, 8th Duke of Manchester in 1876)[5] Naticia Yznaga (who married Sir John Lister-Kaye, 3rd Baronet in 1881),[6] and Emily Yznaga (who never married).[7][8]\n\nHis maternal grandfather, Samuel Clements, was a steamboat captain who owned Ravenswood Place, a plantation in Concordia Parish, Louisiana, which his mother inherited upon their death.[9] Through his sister Consuelo, he was uncle to William Montagu, 9th Duke of Manchester and two nieces, known as May and Nell, who both died of consumption before marrying.[10] He was with his sister in Davos when her youngest daughter, Lady Alice (Nell), died. Reportedly, he “never seemed a very strong man since then,” and it was said that “his constitution had never recovered from the long, nervous strain which he went through at that time.”[11]\n\nHe was graduated from the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard,[12] before returning south and earning an LL.D. degree from Louisiana Law School while at his families plantation near Lake Concordia in Louisiana, where they were all well known in New Orleans society.[13]\n\n\nCareer\n\nAfter his eldest sister's marriage to the Duke of Manchester, he came to New York City.[14] After his first marriage to a sister-in-law of William Kissam Vanderbilt, he was reportedly gifted a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and entered the firm of H. B. Hollins & Co. at 15 Wall Street, a close friend of Vanderbilt's and J. Pierpont Morgan. Yznaga was “an excelled businessman” and made his fortune at the firm, working there for twenty years until his death in 1901.[15] The firm, which was organized in 1878, went bankrupt on November 13, 1913.[16]\n\nEven after his divorce from Jennie, he remained close friends with Vanderbilt and was frequently aboard his yacht, the _Valiant_. Yznaga, Vanderbilt and Winfield Hoyt were referred to as the “Three Vanderbilt Musketeers” as they were always seen together.[17] He was a member of the Union Club, the Tuxedo Club, the County Club, the Manhattan Club, the Athletic Club, the Meadow Brook Hunt Club, and one of the original members of the Metropolitan Club in 1891, where he lived.[18][19]\n\n\nPersonal life\n\n[Mrs. Fernando Yznaga, née Miss Mabel Wright, of New York, .] On September 22, 1880, Yznaga was married to Mobile, Alabama born Mary Virginia “Jennie” Smith (1856–1926), sister of Alva (née Smith) Vanderbilt at the Vanderbilt home in Oakdale on Long Island.[20] They were daughters of Murray Forbes Smith, a commission merchant, and Phoebe Ann (née Desha) Smith (daughter of US Representative Robert Desha).[21] After their divorce in 1886, Jennie remarried to William George Tiffany of Baltimore (a nephew of Mrs. August Belmont and first cousin of Charles Lewis Tiffany)[22] in 1888 and moved to Maisons-Laffitte near Paris (before their eventual divorce in 1903).[23][24]\n\nFernando's engagement to Mabel Elizabeth Wright (1869–1926)[25] was announced in what was described as an astonishment to society. At the time, she was living with her father, a designer of carpets for Higgins Mills, in a boarding house and “her face was her fortune.” The wedding took place a week later on March 4, 1890 at the boarding house and they set sail for Europe the following day. Upon their return, they lived in New York and at Tuxedo Park. Mabel later went to South Dakota where she divorced Fernando in 1895 and,[26] soon after, married the Hungarian Count Bela Zichy (nephew of Mihály Zichy) and became the mother of Count Theodore Zichy.[27] There were rumors of his engagement to be married a third time, including to Constance Biddle a few weeks before his death, but they were all denied.\n\nYznaga died of diphtheria at the Minturn Hospital in New York City on March 6, 1901.[28] After a funeral at the Little Church Around The Corner, he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx.[29] Upon his death, his estate worth about $2,000,000,[30] was left primarily to his sister, then the Dowager Duchess of Manchester.[31]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] Patterson, Jerry E. _The Vanderbilts._, pages 120-121.

Her novels are: _Slow Dancing, The Beginner’s Book of Dreams, Safe Conduct, Almost_, and _The Practice of Deceit_. She lives in New York City and works as a college admissions consultant.[1][2][3][4][5]\n\n\nWork\n\nFiction\n\nHer first published short story, “Feasting,” was selected for the 1983 O. Henry Prize Short Story collection.[6] Her second story, “A Fifty Percent Chance,” published in _Seventeen_ magazine in 1982, earned a National Magazine Award.[7] Her first novel, _Slow Dancing_ (Alfred A. Knopf), was a finalist for the 1985 National Book Award[8] and the _LA Times_ Fiction Prize.[9] Her novel _Almost_, a _New York Times_ Notable Book of the Year, was selected as one of _Newsweek_{{'}}s Best Fiction of 2001.\n\nNonfiction\n\nBenedict's _Joy of Writing Sex: A Guide for Fiction Writers_ (Story Press) was first published in 1996. A second edition, published in 2002, was updated to include the new role of the Internet and the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal in writing about sex in fiction The book was also published in the U.K., Germany and Australia[10][11][12][13]\n\nBenedict teaches workshops on writing about sex in fiction at writers’ conferences and has appeared on radio shows discussing the issue in the U.S., UK, and Australia.[14][15][16]\n\n_The Joy of Writing Sex_ led the _New York Observer_ to include Benedict on its panel on the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, described in Francine Prose’s article, “New York Supergals Love That Naughty Prez” Benedict defended then-President Clinton's conduct, saying “Nobody is aggrieved here. Monica's not complaining, Hillary's not complaining. The only person who cares is Ken Starr.”[17][18][19] Benedict reaffirmed her defense of Clinton in a retrospective of the scandal on the _Slate_ podcast “Slow Burn,” in 2018.[20]\n\nBenedict's book reviews, personal essays, and articles have appeared in _The New York Times_, _Los Angeles Times_, _Boston Globe_, _Salmagundi_, _Tin House_, _Daedalus_, _Harper's Bazaar_, _Esquire_, _Real Simple_, _Allure_, _The American Prospect_, and _The Rumpus_. Her short fiction has appeared in _Narrative Magazine_.[21]\n\nAnthologies\n\nBenedict is the editor of three anthologies. The first, _Mentors, Muses and Monsters: 30 Writers on the People who Changed Their Lives_ (2009, Free Press, Simon & Schuster), was inspired by an essay she wrote for _Tin House_ about her mentor at Barnard, Elizabeth Hardwick.[22] It includes essays by other Barnard alumnae Mary Gordon and Sigrid Nunez. Nunez's essay on Susan Sontag was the inspiration for her 2011 memoir about Sontag, _Sempre Susan_.[23]\n\nHer second anthology, _What My Mother Gave Me: Thirty-one Women on the Gifts that Mattered Most_ (2013 Algonquin Books), was a _New York Times_ Bestseller.[24] Her third, _Me, My Hair and I: Twenty-seven Women Untangle an Obsession_ (2015, Algonquin Books) includes essays by Maria Hinojosa, Marita Golden, and Jane Smiley.\n\nThemes\n\nGrowing up in New York City has been a noted theme of Benedict's fiction and nonfiction. About her second novel, _The Beginner's Book of Dreams_, _Kirkus Reviews_ wrote: “Benedict handles Manhattan life, in this case a young girl's exploration of semi-fraudulent Manhattan life, superbly—with the vibrancy of The World of Henry Orient (that underappreciated book by Nora Johnson) or with the emotional dislocations of the better work of John O'Hara and Richard Yates.”[25][Benedict at the 2019 Islander's Write Festival in Marthas Vineyard]\n\nBenedict's personal essay, “Murder One: Mad Dog Taborsky and Me” was published in _Daedalus_ in 2008[26] and explored the effect of the murder of her mother's brother on her parents’ marriage and her own life. In 1960, Joseph \"Mad Dog\" Taborsky was the last man executed in the state of Connecticut until 2005, after being released from death row for the murder of Benedict's uncle. Once released, he committed a series of murders that terrorized central Connecticut in 1956 and 1957.\n\nCollege essay coaching and teaching\n\nBenedict is the founder and president of Don't Sweat the Essay, Inc., which focuses on coaching students for college and graduate school application essays.

The border then turns east, following a straight line for 32 km (20 m), before another straight line veers to the south-east for 26 km (16 m), terminating at the coast by the junction of the Khawr Abd Allah and Khor as Subiyah opposite Hajjam Island.\n\n\nHistory\n\nHistorically there was no clearly defined boundary in this part of the Arabian peninsula; at the start of the 20th century the Ottoman Empire controlled what is now Iraq and Britain controlled Kuwait as a protectorate.[2] Britain and the Ottoman Empire theoretically divided their realms of influence via the so-called 'Blue' and 'Violet lines' in 1913-14, by which the Ottomans recognised British claims on Kuwait, divided from Ottoman Mesopotamia along the Wadi Al-Batin (the so-called 'green line', _see map right_).[3][4][5]\n\n[Map with red circle and green circle boundaries according to the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913] During the First World War an Arab Revolt, supported by Britain, succeeded in removing the Ottomans from most of the Middle East. As a result of the secret 1916 Anglo-French Sykes-Picot Agreement Britain gained control of the Ottoman Vilayets of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra, which it organised into the mandate of Iraq in 1920.[6] In 1932, the year that Iraq gained independence, Britain confirmed that the border between Iraq and Kuwait would run along the Wadi Al-Batin, as well as confirming that Bubiyan and Warbah islands were Kuwaiti territoriality, though the precise positioning of the northern straight line segments near Safwan remained imprecise.[7]\n\nKuwait gained independence in 1962, though Iraq initially refused to recognise the country claiming it as part of Iraq, later backing down following a show of force by Britain and the Arab League in support of Kuwait.[8][9][10] A treaty of friendship was signed in 1963 by which Iraq recognised the 1932 border.[11] Despite this, over the ensuing decade Iraq often raised the issue of sea access and the traditional claim to Kuwait, most notably in 1973 with the 1973 Samita border skirmish.\n\nIn 1990 Iraq invaded and annexed Kuwait, precipitating the Gulf War by which Kuwait's sovereignty was restored.[12][13] In July 1992 the matter of border demarcation was referred to the United Nations, which accurately mapped the boundary and then demarcated it on the ground, following the 1932 line with some small adjustments.[14] The border was accepted by Kuwait but not Iraq.[15] The United Nations Iraq–Kuwait Observation Mission monitored the border during the period 1991-2003. Relations between the two states have improved since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.\n\nBarrier\n\nThe IRAQ–KUWAIT BARRIER ( _Hudud al-'Irāq-al-Kuwayt_) is a border fence extending into Iraq, into Kuwait, and across the full length of their mutual border from Saudi Arabia to the Persian Gulf. Constructed by authorisation of the United Nations Security Council, its stated purpose was to stop a re-invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.\n\nThe border barrier, made of electrified fencing and concertina wire, is braced by a and trench, complete with a dirt berm and guarded by hundreds of soldiers, several patrol boats, and helicopters. Construction of the barrier began in 1991.\n\nIn January 2004, Kuwait decided to install a new iron barrier along the border. The barrier was estimated to have cost $28 million and the entire length of the border; asphalted roads were be also constructed to facilitate border security movement.[16]\n\n\nSettlements near the border\n\nIraq\n\n-   Safwan\n-   Umm Qasr\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] Briton Cooper Busch, _Britain and the Persian Gulf, 1894-1914_ (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967), 308, and 319.\n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] Helene von Bismarck, “The Kuwait Crisis of 1961 and its Consequences for Great Britain’s Persian Gulf Policy”, in _British Scholar_, vol.

I feel a searing hot rod force its way into the back of my skull. I can’t stop screaming, and that attracts the rest of the men.\n\tI have no choice but to obey. I come out of the closet quietly while they tie me up.  I try to remain calm, but I falter as the boss begins to talk. “Guess what Sabrina? I woke up today and I found all my drugs and money gone. You’re the last person I’ve sold to in days. What did you do with them?\n\tI have no idea what he’s talking about. He’s probably high right now. But then I suddenly remember something. The razor blade on my bed. At the current moment they have me tied up, lying face down on the floor. I look up at him and use my most innocent voice. “I didn’t do it, but I know who did. But right now I’m a little uncomfortable. You can keep me tied up, but please let me lie down on the bed. “\n\t“Why should I care if you’re comfortable or not?”\n“Because otherwise I’m going to say a thing.”\n\t“I guess I’ll just have to beat it outta ya.”\nI smile a cocky grin. “You already poked out one of my eyes and I haven’t said anything yet.” I hear him curse under his breath as he throws me onto the bed.  Within seconds I find the razor blade and start to cut at the rope that imprisons me. I’m done quickly and he doesn’t even notice. \n\t“Quite stalling and tell me something already.”\n“Oh, I’ll tell you something.”\n\t“what’s that?”\n“you’re going to die.”\nI throw my razor, quick and sleek, and watch as his red crimson spills out. His goonies have seen enough, and bolt for the door.  They think they’re going to get away, but they’re not. I grab the two closest things on the end table next to my bed, a pen and a vase. I sprint out my door and quickly catch them in the parking garage. The first assailant makes the mistake of turning around to look at me, and I smash the vase into his face, sending a million shards of glass into his eyes, flesh, and even mouth. I grab a piece before it hits the ground and I kill him like I did his boss, by slicing his throat. This whole time his buddy has just been standing there, watching me kill him. Once his friend is done it’s only me and him, and he has my full attention. I take my pen and jab it into his right eye, just like the one that got damaged on my own face less than five minutes ago. I quickly pluck the pen back out and sink it into his heart, and let his body drop. I don’t care about the mess, let the staff clean it up.\n","title":"I just thought this up. it's my first story.

She writes that DeVos was the \"number one driver for cancellation.\"\n\n\"This disgraced former White House employee is peddling lies for profit. The book is a joke as are the false claims she’s making about Secretary DeVos,\" said Liz Hill, press secretary to DeVos.\n\nThe White House has pushed back strongly against the book, and the president has labeled Manigault Newman \"wacky,\" \"deranged\" and a \"dog\" in posts to his Twitter account this week. Trump's presidential campaign has also filed for arbitration proceedings against her.\n\nThe Trump administration — and DeVos in particular — have had a rocky relationship with black colleges. DeVos famously issued a statement equating the history of the schools — founded during an era of racial segregation — to “school choice” policies. She later apologized.\n\nManigault Newman, an HBCU graduate who spearheaded the Trump administration's outreach to those schools, was herself a polarizing figure in that role.\n\nBut she says in her book that she was the one who drove Trump to sign a much-ballyhooed executive order designed to woo the schools. That order said his administration would move an initiative aimed at boosting HBCUs from the Education Department to the White House — a move that many college leaders had hoped would give them a direct line to the president.\n\nManigault Newman writes that she tried to forge a relationship with DeVos — though she said she sat near DeVos in Cabinet meetings and determined \"there is no way she should be the secretary of education\" — because Manigault Newman \"was on a mission for increased education funding for HBCUs and wasn't ready to give up on involving the secretary of education in the pursuit.\"\n\nShe traveled with DeVos to Daytona Beach, Florida, for the Bethune-Cookman commencement address, despite writing that it was clear \"[no] one wanted DeVos to speak at their school, and her visits were written off as photo ops only.\"\n\nThe trip did not go well, in Manigault Newman's telling.\n\n\"Betsy got up onstage to give her speech and was immediately, loudly booed by the entire audience,\" Manigault Newman writes. \"Graduating students and their families stood up and turned their backs on her. I was seated onstage watching this travesty unfold. When the booing started, she should have wrapped it up, but she went on and on for twenty minutes, talking over the booing. I was thinking, _It’s not about you! Abandon your full speech! Adjust, woman!_\" Manigault Newman described it as \"painful to experience.\"\n\nAfter the speech, Manigault Newman writes that she asked DeVos how she thought it went, to which she says DeVos responded, \"I did great!\"\n\n\"I must have looked stunned,\" she writes. Then DeVos allegedly added: “They don’t get it. They don’t have the capacity to understand what we’re trying to accomplish.”\n\n\"Meaning, all those black students were too stupid to understand her agenda,\" Manigault Newman writes.\n\nManigault Newman says she told DeVos, “Oh, no, Madam Secretary. They get it. They get it, and they aren’t happy about you or your goals.”\n\nThe next day, Manigault Newman writes, she was ditched at the hotel by DeVos, who allegedly told her, \"sorry, we had to leave early. Change of plans. Take an Uber.”\n\nManigault Newman says she returned to D.C. and complained directly to Trump, who, she says, \"shook his head in disgust\" and said, “She is Ditzy DeVos, what do you expect? In a very short period of time, I will get rid of her. Believe me, believe me.”\n\nLater in the book, Manigault Newman claims that DeVos \"went to John Kelly and asked him to force me to cancel\" the annual HBCU conference, referring to Trump's chief of staff.\n\nThe administration was under pressure from college leaders and some members of Congress to delay it after Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nBut Manigault Newman writes that she was determined that it go on. She convinced Kelly to let it continue, but \"that if it failed, I would own it solely.\"\n\n\"I heard from a member of the HBCU staff that DeVos was livid that the event was moving forward,\" she writes. \"A week after my meeting with General Kelly, Betsy DeVos tried to shut down the event by sending out a blast notice that it was off, and then she canceled the contract with the conference’s hotel. By doing so, she cost the US government $75,000 in cancellation fees. She did not care!\"\n\nManigault Newman claims she turned to Trump for help and he supported her. The administration hosted a much smaller event at the White House, organized by Manigault Newman. But she claims that \"Secretary DeVos refused to give opening remarks\" at the event.\n\n\"I turned to the president again,\" Manigault Newman wrote. \"As a result, the head of Cabinet Affairs, Bill McGinley, told her she had to give the opening remarks.\"\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize Omarosa Manigault Newman's relationship with Betsy DeVos.","answers":[{"answer":"Omarosa Manigault Newman and Betsy DeVos have a rocky relationship.

Mother cat is talking to her kittens, who have just recently discovered their abilities to walk and explore, about the dangers of \"street life\" and \"pet life\".   She discusses all of the positive and negative tropes of both lives and tells her kittens they have a choice of which one they wish to live.  Unanimously all the kittens agree that street life, the life mother lived, is the one they want, accept Marko, who remains silent.  They all become quiet, including mother, in a silent stare at Marko. \n\nMarko's Unplanned Rebellion\n\nAfter the litter of kittens disperses to a shady section at the bottom of the hill, Marko makes his way, for the first time, to the top of the hill to a spot where mother cat said never to go as it is precisely the spot where a human can see them and take them.  Not heading his mothers words, he makes his way all the way up to see a vast grid of human houses.  He is in awe of the magnificence of the sight and gazes upon it, wondering what it would be like to be a pet.  He imagines all of the new things he would experience and what a human would be like.  He has seen humans before but never interacted with one.  Until he spots a little human girl in the house closest to the hill.  \n\nJust as Mother Warned  \n\nShe makes direct eye contact with him then immediately points to him, to which two other humans, much larger than she, come into view.  The largest human begins to walk towards Marko.  He does not run away.  He sits and waits for them to come to him. Marko is in awe of how big the human gets as it gets closer and closer to him.  He notices things he has never noticed before, like noses and eyeglasses.  Then, just before he can turn around to look back at his family and mother, large hands embrace his whole body and he is lifted higher then he has ever been.  The motion winds him as he tries to scream for help, but no sound comes out.  Only the sound of the human saying, \"Dont worry little guy, I wont hurt you\".  \n\nThe words mean nothing to him and he cries once more, this time letting out the loudest shriek he has ever made.  As soon as he gets his bearings inside the large human hands, he looks back to see if his mother heard him.  To his surprise, he sees a vacant hill, and with that he closes his eyes and cries out some more as the large hands place him into a dark box.\n\n\n\n\nThe Rise of A Pet\n\nWhen he opens his eyes, Marko finds himself in an unfamiliar world.  He is still inside the box which is now on the floor of a bathroom that is brightly lit by florescent lights.  All he can see is the crack at the bottom of the white door and shadows that move about from the other side.  He exits the box and looks up to find an open window with a long white curtain draping to the floor.  He immediately runs to it and begins to frantically climb until he reaches the window sill.  From this vantage point he can see the hill where he was taken, then he looks down to see a 30 foot drop onto a concrete floor.  He sees a pool and other strange objects laid out about the patio.  He looks back to the hill and now sees his mother atop the hill timidly sniffing the air.  \n\nHe lets out a loud screech, and his mothers ears perk up in his direction, but her eyes do not follow suit.  He continues screaming to no avail.  She then quickly jumps down the hill out of his sight.\n\n Marko tuns around to see the bathroom door has opened and standing in the doorway is the little girl.  She screams, \" Mommy, Mommy, Kitty is trying to escape!\" .  The child's mother then comes running into the bathroom, grabbing Marko, winding him again, and shuts the window closed.\n\n\nWho is Going To Scoop The Cat Litter?\n\n\n(work in process) \n\n\n(work in process)\n\n\n(work in process)\n\n\n(work in process)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"First Pet"},"questions":[{"question":"How does Marko's opinions change about being a pet through the story?","answers":[{"answer":"Marko is initially excited about being a pet, but when he is taken away from his mother and placed in a box, he is frightened.

Those delegates will choose the next state Democratic Party chairman, along with other party officials.\n\nSanders supporters say they hope to change the very nature of the Democratic Party.\n\n“One of the issues we’re looking to do is transform the party,” said Shannon Jackson, executive director of Our Revolution, the organization that grew out of the Sanders’s presidential campaign. “This is the first step in that process.”\n\nOur Revolution ran an on-the-ground get-out-the-vote effort to make sure supporters attended caucuses in each of the state’s 80 assembly districts. The group sent out more than 100,000 emails and delivered 40,000 text messages, Jackson told The Hill. More than 800 Sanders supporters signed up to run for delegate seats.\n\nLongtime Democratic activists, used to low-turnout caucuses in which only party regulars show up, were stunned by the long lines they faced this year. One party strategist in Sacramento said he waited 45 minutes in line before being able to vote, when he was used to walking in and out in the span of five minutes.\n\nThe surge in turnout, and Sanders backers’ success, caught the attention of elected leaders in Sacramento.\n\n“There’s a lot of energy in the party right now. We need to move really quickly to harness this energy,” state Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D) said in an interview, marveling at the turnout in his Los Angeles-area district.\n\nCalifornia’s legislature has been at the vanguard of some of the most liberal policy programs in the nation, on everything from climate change to immigrant rights. Sanders supporters hope to leverage their newfound power to convince Democratic majorities in the state Assembly and state Senate to embrace even more aggressive progressive positions.\n\n“This is to basically force the issues that we vote on onto the legislators for action. So it’s a very serious sea change,” said RoseAnn DeMoro, who heads National Nurses United and the California Nurses Association, groups that backed Sanders during his 2016 presidential primary.\n\nThe first test of the new Sanders bloc of voters will come in May, when California Democrats choose a replacement for outgoing state party Chairman John Burton.

Sanders’s group has not made an endorsement in the race, though Jackson said Our Revolution would consider weighing in.\n\nCalifornia is not the only state in which Sanders backers are trying to take over Democratic parties. The group is also organizing in Florida, Iowa, Colorado and Michigan, Jackson said.\n\n“Hopefully, within a year or two, we’ll have a majority of the states covered,” Jackson said.\n\nThe bids to seize control of state Democratic parties is reminiscent of similar moves by fans of former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas), who engineered takeovers of state Republican parties in Nevada and Arizona, among others, after Paul’s bid for president in 2012.\n\nBut Democrats find themselves in deeper minorities, both in Congress and in state legislative chambers across the country.

He had a look of anticipation, as if he was waiting for some pain relieving gossip. \n\n“I was home,” I responded innocently before he rolled his eyes at me. “Now, don’t bother me, I’m trying to focus.” Although normally I would use anything to distract me from school, I wasn’t about to involve Max in last night’s mess.\n\n“Are you expecting me to believe you weren’t at Nina’s party?” He raised his eyebrows at me. I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me. Perhaps I couldn’t fix her parent’s divorce, but I could at least attend her house party. Especially after her break up with Todd, the leather jacket douche that called her “babe” so much I would wonder if he knew her real name.\n\n“I promise you’ll have a great time,” Nina had told me. And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle. Something nostalgic about repetitive rap songs preaching about the wonders of big asses. \n\nEverything seemed normal at first. The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room. I could feel the air thickening. \n\nMinutes before terror, I was standing unnoticed next to a group of girls I recognized. \n\n“Someone told me her dad was abusive,” I heard one say with wide eyes. \n\n“Yeah, apparently the neighbors called the cops on them,” another responded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t point fingers just yet. Nina’s mom’s a bitch. Maybe she deserved it,” a brunette shrugged and took a sip of her drink right before our eyes met. Her face flared red as she realized her words had been overhead. I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry. A millisecond later, I spotted Nina on the floor. Hands covering her face in defense. The lack of light in the room didn’t stop the fierceness of her blood as it dripped down her temple and into her hair. \n\nI stood still. My brain called in fear but my body made no response. Not even when Todd walked passed me, into the hallway and shut the door behind him. \n\nNina remained on the floor. She held herself and rocked back and forth, letting silent cries out into the thick air. \n\n“Don’t tell anyone.” She whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” Max snapped at me. “Are you going to tell me or not?” I stared at him blankly as the vivid flashbacks flew through my head.

We fought together in a conflict that, one day, only we would understand. And no politician could fathom what we saw there, no civilian could've known how we bled.\n\nWe shared bullets, bottles, and blood - when we were brothers. \n\nWe were stationed with Alpha Squad. We led all the missions, he and I. I was sergeant; he was corporal. All the men in that squad were our brothers, and we were theirs. I can still remember a time when I would've taken a bat to the head for any of those guys.\n\nNow, I stand before him, and we are no longer brothers.\n\nSomehow, the politics ate him. Probably ate me, too, he'd say. But now I'm sitting in an airport in Crimea and he has a gun to my head. And if anyone bothered to look up they wouldn't have thought for a moment that we were brothers.\n\nBut we were. Once.\n\nNow he's a nationalist. Defected after the war, and found Russia to be his home, his country. I stayed with the US, and all he could say to me was how blind I'd become. After all we'd been through, as brothers, he couldn't believe I'd still take their side.\n\nBut I didn't. I just want my pension. I just want to go home. So does Alpha Squad. They're sitting next to me, but their eyes are far away. I don't bother to call to them. This isn't their business.\n\nI look up at him. The barrel is staring down my face. He's smiling.\n\n\"Once, we were brothers,\" he said.\n\n\"Still are,\" I replied, \"Only we've seen what you've seen.\"\n\n\"No,\" he lowers the pistol, \"No, that's not it at all. You viewed what I did, but you didn't see. None of you did. Or you'd be on my side.\"\n\n\"I'm on no one's side. I just want to go home,\" my voice wavers, \"I'm tired. I miss my family.\"\n\n\"We're your family,\" he raises the pistol again, \"None of those fucks at home knows what happened here.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's better they don't know,\" I turn away, toward the rest of the squad. They're all busy in their own little worlds.\n\nThe engineer specialist has a happy little grin on his face. He's remembering that time we saved those two kids after we accidentally killed their parents while we were clearing out an apartment complex. Those two kids later got blown up by a landmine. But he's not remembering that.\n\nOur sniper and spotter are talking, hushed, about what they'll do when they get home. I heard they might get married and move to South America. They want to forget what happened here. I know they never will.\n\nThe new guy is sitting, chattering his teeth. He never got used to combat, because he deployed a week before our squad was relieved from duty - two weeks before the war ended. He still has the nighttime chills from killing. He's grasping a folder in his hand - for his psychologist, when he's back stateside.\n\nThe airport is filled with people: refugees fleeing the war zone, servicemen and women going home, and children waiting for parents. No one notices us two.\n\n\"They're right. You're just a soldier,\" he puts the pistol away, \"You don't get the bigger picture. But that's okay. Some of you aren't meant to. I'll see you boys stateside - in one piece or in a casket.\" \n\n\"You're not gonna shoot me?\" I ask.\n\n\"No, because we were brothers,\" he replied.

Speaking after Dele Alli was booked for simulation in the 2-2 draw against Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday - his third such offence in as many seasons - Pochettino voiced his belief that the general mood of moral panic within the game, over what he described as “minimal details”, risks stifling football’s natural expression.\n\nPochettino also reserved harsh judgement for the use of video technology, saying that human refereeing errors were an intrinsic part of the game. Likewise, he argued that simulation on the pitch, while an offence rightly punishable under the laws of the game, was simply a sporting tactic rather than anything more sinister, insisting: “Football is about trying to trick your opponent.”\n\nThe Tottenham manager has admitted in the past that during his playing days at Newell’s Old Boys and Estudiantes, diving to win a penalty from the referee was regarded as a skill, one even practised in training. And Pochettino’s distaste for English moralising is underpinned by the fact that it was his leg over which Michael Owen dived during the 2002 World Cup, ultimately sending England through to the knockout stages at Argentina’s expense.\n\nDoubtless Pochettino will be accused in some quarters of giving divers a free pass. Yet equally, he deserves a good deal of credit for trying to convey a nuanced, intelligent sentiment in a language that is not his first. He agreed that Alli’s dive merited a booking, although he denied that Alli was beginning to develop a bad reputation amongst referees. But it was the froth and furore that followed which he found most baffling.\n\n“Look, it was a yellow card,” he said. “It happens. The referee was right. During different games, a lot of situations like this happen. The problem now is that we are so sensitive about the situation, and then we are so focused on Dele Alli. It’s too much sometimes. There is such a focus on this type of situation. I think it’s a minimal issue.\n\n“Look, there are a lot of positives from Dele. Of course, he's not perfect. Nobody is perfect. Of course, he is a clever boy. He is a little bit nasty. The problem is that, more than this type of situation, I am worried we are going to change the game that we know.”\n\nMauricio Pochettino has stressed that commentators shouldn't be overly fixated on Dele Alli's diving antics \n\n(Getty)\n\nWhereupon the discussion abruptly opened out into broader themes: into the media, into English exceptionalism, into the very essence of the game. “Football is a creative sport,” he said, “in which you need the talent that grows in a very intelligent person, a very smart brain. And now we are so focused on minimal details. I am worried that in a few years, we are pushing the sport we love now - a passionate sport that people love to watch around the world - into a very rigid structure. With VAR, with focusing too much on small actions like this.\n\nIndependent Football Newsletter\n\nGet the latest football headlines direct to your inbox twice a week\n\nIndependent Football Newsletter\n\nGet the latest football headlines direct to your inbox twice a week\n\nThe Independent would like to keep you informed about offers, events and updates by email, please tick the box if you would like to be contacted\n\nRead our full mailing list consent terms here\n\n“Football is about trying to trick your opponent - yes or no? Tactics – what does ‘tactic’ mean? When you do tactics, it is to try to trick the opponent. You play on the right, but you finish on the left. Twenty years ago, thirty years ago, we all congratulated a player when he tricks the referee like this. That is the football that I was in love with when I was a child. Yes, in Argentina, but in England too. You believe that in England you were honest and always perfect?”\n\nFinally, Pochettino argued that referees should simply be allowed to officiate and make errors unmolested by instant judgement and granular video analysis. “I am worried that maybe we are going to kill the game,” he said. “We love this game. Referees are humans too, and sometimes they are right, sometimes they are not right. In 10 months, over the whole season, sometimes it is against you, sometimes it is for you. For me, I like this type of football.\n\nThe Tottenham boss is concerned the game is being scrutinised to the point of death\n\n(Getty)\n\n“My worry is this: of course if you dive, and the referee saw you, you are punished. And he deserves it. But don’t go more crazy.”\n\nAfter a turbulent few days, Alli will probably be grateful for a night away from the spotlight, as he is set to be rested for Tottenham’s FA Cup fourth-round replay against Newport County at Wembley on Wednesday night. Pochettino said he would make several changes, with crunch games against Arsenal and Juventus coming up in the next week. Toby Alderweireld and Danny Rose could both return from injury, while Harry Winks, Fernando Llorente, Juan Foyth and Serge Aurier are all in contention for a start.\n\nNaturally, Tottenham will remain heavy favourites against their League Two opposition, who will be bringing almost 8,000 fans to Wembley from South Wales. With Newport receiving 45 per cent of gate receipts, plus television revenue, this season’s cup run could end up earning the club around £700,000 - a third of their annual budget.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize what the text says about diving/dives.

As soon as it was possible to do so, George Carville had vanished into an unobserved lift on the 50th floor of London's Shard, retreating out of the building through a discrete trade exit at the end of an underground tunnel some tens of metres away. Raising his collar, he faced the ground and walked briskly, anonymously, into the embrace of the night.\n\nHe had smoked two cigarettes and was about to leave when Nathan Cohen arrived to meet him at the centre of London Bridge. Mutely, Carville offered him his carton of cigarettes. Cohen took one, lit it and inhaled deeply before contorted his face into a scowl.\n\n\"Full strength?\" He groaned, glaring at the glowing tobacco.\n\n\"You're a grown-up now,\" Chided Carville, with a humourless voice but an imperceptibly slight smile. \"You ought to smoke like one.\"\n\n\"I ought not to smoke.\" He inhaled again before acknowledging the question that Carville had not asked. \"I apologise for my lateness. But you must remember, surely? It wasn't that long ago for you. I skimmed the reports they threw at me, I shook hands with the cloying throng. I wrote the Letters of Last Resort.\"\n\n\"How was that?\"\n\n\"The Letters? Humbling.\"\n\n\"Yes. They are.\"\n\nCohen blew smoke into the night, and looked silently at Carville for a time. \"What did you write?\"\n\n\"I can't remember specifically.\"\n\n\"That's not true.\"\n\n\"No, it isn't. But I'd rather not say. Those words have been scarred into my brain these last seven years, but that's been my burden to bear. Now you get the chance. When you're where I am, you'll know that it's best for those words to die with you.\"\n\nThey were silent for a few minutes more. A night bus trundled past, and the occasional morose traveller shuffled closely behind their backs. But the two of them took no notice, staring into the churning black river beneath them.\n\n\"You're not normally this melancholy. Although I suppose under the circumstances it's understandable.\"\n\n\"What circumstances are those?\" Carville seemed genuinely curious, and Cohen suddenly felt an abiding discomfort.\n\n\"Well, you know. The results.\"\n\n\"Best news I've had in weeks.\" \n\n\"George...\"\n\n\"I'm serious, Nat. I'm not trying to soothe any latent guilt you're storing up.\"\n\n\"I don't have any.\"\n\n\"You're too soppy not to. But it really is a relief. I'm looking forward to five years as a lightweight.\"\n\n\"Remember when we were lightweights?\" Cohen was smiling now.\n\n\"Always.\" \n\n\"It feels like so long ago.\"\n\n\"It was.\"\n\n\"Will we ever have that again? Committee hearings on absolutely nothing, constituents storming into our offices to bitch and complain about stuff we've never heard of, the stupid late-night scheming. I miss it already.\" His last sentence was spoken quietly, almost involuntarily. He thought sounded pained, or awed, or sanguine. He sounded a combination of the three.\n\n\"I intend to get all that back within a few months. You'll have to wait longer, of course.\"\n\n\"Yeah. I'm starting to wonder if I made the right choice.\"\n\n\"I'm wondering the same about the electorate.\" Carville chuckled.\n\n\"Speaking of the electorate, I think I've stolen too many minutes of my life from their claws this morning.\" \n\n\"Morning? God, it's 4:15.\"\n\n\"I need to go, George.\"\n\nCarville smiled as a jaded man would smile at a dying loved one. \"I know you do. Good luck, Nat.\"\n\nCohen's eyes were ringed with circles and heavily lidded. Taking one last survey of the skyline, he replied in a forcibly deadpan monotone. \"And to you, George. I'll see you soon.\"\n\nCohen walked quickly away with his head held low. Partly by necessity, partly to disguise the emotion that had overcome him. Carville stayed for a few minutes more alone. He reasoned that nobody would seek much from an outgoing Prime Minister until morning and that his aides would handle the press appropriately. Turning his buzzing phone off, he slouched over the rail of London Bridge as the first tinges of pink started to rise alongside the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral. He smoked, and he thought of the words he had written seven years ago to be read deep in the bowels of the ocean.\n\nAt 4:32, he abruptly stood and walked away.","title":"Concession [RF]"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about Nathan Cohen?","answers":[{"answer":"Nathan Cohen is the Prime Minister of England.

It was invented by a college dropout named Richard Drew from Minnesota who worked for a small sandpaper company founded in 1902 called Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, later known as 3M. The name \"Scotch\" itself has an origin story almost as interesting as the invention of Scotch tape.\n\nBorn Richard Gurley Drew in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1899, Drew spent a year at the University of Minnesota in the Mechanical Engineering program before dropping out. He paid for that time at school and his correspondence school course in machine design by playing banjo, and he included all of that information in his application to the open position of lab technician with 3M. He got the job and was set on the path to make history.\n\nIn the 1920s, a two-tone paint job was popular for cars and a headache for automotive painters. The two-tone look was created by painting the car one color, applying a barrier of some sort to the painted portion, and then painting the next section. In order to get around the difficulties of this type of paint job, painters and mechanics tested out different ways to achieve the look. Unfortunately, their attempts tended to be less than successful. Some automotive shops would glue newspapers over the already painted sections while others used tape to prevent paint transfer. However those techniques often left a sticky residue on the paint that was difficult to remove. Sometimes, it would even mean the painters had to do the entire paint job over again.\n\nOne of Drew's responsibilities at 3M was to deliver samples of sandpaper to local automotive shops for testing, where he often overheard workers who were painting complain about the problems with tape used for these paint jobs. The twenty-three year old then lab assistant got the idea to create a new tape that would create a seal so that the paint wouldn't get through and yet also come off clean without leaving any sticky residue that ruined the paint finish. Drew used the adhesive that 3M utilized in the construction of its sandpaper as a starting point. From there, it took him two years of experimentation with different types of adhesives that he applied to a crepe paper backing to come up with the right combination. Thus, what would be called \"Scotch\" Masking Tape was born in 1925.\n\nThe success of the Scotch Brand Masking Tape allowed Drew to move up the ranks at 3M. In 1929, his position as technical director at the fabrication laboratory allowed him to pursue another idea. Cellophane had recently been invented by DuPont and was being used by grocers and bakers as a neat way to package their groceries. However, there wasn't a good way to seal the cellophane with tape because the colored backing ruined the clear look. So Drew and his team of inventors worked to create a tape that used this clear cellophane as a backing.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission\n\nUnfortunately, the machinery that 3M used in order to apply the adhesive to the cellophane backing tore the material, and the glue that worked for the masking tape appeared amber on the clear cellophane. The team ultimately invented new clear adhesive and modified machinery to handle the cellophane. The new tape was called Scotch Brand Cellulose Tape, but it appeared that it might have missed its opportunity with grocers and bakers despite ringing endorsements from several test clients. You see, DuPont had introduced into the market a cellophane that could be sealed with heat. Nonetheless, despite missing their original target market and being released during the Great Depression, the Scotch Brand Cellulose Tape thrived with various home uses.\n\nSo this all brings us back to how the term \"Scotch\" came to be associated with 3M's Masking and Cellulose tapes. When Drew and 3M began allowing car painters to test the new Scotch Brand Masking Tape, one painter supposedly complained about the lack of adhesive on the tape. One version of the story claims that the painter asked \"Why so Scotch with the adhesive?\" Another version states that the painter said \"Take this back to your Scotch bosses and tell them to put more adhesive on it.\"\n\nWhatever the case, in the 1920s, the term \"Scotch\" was a racial slang term that meant something or someone that was cheap or stingy. Based on the feedback, Drew applied more adhesive to the tape and ultimately branded the tape with the pejorative \"stingy\" name of \"Scotch.\"\n\nIf you liked this article, you might also enjoy:\n\n-   What the Company Name \"3M\" Stands For\n-   The Invention Nobody Wanted That Became One of the Top Selling Office Products of All Time\n-   A Brief History of the Ballpoint Pen and Whether NASA Really Spent Millions Developing a Pressurized Version Instead of Just Using Pencils\n-   Super Glue was Invented by Accident, Twice\n-   Who Invented Duct Tape\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_Sarah Stone writes for the mildly popular interesting fact website_ _TodayIFoundOut.com__.

Having “Wonderboy” headline the card seems like a natural fit, and he has every intention of taking that spot as long as he’s physically capable.\n\nThompson already has an opponent in mind, too. He’s long pursued a matchup with former UFC welterweight champ Robbie Lawler (28-13 MMA, 13-7 UFC), and he hopes that fight can finally materialize.\n\n“Lawler is definitely the fight I’ve been wanting for a while,” Thompson told reporters, including MMA Junkie, at UFC on ESPN+ 6 media day. “I’ve been a big fan of him and he’s been such a monster in the welterweight division. I thought he looked great in his last fight with Ben (Askren). He looked really strong and just really focused. I think that year off gave him some time to heal up and get his mind right. I think that would be awesome.\n\n“I know there’s a card happening in Greenville, S.C., my hometown, three months from now. Hopefully come out of this fight unscathed and we’ll make that fight happen.”\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 6 takes place at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tenn. Thompson vs. Pettis headlines the card, which streams on ESPN+.\n\nThompson said he was close to booking a January showdown with Lawler. However, “Ruthless” said prior to his UFC 235 bout with Ben Askren earlier this month that the matchup was never on the table. Thompson begs to differ, but all of that is in the past, and he hopes they can make it happen in the future.\n\n“To us it was (happening),” Thompson said. “The word we were getting is it was happening. It wasn’t until the fight – I was up in New York with Chris Weidman during his fight (at UFC 230) is when I actually found out he was fighting Askren. Up until then it looked like we would fight him. I don’t know if that was UFC or his coaches, I don’t know what the whole plan was there, but for a little while there it looked like it was a for sure thing. But things happen.”\n\nThe matchup with Lawler, No. 9 in the latest USA TODAY Sports/MMA Junkie MMA welterweight rankings, has slipped through his fingers before, and No. 5-ranked Thompson said he hopes it doesn’t happen again. With Tyron Woodley no longer champion at 170 pounds, Thompson has renewed championship aspirations and thinks beating Pettis and Lawler in back-to-back fights would give him a strong case to challenge current titleholder Kamaru Usman.\n\n“I think a big win over Pettis is going to put me back in the limelight,” Thompson said. “It’s been almost 10 months since I fought and out of sight out of mind. People stop talking about you, forget about you and I just want to let everyone know that I’m still here. But a win over Lawler – he’s a former welterweight champion. He’s one of the best strikers in the division and has been in the game for a while.\n\n“It may not move me up (in the rankings), but it still shows everybody I’m here if I can do what I’m going to do Saturday and fight Lawler in my hometown and prove that, ‘Stephen is still here, let’s give him that shot again.'”\n\nFor more on UFC on ESPN+ 6, check out the UFC Rumors section of the site.\n\nBreaking, Robbie Lawler, Stephen Thompson, UFC on ESPN+ 11, UFC on ESPN+ 6, News, UFC\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about why Thompson wants to fight Lawler?","answers":[{"answer":"Thompson has been long pursuing a matchup with Lawler.

The study also provides more evidence that bisexuality is a distinct sexual orientation in women.\n\n“I was mainly interested in this topic because certain patterns seemed to be accruing in the academic literature regarding bisexual individuals, and bisexual women in particular. Bisexual women differ in some important ways––such as personality, sex drive, and relative openness to casual sex––from both their heterosexual and their lesbian counterparts,” said Scott W. Semenyna of University of Lethbridge, the corresponding author of the study.\n\n“My specific interest in the overlap between sexual orientation, Dark Triad traits (psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism), and sociosexuality sprang from two key findings. First, bisexual women report elevated sociosexuality (i.e., greater comfort with, desire for, and engagement in uncommitted sexual activity) compared to both heterosexual or lesbian women. Second, bisexual women report slightly lower levels of two personality traits––honesty/humility, and conscientiousness––than other sexual orientation groups.”\n\n“These personality traits have both been related to higher levels of Dark Triad traits, and also greater sociosexuality,” Semenyna told PsyPost. “These past findings suggest that female sexual orientation may share some unique relationships with both personality, and sexuality related variables, and I wanted to dig deeper into those potential connections.”\n\nThe researchers found that bisexual women tended to score higher on measures of sociosexuality and psychopathy than strictly heterosexual and lesbian women.\n\nThe findings were based on two surveys of a total of 1,093 female students at a Midwestern Canadian University. The study utilized the Kinsey scale of sexual attraction, which ranges from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual. In the very middle of the scale are individuals who are mostly heterosexual, equally heterosexual and homosexual, and mostly homosexual.\n\n“The big-picture take away from this study is that sociosexuality shares a curvilinear (inverted-U) relationship with female sexual orientation,” Semenyna explained. “Heterosexual and lesbian women don’t tend to differ from one another in their relative caution towards uncommitted sexual activity. Women towards the middle of the sexual orientation spectrum, especially those who are ‘moderately bisexual,’ are somewhat less cautious about uncommitted sexual activity.”\n\n“Alongside these shifts in sociosexuality are shifts in some Dark Triad personality traits, particularly psychopathy,” Semenyna told PsyPost. “These shifts are subtle, only about as large as typical sex differences in the traits, but they’re interesting. (Men typically score higher in all Dark Triad traits, as well as interest in casual sex, than do women.)”\n\n“Primarily such evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that female bisexuality and female homosexuality are the result of different developmental processes. If female bisexuality and homosexuality were simply the result of the same underlying developmental processes, one would expect that any differences between heterosexual and bisexual women in personality or interest in casual sex would be even larger when comparing heterosexual and lesbian women.”\n\n“Instead, what we observe is that lesbian and heterosexual women don’t differ in these variables, despite drastic difference in who they are sexually attracted to,” Semenyna said. “On the other hand, bisexual women are higher in these traits than heterosexual or lesbian women, while being attracted to some degree to both males and females.”\n\nThe study does have some limitations.\n\n“While research into female sexuality and women’s sexual orientation has grown in the last few decades, we are in desperate need of more data to bridge the substantial gaps in our understanding,” Semenyna remarked.\n\n“The biggest caveat in the present study is that the sexual orientation differences in psychopathy have not yet been replicated. The study adds support to other findings that bisexual women are more interested in casual sex, and engage in it more often (often with men). Other aspects of the study require replication, ideally by independent researchers.”\n\n“The other caveat is that this study was conducted on an extremely WEIRD sample (i.e., Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic). It’s unclear whether these differences apply only to university students, if similar differences may exist in the general population, or what possible cross-cultural variation exists in these patterns,” Semenyna said.\n\n“The cross-sectional nature of the study also prevents any causal connections from being drawn. First we have to establish these potential differences as reliable, then we have to interpret why these difference may exist and what they mean. In short, this study is an extremely small thread in a large tapestry that is slowly being woven, but is far from complete.”\n\nSemenyna also emphasized that the study should not be misinterpreted as an attack on bisexuality or bisexual women.\n\n“I’ve seen certain criticisms online of the study that it suggests that bisexual women are ‘slutty,’ or that we are trying to paint bisexual women in a negative light. Essentially the research is being accused of being ‘biphobic,'” he explained.\n\n“I think this is unfortunate for several reasons. The first of which is that the purpose of science is to investigate and understand, and report results regardless of how well they fit our preconceptions and preferences. Scientific investigation of sexual minorities is an important step towards greater understanding, and ultimately greater acceptance.”\n\n“The second reason is that I don’t see anything inherently wrong with people being comfortable with and pursuing casual sexual behavior, and having the freedom to do so. The sexual orientation differences in sociosexuality, as well as psychopathy, are only about as large as the typical sex differences found in these traits, with men on average scoring slightly higher than women on average,” Semenyna said.\n\n“To suggest that these differences in sociosexuality or psychopathy paint bisexual women in a negative light is to simultaneously smear men, who similarly score higher than heterosexual women on these traits. To view normal variation (i.e., diversity) in human personality and sexual behavior as somehow problematic is ultimately counterproductive to both scientific progress on these topics, and social acceptance.”\n\nThe study, “Not Straight and Not Straightforward: the Relationships Between Sexual Orientation, Sociosexuality, and Dark Triad Traits in Women“, Charlene F.

He had a look of anticipation, as if he was waiting for some pain relieving gossip. \n\n“I was home,” I responded innocently before he rolled his eyes at me. “Now, don’t bother me, I’m trying to focus.” Although normally I would use anything to distract me from school, I wasn’t about to involve Max in last night’s mess.\n\n“Are you expecting me to believe you weren’t at Nina’s party?” He raised his eyebrows at me. I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me. Perhaps I couldn’t fix her parent’s divorce, but I could at least attend her house party. Especially after her break up with Todd, the leather jacket douche that called her “babe” so much I would wonder if he knew her real name.\n\n“I promise you’ll have a great time,” Nina had told me. And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle. Something nostalgic about repetitive rap songs preaching about the wonders of big asses. \n\nEverything seemed normal at first. The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room. I could feel the air thickening. \n\nMinutes before terror, I was standing unnoticed next to a group of girls I recognized. \n\n“Someone told me her dad was abusive,” I heard one say with wide eyes. \n\n“Yeah, apparently the neighbors called the cops on them,” another responded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t point fingers just yet. Nina’s mom’s a bitch. Maybe she deserved it,” a brunette shrugged and took a sip of her drink right before our eyes met. Her face flared red as she realized her words had been overhead. I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry. A millisecond later, I spotted Nina on the floor. Hands covering her face in defense. The lack of light in the room didn’t stop the fierceness of her blood as it dripped down her temple and into her hair. \n\nI stood still. My brain called in fear but my body made no response. Not even when Todd walked passed me, into the hallway and shut the door behind him. \n\nNina remained on the floor. She held herself and rocked back and forth, letting silent cries out into the thick air. \n\n“Don’t tell anyone.” She whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” Max snapped at me. “Are you going to tell me or not?” I stared at him blankly as the vivid flashbacks flew through my head. My heart stung in bitterness as I recognized that all I wanted to do was say it.

It is a succulent, smooth annual plant with long, curved, cylindrical leaves. Its flowers have both male and female reproducing parts and its fruits are small and spherical. _Bienertia cycloptera_ grows in hot, dry climates with little rainfall and tolerates soils with high salinity levels very well. Due to its specific growing conditions, _B. cycloptera_ is not a very common, nor widespread plant. Even over most of its range, it often grows sparsely in small patches of growth. One notable aspect of _Bienertia cycloptera_ is its unique C4 photosynthesis mechanism. Unlike most C4 plants, in _B. cycloptera_ the photosynthetic mechanism occurs within a single chlorenchyma cell, without Kranz anatomy.[1][2][3]\n\n\nDistribution\n\n_Bienertia cycloptera_ is located throughout the Middle East, south-eastern Europe, and central Asia. The plant can be found in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. The range of Bienertia cycloptera throughout the Eurasian supercontinent covers an area from 24° to 49° N latitude and from 43° to 67° E longitude. It has an estimated range of 180 sq. km. in the Yerevan floristic region of Armenia, but occupies a mere 28 sq. km. of area. It fits the Deborah Rabinowitz's definition of a rare plant, even though it has a wide geographical range but low abundance where it is present.[4]\n\n\nHabitat and ecology\n\n_Bienertia cycloptera_ grows in warm climates. It grows in regions where the hottest months have a daily temperature between 20 °C and 30 °C, and annual precipitation ranges from 400mm to 76 mm. _Bienertia cycloptera_ tolerates saline and, temporarily, moist clay soils. The soils are rich in sodium ions and sulfate ions, with salinity ranging between 21 ds/m to 90 ds/m. In most habitats, _Climacoptera turcomanica_ can be found alongside _Bienertia cycloptera_.[5][6]\n\n_Bienertia cycloptera_ is an endangered species. Due to the historically saline soils of the Aarat Plain becoming more suitable for humans and therefore less saline, the _B. cycloptera_ have not been able to regrow. It falls under Category 1 of endangered species according to the Red Data Book of Armenia. Conservation efforts have been underway with a protected population in the Vordan Karmir Reservation. These efforts include monitoring the remaining populations and searching for new habitats.[7]\n\n\nMorphology\n\n[The cylindrical succulent-like leaves of the _B. cycloptera_ plants are shown.] _Bienertia cycloptera_ is characteristically a succulent, smooth, light green annual plant. It typically grows from 15 to 40 cm in length. Habitually, the plant exists in a shrub-like form. They do not have an extensive branching pattern. The leaves are long, cylindrical, and curved. They are directly connected to the stem. They extend outwards. Since many _B. cycloptera_ grow near each other, this pattern of leaves and the long stems lead to the shrub-like appearance of the plant.[8][9]\n\n\nFlowers and fruit\n\n[This shows the button-like fruits of _Bienertia cycloptera_] As a flower, _Bienertia cycloptera_ produces both male and female flowers on the same plant, classifying as a monoecious plant. The fruits are shaped as small bubbles with a concave head. In its natural habitat, the plant germinates in the spring and then develops into the fall where reproductive growth happens via flowers. There are not enough pictures and research done on _B. cycloptera_{{'}}s flowers and fruits that the distinction remains ambiguous.[10][11][12]\n\n\nMedicinal use\n\nIn Persia, _B. cycloptera_ is widely used for use in alternative medicine, especially for properties associated with antimicrobial, antihyperglycemic, and lipo catalytic properties. However, there is little scientific research showing evidence of this. A recent article that sought to rectify this lack of knowledge by testing _B. cycloptera_ against different microbes and analyzing its lipid composition, finding a strong correlation with microbe reduction and a wide composition of lipids.[13]\n\n\nOther significance\n\nThe plant _B. cycloptera_ has a unique photosynthetic arrangement. As for the cellular structure of the plant, chlorenchyma cells have rubisco in the chloroplasts of the cell separated by channels and the PEPC in other cytoplasmic channels of the cell. This allows for the unique structure of the single celled C4 plant.[14] This is a very unique structure considering that every other C4 plants have spatial separation in the form of cells. However, scientists found evidence for this arrangement by measuring the Carbon-13 isotope values and found it consistent with other C4 species.[15]\n\nIn the field of scientific research for agriculture, _B. cycloptera_ has been used as a subject for studying the potential changing of commercial crops from C3 to C4 photosynthetic plants. Studies on _B. cycloptera_ have found that C4 photosynthetic cells are remarkably similar to that of C3 photosynthetic cells, hinting that genetic manipulation may require less anatomical change than previously thought.[16]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n","title":"Bienertia cycloptera"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the areas in which Bienertia Cycloptera is found.

Uh…”\n\nHe chuckled.\n\n“Daisy, Daisy, Daisy. You had oatmeal with sliced bananas on top.”\n\n“I knew that! Shut up!”\n\n“Do you remember Louis?”\n\n“You mean my husband of four years? Yeah, like I could ever forget him.”\n\n“Then you must remember what you did to him, right?” \n\nDaisy could hear the smirk in his voice, and scrunched her face trying to sift through her memories. She couldn’t stand this bastard knowing more than her.\n\n“I… I haven’t done anything to him.”\n\n“Oh really? Absolutely nothing? Hah! Clearly you need me more than you know. You can’t remember anything.”\n\nThis time he laughed out loud, not even bothering to hide his contempt. \n\n“There’s nothing to remember. You’re just fucking with me. Shut up!”\n\nDaisy turned away, resolved to end this conversation.\n\n“Let’s play a little game. I’m going to describe an event, and you’re going to try to remember it.”\n\nDaisy stayed resolutely silent.\n\n“Do you remember yesterday morning? It was a pretty uneventful day. Louis had breakfast with you and then left for work. Do you remember that, Daisy?”\n\nDaisy nodded slightly, still trying not to engage.\n\n“Do you remember how you burnt his toast?”\n\n“I’m always doing things like that. Louis didn’t mind though.”\n\n“And the bruise on your arm?”\n\n“This little thing?” Daisy poked at it. “I was cleaning up and I dropped a dish. I must’ve hit my arm while picking it back up.”\n\nEven Daisy could hear the uncertainty in her voice.\n\n“Louis was so worried about it, too. He gave me an ice pack, and told me he loved and that he was sorry. I’m so lucky to have a man like him in my life.”\n\nSilence. Daisy ran her answer through her head over and over, trying to see if there were any gaps or mistakes. \n\n“And the stitches two months ago?”\n\n“Another case of my notorious clumsiness. Louis was having some fun, and threw a glass at me…. I mean to me. I didn’t catch it and somehow managed to break it on top of that. I sliced open my hand on one of the pieces.  I needed twelve stitches.” \n\nDaisy started laughing at herself.\n\n“Louis was so nice after that! He visited me at the hospital every day, and gave me the most beautiful flowers. He kept saying over and over that he loved me and that he was sorry. He was always so sorry for my clumsiness…”\n\nMore silence. He studied Daisy for a bit, and in a gentler tone said, “See, this game isn’t that hard. Now let’s skip to the end of yesterday.”\n\n“Let’s see, Louis came home from work; I fixed him dinner; he ate it; we watched TV; and then went to bed…. You’re right this game is easy.”\n\nHe let out a low, cool chuckle, any tenderness gone in a flash. \n\n“Wrong! That’s not what happened last night. You’re omitting one crucial detail. Do you want another go? Maybe use a lifeline?”\n\n“Uh, I can’t remember anything else…”\n\n“And that’s what I’m here for. To help you…” his voice became more and more serpentine.\n\n“The first part of your memory is spot on: you made him dinner, and he ate, and then watched TV. The last part, however, is a lie.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Louis never made it to bed. Do you wanna know why?”\n\n“No. You’re lying! He went to bed!”\n\n“He never went to bed because he’s dead! You killed him!”\n\n“No! No… I would never do that! I’m a good person. Louis loved me! Why would I murder him?”\n\n“Bull shit! You’ve been planning this ever since you became extremely ‘clumsy’. You chose a knife because it made no sound, and you could watch the life drain from his body by your hand. You knew that slitting his throat would be both painful and silent. So you took your chef’s knife and walked into the living room. You went silently behind him and started stroking his hair. He moaned softly and you quickly drew his face up towards yours as if to kiss him. But instead of a kiss you drew the knife across his throat. He bled more than you thought he would, but it was worth it to see that look of understanding cross his face. He knew he was dying and that you had killed him!”\n\n“NO no no no no no no…”\n\nDaisy started rocking back and forth.\n\n“You didn’t count on me though, did you? You planned everything so carefully, and once it was over, your mind neatly erased any memory of it. Except me. I’ll always be here, Daisy. That voice inside your head, forcing you to remember what you’ve done to me!”\n\nAnd he started to laugh. Slowly at first but building into something maniacal and menacing. Daisy suddenly realized why the voice was so familiar, and broke down in tears again. She retreated to the corner, grabbed her knees, and continued to rock, mumbling no under her breath over and over. \n\n*****\n\nBehind the one way mirror the doctor looked at the woman in the corner of the cell and said, “Where did you find her?”\n“She was wandering the streets downtown. She seemed to be talking to herself so I called the cops and just wanted to make sure she got some help. I’m glad they put her here with you. She seems safer in here.”\n“She seems to have suffered some sort of mental break. She has injuries consistent with long term abuse and there was some blood on the clothes she came in with.

What’s cyberbullying?\n\nThis isn’t exactly a new problem following the Court of Appeals holding in People v. Marquan M. that Albany County’s cyberbullying law was unconstitutional. The issue isn’t whether bullying isn’t a problem or doesn’t do harm, but defining what it is and doing so in a way that doesn’t violate the First Amendment. As Eric Turkewitz explains, that’s hard to do.\n\n  There is, of course, lots of conduct that we can all agree is bullying, right?  A kid gets taunted by classmates for his less-than-personal personality, and it’s a no-brainer, right?\n\n  Well, almost right. I mean, friends do this kind of stuff to their good buddies after all.  It isn’t just for enemies.\n\n  But still, let’s say it is an “enemy” of sorts — two kids that actually hate each other. How do they know where the line in the sand is located as to what is legitimate and what isn’t?\n\n  So if Kid A wants to say that Kid B’s support of Trump is “idiotic” or “moronic,” or that Kid B seems to be a clueless asshat for believing what s/he believes, would that conduct, if done online, be cyber-bullying? How about if it didn’t involve politics at all, and was purely personal?\n\n  Don’t we have a right to call each other schmucks?\n\nThis, of course, doesn’t begin to scratch the surface of the problem, neither from the perspective of what is bullying to what is free speech. It’s one of those words that people believe they know when they see, but when put to the test of defining, come up empty.\n\nSo the New York Senate came up with a solution in SB2318A:\n\n  12-A. CYBERBULLYING.\n\n  1. AS USED IN THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:\n\n  A. MINOR SHALL MEAN ANY NATURAL PERSON OR INDIVIDUAL UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN.\n\n  B. PERSON SHALL MEAN ANY NATURAL PERSON OR INDIVIDUAL.\n\n  2. ANY PERSON WHO KNOWINGLY ENGAGES IN A REPEATED COURSE OF CYBERBULLYING OF A MINOR SHALL BE GUILTY OF AN UNCLASSIFIED MISDEMEANOR PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF NOT MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS, OR BY A PERIOD OF IMPRISONMENT NOT TO EXCEED ONE YEAR, OR BY BOTH SUCH FINE AND IMPRISONMENT.\n  3. This act shall take effect immediately.\n\nNotice anything missing there? No definition of cyberbullying. Not a good one. Not a bad one. None at all. It’s a misdemeanor to engage in a “repeated course of cyberbullying,” but what that might be is anyone’s guess.\n\nIs the Senate trying to leave a huge, gaping hole for prosecutors to fill? Or maybe they figure that if the courts are going to be such constitutional sticklers, let judges come up with the definition? Is there any judge so ignorant of law that he wouldn’t toss any prosecution based on this law? Is there any judge willing to create a definition to fill the Senate’s gaping hole? It’s one thing to try to rationalize a statutory definition with constitutional limitations, but this one doesn’t stand a chance.\n\nTurk makes the obvious legal observation:\n\n  There is no point passing version 2.0 of a law that will one day be ruled unconstitutional.\n\nOf course it will, as there is no other conceivable option but to hold this ridiculous attempt to criminalize cyberbullying unconstitutional. But there is, of course, a “point” to passing this shockingly badly written law. It enables senators to tell their constituents how much they hate cyberbullying, how much they love children, how hard they worked to craft a law to criminalize one and protect the other. And when those mean ol’ judges trash the law because of that loophole called the Constitution, it will be on their robed shoulders.\n\nHard as it may be to accept, law is hard, and writing law is very hard. Sometimes, it’s impossible to draft a law that criminalizes conduct that is harmful and wrong because it’s subject to constant variation based on unique circumstances, and any attempt to define it inherently implicates the right to call someone a schmuck. And like it or not, we have the right to say words about other people with whom we disagree in America.\n\nBut this law is just a cynical attempt to game the emotions of the electorate, as it has absolutely no chance of passing constitutional muster. The senators didn’t even give it a try, and as much as they may not be the sharpest knives in the legislature, even they know that you can’t criminalize cyberbullying by defining it as cyberbullying.\n\nThe one thing they do know is that the voters won’t think any harder than they worked on drafting a viable law, and will kvell over their concern for the children. And really, isn’t the what law is all about, getting re-elected?\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the main news event.","answers":[{"answer":"The main news event is the New York Senate passing a bill that criminalizes cyberbullying.

You are not the air, but those things carried on it. You are gentle words and the fragrance of honeysuckle. You are not that quiet breeze, but those light bits of hair that it ruffles at its passing and those gentle chills that it carries in the ripeness of fall. You are those things carried amongst the bitten mountains worn down by your medium over the passage of years and years and years and years. You are the stillness of the water in this quiet lake and the hymns of the procession slowly approaching the lake over those worn mountain paths. They sing and you follow. \n\nThey are a group of not more than twenty large. They are a mix of men and women where the mix tends to fare the fairer sex and those masculine do walk emasculated with trodding steps and uncertain footing. You are the dust kicked up by the feet of these hollow men, a minority amongst those surefooted ewes. You are also the delicate steps of the child, alone amongst adults. You are also the breeze amongst his light hair and the silence at his lips. You are not the shallowness of his gaze or the timidity of his posture. You do know, though, that this one has not had enough years to be weathered as his companions are, their souls as worn as the mountains they cross. \n\n\nYou are the bellows of the man-mountain leading them. You are the difference in the weight of his garments compared to the others. You are not the yellow dye that provides this greater weight, but the wind that gently whips it as they approach the water. You are his words and the songs he leads his congregation in. You are not his smile or its crude comparison with the vacant expressions of his masculine peers, the gentle effeminacy of the women, or the indifference of that golden child. You are his words when he says,\n\n“This is truly a glorious day!”\n\nYou are his words when he says,\n\n“Today we truly bask in the radiance of the Lord!”\n\nYou are the gentle decline in pitch as footsteps amongst leaves change to those in sand and gravel.

You are the hymns sung by the procession as the man and child walk out, but you are not the grating words and eldritch vocabulary they use.

You don’t even wish to carry those weary words of disagreement. You are not the unfocused gaze as the priest ignores those words you never carried. You are the sounds of submersion. You are never that gasp of air upon rising from those cold depths.

A sergeant in the army, with a caring family and spouse, medals to my name and a desire to live. But how far did it go? How far can I run before I fall, and there is nobody there to pick me up? I wanted my memories to last forever. Lively, energetic, spirited: The men I commanded were my bread and butter. Valiantly serving under my order for 3 years prior to Operation Neptune, we held our lives in our rifles. I sat with them on our steel beast, waiting to be unloaded with the other men. How long did we have?\n\nHuddled into a vehicle reminiscent to the Kraken himself, I became lost in thought. This strange plan, these peculiar men. Curled up amongst each other, ignorance of bliss, we stood shoulder by shoulder like lambs to the slaughter.\n\nDainty fingers dawdled on the triggers. Who was he? Who was he to take a life? Only the grateful had the heart to pull, and fire.\n\nEyes plunged backwards, body lurched forward. Crumpled to their knees. Fell to the trenches, writhing in the dirt, men howled in fits of pain.\n\nLet the deceased roam the realms they no longer wanted to exist.\n\nWaves trickled onto our clothes, soaking us from the inside out. The storm rose above our mortal toil; Mother Nature has no patience. Salty sea air tempted our nostrils of home and valour, but it did little to front the horrors on the beach. Gunfire ablaze, our Kraken approached the beachhead. This is true war. Fear, anger, pride, camaraderie, pain: a will to survive. Lead continued to find its way towards my men, but I convinced myself they could never hit me. Hot, piercing metal seared its way through the earth, which may as well have stood still, striking our position with brute inaccuracy. Inside the sudden silence, my superior barked those damn dreaded words.\n\nI was told there was artillery inbound. No reinforcements. 30 seconds was all we had.\n\nMortar seemingly erupted from the crust, taking my men with it into the air. 3 of my men were taken in the first blast. They had aimed that one for my squad. These weren’t the first men to die with me, and certainly won’t be the last. More explosives inbound, and no clear way to escape. It didn’t look hopeless, just fatal. Another 2 fell down, injured, which is another pair of notches on my watch. The squad was starting to break down into fragments, and no longer sure who made it out, we tried to hide, run and fight.\n\nUs, a ragtag group of soldiers, versus an entire German platoon. It was at this point we had all agreed to never be captured alive. We held our position over the lagoon, keeping our ground with joyful valence in the darkest hour. I took a step backwards, and promptly fell into the water. My men must have assumed I’d been hit, I didn’t see them again.\n\nIt seemed like I was floating gracefully for an eternity, and in my frenzy, I reasoned that I was hated by those I loved, and regrets filled my soul. It wasn’t death that did this; it was\n\nwar. I also reasoned that these would be my final emotions, my final tribute, to this earth, and I should cherish them. How would I know when I died? It faded to black long before I fell to my watery grave.\n\nIn my absence of consciousness, I was rescued by a British company steamrolling through the coastline, picking up survivors and POW’s alike. It appeared I was alive, and the luckiest one in the squad, according to those Brits. They would never be able to comprehend what I saw, and what I lost.\n\n“It is easier to find men who will volunteer to die, than to find those who\nare willing to endure pain with patience.”\n\n- Julius Caesar\n\n(Any and all constructive criticism greatly recommended)","title":"[HF] Epitome of War"},"questions":[{"question":"What happens to the narrator in the story?","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator is a sergeant in the army.

The 35-year-old and her husband, a mechanic, could afford a spacious rental apartment in a central neighborhood of Tehran, along with a car, occasional restaurant meals and holidays abroad.\n\nNow they are barely hanging on, even after drastically cutting spending.\n\nLike most Iranians, the family was hit hard by the collapse of the national currency, accelerating inflation and eroding wages — fallout from unprecedented US sanctions.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nPerhaps most devastating for Iran’s large middle class has been the sharp spike in housing prices, more than double in a year. That has uprooted tenants and made home ownership unattainable for most.\n\n[]\n\nIn this Saturday, July 6, 2019 photo, women walk on the shore of the Persian Gulf Martyrs’ Lake in Tehran, Iran (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)\n\nThe Alidadis sold their car and borrowed from friends and family to buy a smaller apartment in a less desirable area on the outskirts of Tehran — in hindsight a smart move, since they’ve been priced out of their old neighborhood by now.\n\n“Right now, this is the most difficult period ever,” said Alidadi’s 58-year-old mother, Shahla Allahverdi, reflecting on the Islamic Republic’s 40-year history as she shared a park bench with her daughter.\n\nIranians worry about the future as tensions between Iran and the West continue to rise.\n\nThe escalation — triggered by the Trump administration’s withdrawal last year from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers — seems unstoppable, and European mediators trying to defuse the situation keep coming up short.\n\nThe showdown between Washington and Tehran has upended the lives of Iranians as they try to survive on less. A bride borrowed a wedding dress because she couldn’t afford to buy or even rent one. More newlyweds move in with their families to save money. Visa requests are up at foreign embassies, with young Iranians eager to leave.\n\n[]\n\nIn this July 3, 2019 photo, a worker adjusts a display of wedding dresses in downtown Tehran, Iran (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)\n\nSome wonder how far Washington is willing to push its “maximum pressure” campaign.\n\nThe Trump administration says the sanctions are aimed at getting Iran to renegotiate the nuclear deal, which offered sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nWashington denies its ultimate aim is to end the rule of Shiite Muslim clerics — though John Bolton, an architect of the pressure campaign, called for regime change before he became Trump’s national security adviser.\n\nSome say Washington’s actions appear to have strengthened the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and other hard-liners at the expense of President Hassan Rouhani, once the nuclear deal’s most prominent champion.\n\nThe Guard has been able to deepen its role in the economy, domestic politics and foreign policy under the guise of security, said Ellie Geranmayeh, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nDespite the economic upheaval, there have only been sporadic protests.\n\n[]\n\nA group of protesters chant slogans at the main gate of old grand bazaar in Tehran, Iran, Monday, June 25, 2018. Protesters in the Iranian capital swarmed its historic Grand Bazaar on Monday, news agencies reported, and forced shopkeepers to close their stalls in apparent anger over the Islamic Republic’s troubled economy, months after similar demonstrations rocked the country. (Iranian Labor News Agency via AP)\n\nIran analyst Adnan Tabatabai said he believes Iranians are “reluctant to take their grievances to the street” for now, amid fear of further chaos and pushback by the authorities.\n\nThe economy contracted by 4.9% from March 2018 to March 2019. It is expected to shrink by an additional 5.5% in the year ending March 2020, according to Iranian figures. The official inflation rate has risen to 35%, up from 23.8% in the March 2018 to March 2019 period.\n\nThe housing and construction sector, which makes up about one-quarter of the economy and is the top destination for savings and investments, has been thrown out of balance.\n\nProperty owners are reluctant to sell and landlords are sharply raising rents because of the currency collapse, said Ali Dadpay, a finance professor at the University of Dallas. He said an estimated 490,000 homes stand empty in and around the capital, including more than 40,000 units added this year.\n\nAt the same time, construction lags far behind the need of 1.2 million new homes a year nationwide, said Hesam Oghabaei, deputy head of the Tehran association of real estate agents. He said about 25% of Tehran’s residents live in rented apartments, and the vast majority cannot afford the price increases.\n\nThe Peyman family — elderly parents and eight adult children — own a 110 square meter (1,180 square feet) apartment in Tehran’s District 12, a poor area plagued by drug addiction and other social problems. More than a decade ago, the Peymans rented the apartment, and used the extra income to move to a nicer area.\n\nNow they are back in District 12, renovating the old apartment after being squeezed out of the good neighborhood by a rent hike.\n\n[]\n\nIn this July 6, 2019 photo, a woman walks in District 12, a poor area plagued by drug addiction and other social problems, in Tehran, Iran (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)\n\n“We have to come here because we have no other choice,” said the patriarch, Moslem, 65. Four unmarried children will live with him and his wife. Across-the-board price increases put marriage out of reach.\n\nOne of Tehran’s newest areas, District 22, is under construction on the northwestern edge of the city. It consists of apartment high-rises and shopping malls arranged around an artificial lake called Chitgar.\n\nMaryam Alidadi and her husband bought an 82-square-meter (880 square feet) apartment here in December, downsizing by a third from their rented home in a more affluent area.\n\n“Our standard of living has dropped considerably,” she said, adding that she now regrets having quit her government job four years ago when her son Rami was born.\n\n[]\n\nThis July 6, 2019 photo shows residential towers in District 22, that consists of apartment high-rises and shopping malls arranged around an artificial lake called Chitgar, under construction on the northwestern edge of Tehran, Iran (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)\n\nThe US sanctions have proven particularly devastating for Iran’s large middle class, said Dadpay, the finance professor. “This is the economic class that depends on the global economy, depends on their skillsets, and most of them are earning fixed incomes,” he said.\n\nThe economic freefall could shape Iran’s domestic politics, with parliament elections in February posing the first test. Middle class voters have traditionally favored reformist candidates but might sit out voting because of a lack of alternatives, inadvertently boosting hard-liners.\n\nPro-reform politicians who favor a greater opening to the West are closely linked to the nuclear deal.\n\nWith the deal faltering, the hard-liners, including the Revolutionary Guard, are becoming more entrenched, said Geranmayeh, the analyst.\n\nThe Guard, she said, “is going to be a force to be reckoned with for many years to come.”\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize Maryam Alidadi's family's  financial situation.","answers":[{"answer":"Maryam Alidadi and her husband used to live a comfortable middle-class life.

A sergeant in the army, with a caring family and spouse, medals to my name and a desire to live. But how far did it go? How far can I run before I fall, and there is nobody there to pick me up? I wanted my memories to last forever. Lively, energetic, spirited: The men I commanded were my bread and butter. Valiantly serving under my order for 3 years prior to Operation Neptune, we held our lives in our rifles. I sat with them on our steel beast, waiting to be unloaded with the other men. How long did we have?\n\nHuddled into a vehicle reminiscent to the Kraken himself, I became lost in thought. This strange plan, these peculiar men. Curled up amongst each other, ignorance of bliss, we stood shoulder by shoulder like lambs to the slaughter.\n\nDainty fingers dawdled on the triggers. Who was he? Who was he to take a life? Only the grateful had the heart to pull, and fire.\n\nEyes plunged backwards, body lurched forward. Crumpled to their knees. Fell to the trenches, writhing in the dirt, men howled in fits of pain.\n\nLet the deceased roam the realms they no longer wanted to exist.\n\nWaves trickled onto our clothes, soaking us from the inside out. The storm rose above our mortal toil; Mother Nature has no patience. Salty sea air tempted our nostrils of home and valour, but it did little to front the horrors on the beach. Gunfire ablaze, our Kraken approached the beachhead. This is true war. Fear, anger, pride, camaraderie, pain: a will to survive. Lead continued to find its way towards my men, but I convinced myself they could never hit me. Hot, piercing metal seared its way through the earth, which may as well have stood still, striking our position with brute inaccuracy. Inside the sudden silence, my superior barked those damn dreaded words.\n\nI was told there was artillery inbound. No reinforcements. 30 seconds was all we had.\n\nMortar seemingly erupted from the crust, taking my men with it into the air. 3 of my men were taken in the first blast. They had aimed that one for my squad. These weren’t the first men to die with me, and certainly won’t be the last. More explosives inbound, and no clear way to escape. It didn’t look hopeless, just fatal. Another 2 fell down, injured, which is another pair of notches on my watch. The squad was starting to break down into fragments, and no longer sure who made it out, we tried to hide, run and fight.\n\nUs, a ragtag group of soldiers, versus an entire German platoon. It was at this point we had all agreed to never be captured alive. We held our position over the lagoon, keeping our ground with joyful valence in the darkest hour. I took a step backwards, and promptly fell into the water. My men must have assumed I’d been hit, I didn’t see them again.\n\nIt seemed like I was floating gracefully for an eternity, and in my frenzy, I reasoned that I was hated by those I loved, and regrets filled my soul. It wasn’t death that did this; it was\n\nwar. I also reasoned that these would be my final emotions, my final tribute, to this earth, and I should cherish them. How would I know when I died? It faded to black long before I fell to my watery grave.\n\nIn my absence of consciousness, I was rescued by a British company steamrolling through the coastline, picking up survivors and POW’s alike. It appeared I was alive, and the luckiest one in the squad, according to those Brits. They would never be able to comprehend what I saw, and what I lost.\n\n“It is easier to find men who will volunteer to die, than to find those who\nare willing to endure pain with patience.”\n\n- Julius Caesar\n\n(Any and all constructive criticism greatly recommended)","title":"[HF] Epitome of War"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story say about which World War the narrator was in?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The story doesn't say which World War the narrator was in.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The story says the narrator was involved in the Normandy Invasion.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"No answer given.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is not in the text.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"NO answer","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The story doesn't mention which World War the narrator was in.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"No response.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"No answer.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"There is no answer to this question in the story.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"There is not answer","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"There is no answer.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"No answer","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":true,"new_critique":{"text":"The story occurs during World War II (Operation Neptune refers to the Normandy invasion during World War II).","category":"accuracy","severity":4,"refinement":"No answer","category_text":""}},{"question":"What does the story say about the narrator?","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator is a sergeant in the army.

Thank you for your patience and understanding while we got caught up. PLEASE NOTE THAT WHILE OUR STORE IS NOW OPEN AGAIN - WE ARE STILL NOT SERVING WALK-IN CUSTOMERS DUE TO ONGOING COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS. During this week we will get caught with all aging orders and communication backlogs, and also deploy new internal systems to smooth out our operations. Our sales and support staff will still be available by email but new orders are now on hold.  If you have things in your cart you'll be able to check out on Aug 30th. \n\nEbike activity has really been through the roof this summer and we wanted to thank both the team here and our customers for their patience as we adjust to this new reality. We've managed to step up our manufacturing throughput so that most of our key items (Phaserunners, Baserunners, All Axle motors, CA3-WP's, LiGo Batteries..) have been in good supply again; our sales and support team have been responding to over 1500 emails and countless phone calls each week; and our packing and shipping team of been getting record throughput out the door.\n\nOne downside of this unprecedented activity is that other items (new video releases, web content updates, R&D, user manuals, new product development etc.) have taken a backseat as we try to stay on top of top order volumes. We're hoping to make headway on a number of those fronts next week too.\n\n\nIntroducing our new Operations Manager - Guy Thorburn\n\n[Guy Thorburn at the BBQ]We're pleased to have brought an experienced fellow like Guy onboard as our first full-time operations manager. Guy has previously been involved with successful tech businesses in BC like Carmanah (https://carmanah.com/), and helped Grin during our first move away from the small shop on Main St. 10 years ago. We're looking forward to have him as part of our core team as we scale things to the next phase in this exciting industry. \n\n\nMore Job Hirings\n\nThanks to everyone that sent in an application for our recent job postings - we're currently finished with hiring for now and have a few exciting new team members here at Grin...\n\nThat said if you're an eBike repair and support expert, we'd love to hear from you - send over an email with a resume and cover letter as well as anything else you think we should know.\n\nWe've had a half dozen new staff join Grin this summer but we are still looking for even more! There are two roles in particular that we could use filled like yesterday:\n\n1) REMOTE TECHNICAL SUPPORT: We're still looking for people with a technical background in order to help with troubleshooting and support. This is a position that can be done remotely so no need to be in Vancouver, but we are after someone who already has deep familiarity and understanding of Grin's entire product lineup and superb typing and writing skills. This could be a great side hustle for an ebike guru out of work due to the Covid situation, and we're open to both part time or full time possibilities.\n\n2) PACKING / SHIPPING ASSISTANT: We're also after another pair of hands to work full time in the packing and shipping side of our business. This job can't be done remote, so if you know someone in Vancouver looking for a manual job with a good crew of people then feel free to spread the word.\n\nIf you are interested in either of these then please send us an email with a resume, cover letter, and any other details about yourself you think we should know.   \n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize everything relating to the store shutdown.","answers":[{"answer":"The store shutdown was planned for Aug 22nd - 29th.

Kennedy, patriarch of the Kennedy clan, went for a shoeshine not far from his Wall Street office. Kennedy was stunned when the shoeshine man gave stock tips to him, a leading trader. He immediately returned to his office and aggressively short-sold stocks, making a fortune in the Great Crash.\n\nThis is probably an apocryphal tale that points to a larger truth: When even shoeshine men are so confident in their bullishness they give stock tips to the pros, it’s time to run for the hills.\n\nThis week we’ve seen plenty of signs of this. As the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.24%  hit all-time highs, briefly closing above 10,000 (nearly double its bubble top from the year 2000), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.19%  and S&P 500 SPX, -0.08%  both came within shouting distance of their February record peaks, day traders and newbies emerged, proclaiming their stock-picking genius.\n\nThis testosterone-driven overconfidence — and research shows men are more reckless investors than women — has been most pronounced on Robinhood, the commission-free stock trading app preferred by millennials who can make all the trades they want at the tap of their thumbs.\n\nThe tale of Robinhood\n\nAccording to Crunchbase, the Menlo Park, Calif.-based brokerage has raised $1.2 billion altogether. On the strength of three million new customers in the first quarter, it just raised $280 million in a late funding round led by Silicon Valley heavyweight Sequoia Capital. Robinhood has more than 10 million customers whose average age is 31.\n\nIt has been having an outsized impact on stock trading. An analyst at Deutsche Bank recently examined Robinhood trading data and found that small investors were behind much of the recent buying in the stock market, so that what we used to call the “smart money” is “now chasing” the day traders. Talk about the caboose pulling the train!\n\nGone are the days of COVID-19 lockdowns and fears of bodies piling up in emergency rooms. Long forgotten are the 40 million unemployed Americans, the 40% of businesses that may not reopen and the “long road” to recovery that a gloomy Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell laid out in his news conference Wednesday. And don’t even think about the new wave of coronavirus cases and hospitalizations we’re seeing in at least a dozen U.S. states. Oh, no, instead the day traders are sampling and remixing those hits of the 1930s, “We’re in the Money” and “Happy Days Are Here Again.”\n\nAnd these mini-Masters of the Universe aren’t just buying the Apples AAPL, -0.76%  and Teslas TSLA, -2.41%  of the world; they’re gobbling up stocks of bankrupt companies like Hertz US:HTZ  and those whose businesses are in deep trouble, like American Airlines Group AAL, -4.95%. Both of those stocks and others beaten down badly in the coronavirus bear market have rallied sharply over the past few weeks.\n\nBetter than Buffett?\n\nNo doubt these very astute people have done deep dives into balance sheets, loan covenants and capital structures the way distressed debt and deep value investors do to make sure they’re protected on the downside. Oh, wait. Screw the guardrails. Damn the torpedoes. Traders on Robinhood and other instant-trading platforms are wagering hundreds maybe a few thousand bucks at a time and are beating the pants off the pros.\n\nOne leading day trader who’s particularly proud of himself is Dave Portnoy, the successful founder of Barstool Sports, who thinks his prowess over the last, oh, six weeks or so, has made him better than … Warren Buffett.\n\n“I’m the new breed. I’m the new generation,” he crowed. “There’s nobody who can argue that Warren Buffett is better at the stock market than I am right now. I’m better than he is. That’s a fact.”\n\nThis column has recently taken Buffett to task for his performance over the past decade. Three of his recent investments lost at least $7 billion, and he clearly sold airline stocks at the bottom. But really, Dave, really? He sounds like he’s auditioning to host a revival of “The Apprentice.”\n\nThe day trading is definitely a sign of the times. As Anthony Denier, CEO of trading platform Webull, told the New York Post: “We’re all home. Some people are making bread, and some are saying, ‘Hey, how can I make the stock market work for me?’ And with the Fed [pumping money] into the markets, they’re thinking ‘How can I lose?’ ”\n\nHow? Let me count the ways, starting with today, with the Dow down 1,862 points, the biggest drop since the dark days of March. Who knows if this is profit taking or whether we’re heading for another leg down in stocks? But some of us remember the 1990s, the days of theglobe.com and “boot your broker” and guys in their basements trading Yahoo stock dozens of times a day. You can “OK boomer” me all you want, but I’ve seen this movie many times and it never has a happy ending.\n\n_Howard R. Gold is a MarketWatch columnist.

She had dark black hair that drooped down her face and pale white skin much like Adam. He got up out of bed to change into his black jumpsuit; the same jumpsuit that everyone wore except his had a unique number, it read 77689. Towards the bathroom, he walked with a slouched back and a slight limp following a factory accident he had a month ago. A feeling of anger came over him but quickly subsided; he remembered the doctor telling him to control his thoughts and emotions.  \n\n“Breakfast looks good,” he said with a cold smile, it was a hot metal bowl of oatmeal and honey. The same food everyone got for their rations, the government provided the food, everyone got equal treatment. At the table sat Adams only son Tim, a gaunt ghoulish boy with razor-sharp cheekbones and hollow eyes.    \n\n“I hate this food,” Tim said spinning his spoon around the bowl, making a horrid screeching sound.   \n\n“Stop that,” his mum groaned looking as equally fed up of the cuisine.  \n\n“Don’t complain about the food, we should be thankful that we’re eating a hot meal,” Adam insisted, something inside of him didn’t feel right but he carried on slurping up the oatmeal. He looked past the drab and grey walls into the window where the sun stood far out of reach. “Let's get going, we don’t want to miss the news,” Adam sighed, as he got up the old wooden chair screamed being dragged across the wood floor.   \n\nThe door creaked open as the family stepped out, the smoke-filled air heated up Adams throat drying it up like an Arabian desert. His lungs now used to the air no longer rejected it instead suffered from every burning breath. The taste was like burning hair which dried up the mouth. Stark houses stood only meters apart to accommodate the growing population. Now at the Town Center, he looked at the posters which hung up on telephone poles ‘Vote for Venessa Cooper 2078’, the same burning anger from earlier crept up his insides but like a fire extinguisher was put out by an irrational wave of fear. The endless sea of people stood around them, a flowing river of bodies. EEEEEEE the siren screeched, and silence quickly came to take its place. The silence hung in the air like a heavy fog but was disturbed by a flash.   \n\n“This is not your daily news broadcast, we call ourselves M0XERS,” the huge screen which usually displayed the news now projected a man with a deep monotone voice. He looked different as his face was not gaunt but was instead colourful and round, he had a dark brown beard that resembled a rainforest, his bare head scrunched up when he spoke. “We are here to liberate you from the prison you live in,” he declared, his tone so serious but warming. All eyes were on the screen then a group of dark masked figures abseiled down the screen. As people watched in curiosity the red paint quickly made out the word ‘freedom’.  \n\nThe heavy silence was pierced by the yelling and hissing of people chanting “This is the hate of the old age!” The man on the screen looked in horror, suddenly the door behind him opened with a loud bang. Flashing white was followed by the sound of gunshots and screams. Silence once again covered the town center like a blanket of fog, when the dust cleared all that was left were bodies. A soldier dressed in all white appeared on screen then all went blank.   \n\n“We need to get out of here,” Adam said as he pulled his family away from the sea of people. Gunshots could be heard as a large military truck the size of two school buses plowed through the group of masked individuals. Gas was thrown at the crowd to disperse them. Everything slowed down, it felt as if someone stabbed him and pulled out his stomach. People were running and screaming as people began getting caught in the crossfire, he looked back and froze.   \n\nBreaths began coming to him but only in slow rattling gasps. His breathing would stop only to emerge like a drowning victim coming up for their last breath. His family still life clawed out of them into the cold hands of death. He looked at the word freedom now barely visible, covered in blood like a 1st graders painting.   \n\n“Go home or you will be shot!” the speaker blasted; this startled all the people still frozen in place to run like birds from a rock. Adam ran to in fear of his life, was he a coward to do so he thought. Nausea clawed at his throat he felt a strong contraction in his stomach, a vile acidic taste filled his mouth as he looked down only to see vivid yellow bile with chunks of oats.   \n\nThe door creaked open and the coldness from the house felt like nails down his spine. His crying was both ferocious and noisy. He blinked briny tears from bloodshot eyes, his thick lashes stuck together in clumps as if he'd been swimming. The tears made wet tracks down his face and dripped from his stubbled, wobbling chin. He lay down needles sliced through every inch of his body the pain was too much, his eyes felt heavy like warm blankets.  He let his consciousness ebb away into the escape which was the darkness.   ","title":"[RF] School short story can't think of a title and need help with grammar :)"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the feelings the characters in the text have about the food served to them.","answers":[{"answer":"Adam's son Tim hates the food, and his wife groans about it.

That means I recently got into writing; I've done some shorts here and there, and I mostly kept these to myself, but I recently became confident enough to share some of these stories. That said, I've also come to appreciate honest criticism as a way to grow stronger.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read it.\n\nA Trip To the Dentist\n-\n\nA few years ago I read an article about a man who had gotten into trouble when a newspaper reporter learned that he was operating a “dental clinic” in his basement. He managed to brush off the reporter by saying that it was his own private museum, but by then he became somewhat notorious for actually doing dental work.\n\nThis got me thinking two things: first, whenever I go to a museum, most of the exhibits aren’t in any shape to be doing what they were originally meant to be doing. Ever see an axe at the museum? They’re all rusty and missing bits, and they’d probably vapourize under the pressure of trying to get stuck in a tree. I think the reason I’ve never seen much in the way of dentistry at the Royal Ontario Museum is because they’re afraid it would scare people away from the museum and terrify what few people otherwise brave the dentist today!\n\nI’m one of the lucky few who’s never had a bad experience at the dentist, so a few years ago, when I hadn’t gotten a proper dental cleaning in a decade, it wasn’t out of fear, but out of ignorance. When I think about gaps in what I think I know, I try to fill them in, and that was my second thought: that with the Internet, you can learn ANYTHING! We have the combined power of Wikipedia and YouTube, and surely someone saw a void in the at-home orthodontist video market. And so, keen to learn about something new, I unassumingly decided to look up dentistry.\n\nWhat a horrific mistake that was…\n\nThere were a few videos, with some cautionary messages at the beginning. Usually it was people describing the bone-melting acids they’d use to etch the surface of a tooth, followed by details skimming over the dangers of the medical-grade epoxies they use to seal up valleys and cracks. Amateur dentists take great pride in their work, and with good reason: few people know anyone who talks about their surgical hobbies, and I imagine fewer still would be eager to assist with performing surgery. They need to act solo.\n\nNovocain can’t exactly be bought off the shelf, either – the only practical solution is to either take a pile of pain killers (which makes it hard to co-ordinate) or “go clean”, without taking anything to prepare (due to the potential of extreme pain, this makes it harder to co-ordinate). And then the bleeding. And then the diseases, not from the original cavity, but from the botches and failures! I’ve read about tattoo artists who can ink their own skin, but slipping means either going with the flow or covering up, not trying to find a donor set of teeth while wrangling penicillin from strangers on a long weekend; patching a tooth isn’t a two-hour chore.\n\nThe great news is that learning and seeing these horrors redoubled my intention to never, ever let things get so bad that I’d become like one of those gruesome images. In fact, any lingering fear of dentists evaporated into respect. I go to the George Brown Wave Clinic for annual cleanings now, and in the process, ironically or not, I’ve even learned a lot about dental hygiene. I even became an exhibit myself once – I still have my wisdoms, making for a full set of teeth. One student hygienists described me as the weirdest patient they’d ever had, but she brought out a tray of dental tools and challenged me to identify the various weapons of oral warfare - I guess that’s a plus. I find it curious that the periodontal probe they use has a black-and-yellow waspy look – that shit terrifies me.\n\nI’m also deathly afraid of museums.\n","title":"[NF] A Trip To the Dentist"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about amateur dental work?","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator read about amateur dentists who take great pride in their work.

Now James Butler is a very ordinary man, living in an ordinary house with an ordinary wife and two of the most ordinary children in the world. James Butler works an ordinary job in an ordinary office, and an ordinary plant sits on the edge of his ordinary desk. When he gets home at exactly 6 in the evening, James Butler enjoys reading ordinary books or watching ordinary shows on his ordinary television. Now nothing would give us the impression that something is out of the ordinary in this man’s ordinary life. Nothing but a giant glass wall that separates James Butler from another world. Now in that other world, there lives a James Butler. Now James Butler lives a very extraordinary life. James Butler lives in the most extraordinary house with an extraordinary wife and two of the most extraordinary children in the world. James Butler works an extraordinary job in an extraordinary workplace. When he gets home, at whichever time suits him most, James Butler enjoys doing extraordinary things, like rock climbing or playing extraordinary chess championships at his extraordinary local chess club. \n\nNow, apart from the fact that James Butler is a very extraordinary man, and the other James Butler is a very ordinary man, there’s one more thing that separates these two James Butlers. When James Butler wakes up on an ordinary Monday morning, and looks in his ordinary mirror before an ordinary Monday morning shave, there is no smile on his face. There’s sadness in his eyes, and bags under his eyes from a lack of sleep. When James Butler goes to work on this very ordinary Monday morning, there is no smile on his face. When James Butler works his ordinary 8-hour shift for his ordinary job, there is no smile on his face. Now the evening, that’s where it gets interesting. In the evening, when James Butler sits in an ordinary bus to make his way home, something not quite ordinary happens. Every evening, when James Butler returns to his ordinary house from his ordinary job, he looks through the window of the bus, trying to catch a glimpse of the James Butler on the other side of glass. Trying to catch just a small glimpse of the smile that sits upon the other James Butler’s face. Now that glimpse, that small of part of joy on the other side of the glass, that is what keeps the ordinary James Butler from going insane. Now going insane would be extremely extraordinary, and an ordinary man like James Butler wouldn’t want to go extraordinary now, would he? \n\nBut there’s another reason why James Butler tries to catch a glimpse of that smile every evening. The extraordinary James Butler, who leaves his job with a smile on his face every day, had a very ordinary past. It was a fun past, but an ordinary past. He watched his children grow up in a very ordinary fashion, and he loved his ordinary wife. When his children grew up and left the house to become adults themselves, James Butler started picking up hobbies for himself, and his life became extraordinary, filled with action, suspense and fun. Now our ordinary James Butler misses this kind of ordinary past. When James Butler was still a young, energetic man, and his wife was expecting their second child, something extraordinary happened. When our ordinary James Butler was working his 8-hour shift one day, he got a very extraordinary call from the hospital. His wife and first child had been in a car accident, and both had passed away on site. After hearing this news, James Butler excused himself and made his way home, where he drank an extraordinary amount of whiskey. This excessive amount of whiskey was the last extraordinary thing to happen in James Butler’s life. From that moment onwards, joy was hard to find for James Butler, and he lived from ordinary day to ordinary day, ordinary moment to ordinary moment, trying not to succumb to his grief. Eventually, maybe as a way of dealing with the sadness, but no one could quite tell, James Butler’s wife and children returned to him. They sat at his ordinary dinner table eating an ordinary spaghetti, and they slept in their ordinary beds at night. Now James Butler kept living like this until he was an old man, but he never became the happy man he once was. The presence of this wife and children gave him some comfort, but it was an empty shell, for every evening he would look at the other side of the glass and see what his life could have been. \n\nBut when James Butler was old and dying, something extraordinary happened once more, for the last time in his life. He got up and left his ordinary old man’s chair for the first time in a long while. James Butler then made his way outside, but left his coat and his hat hanging on their ordinary hooks in the hallway. He made his way along the glass wall, looking inside the entire way. On the other side sat an old man, wearing his coat and his hat. James Butler’s grand children came to visit him often, and even after the death of his wife joy still had a place in his life. Upon seeing this sight, our ordinary James Butler clenched his fists and started hitting the glass that had separated him from joy his entire life. It hurt, but he kept on hitting and hitting. Until finally, a crack appeared on the wall. As James Butler kept punching, the crack kept getting bigger and bigger, until finally after what seemed to be an eternity, it shattered. Billions of little pieces of glass came crashing down, and for the first time since that terrible accident, James Butler stepped to the other side of the wall. \nOn that other side of the wall is where James Butler died, with a smile on his face and a sea of glass surrounding him, while the other James Butler was nowhere to be found. \n\nEDIT: Lay-out\n","title":"[MF] The story of James Butler"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story say about what led to James Butler's very ordinary life?\n","answers":[{"answer":"James Butler's ordinary life was the result of a very extraordinary event.

A sergeant in the army, with a caring family and spouse, medals to my name and a desire to live. But how far did it go? How far can I run before I fall, and there is nobody there to pick me up? I wanted my memories to last forever. Lively, energetic, spirited: The men I commanded were my bread and butter. Valiantly serving under my order for 3 years prior to Operation Neptune, we held our lives in our rifles. I sat with them on our steel beast, waiting to be unloaded with the other men. How long did we have?\n\nHuddled into a vehicle reminiscent to the Kraken himself, I became lost in thought. This strange plan, these peculiar men. Curled up amongst each other, ignorance of bliss, we stood shoulder by shoulder like lambs to the slaughter.\n\nDainty fingers dawdled on the triggers. Who was he? Who was he to take a life? Only the grateful had the heart to pull, and fire.\n\nEyes plunged backwards, body lurched forward. Crumpled to their knees.

The storm rose above our mortal toil; Mother Nature has no patience. Salty sea air tempted our nostrils of home and valour, but it did little to front the horrors on the beach. Gunfire ablaze, our Kraken approached the beachhead. This is true war. Fear, anger, pride, camaraderie, pain: a will to survive. Lead continued to find its way towards my men, but I convinced myself they could never hit me. Hot, piercing metal seared its way through the earth, which may as well have stood still, striking our position with brute inaccuracy. Inside the sudden silence, my superior barked those damn dreaded words.\n\nI was told there was artillery inbound. No reinforcements. 30 seconds was all we had.\n\nMortar seemingly erupted from the crust, taking my men with it into the air. 3 of my men were taken in the first blast. They had aimed that one for my squad. These weren’t the first men to die with me, and certainly won’t be the last. More explosives inbound, and no clear way to escape. It didn’t look hopeless, just fatal. Another 2 fell down, injured, which is another pair of notches on my watch. The squad was starting to break down into fragments, and no longer sure who made it out, we tried to hide, run and fight.\n\nUs, a ragtag group of soldiers, versus an entire German platoon. It was at this point we had all agreed to never be captured alive. We held our position over the lagoon, keeping our ground with joyful valence in the darkest hour. I took a step backwards, and promptly fell into the water. My men must have assumed I’d been hit, I didn’t see them again.\n\nIt seemed like I was floating gracefully for an eternity, and in my frenzy, I reasoned that I was hated by those I loved, and regrets filled my soul. It wasn’t death that did this; it was\n\nwar. I also reasoned that these would be my final emotions, my final tribute, to this earth, and I should cherish them. How would I know when I died? It faded to black long before I fell to my watery grave.\n\nIn my absence of consciousness, I was rescued by a British company steamrolling through the coastline, picking up survivors and POW’s alike. It appeared I was alive, and the luckiest one in the squad, according to those Brits.

You have to realize that this year was significant as how we contacted our friends. We were at the start of the mobile generation. People my age, 16 at the time, did not have mobile phones unless their parents were rich, mine weren’t and even if they were, my friends didn’t have mobile phones. So to contact friends you would call to their house and ask their parents if they are present. If not, you would probably have to search for them at spots they might be at.\n\n----------\n\nIt's the last Friday evening of summer holiday. I had received my student travel card (free travel in public transport) earlier that day and even though I hadn’t planned anything that evening, I decide to catch a train and try to find my friends who live in a city nearby. I grab my bike, light up a spliff and head of to the train station. At this time of evening, there aren't much people at the station. I'm glad because smoking weed makes me paranoid sometimes. It makes me feel as if people are staring.\n\nAs I enter the train, the sun has already set and the absence of most of the moon, because of the time of the month, makes it darker than usual. As the train starts to leave I get the sudden urge to get out. Is it the weed that drives me or some outside force? I don’t know why but I lost the interest of visiting my friends that evening. So I get out at the next station and head for the platform for the return train. I’m the only one there.\n\nAs I light a cigarette and just sit there with not much to distract me other than my thoughts, I notice a girl is passing me by. A beautiful girl with long black curly hair and large dark eyes. I can see that she has been crying, because of the red and puffy eyes. She looks middle-eastern to me. Young, probably just a little older than me. She is wearing a white summer dress. Not tight but it outlines her butcheeks by the way she is standing. Her back shows just enough skin and my teenage hormones are starting to rage. I can only imagine the things I want to do to her before I awaken from my thoughts. I hear the rumbling of the train and see the girl standing on the edge of the platform, about 60 feet away from me. It’s dark, but the lanterns shine bright enough for me to see that her shoulders are shaking a bit. I hear a faint cry. I realize what is about to take place.\nI need to act. I do not want to see her organs all over the place, nor do I want to be stuck there for hours. There is nothing heroic about this, I am just thinking about my own interests. Might she even go down on me? My hormones still rage. I walk to her, she hasn’t noticed me yet. She jumps on the tracks. \n\nAt this point my focus shifts. I hear no sound but see everything so clear. Because of the bright lights of the incoming train I can’t estimate the distance but it looks like I can make it. My heart skips a beat. I jump on the tracks and pick her up as if she weighs nothing. The fabric of her dress is so thin it feels like I am toughing her skin. I don't want to let go, I want to keep my hands on her. So soft. I lift her on the platform and jump on there just in time as I feel the warm summer wind of the passing train. It was too close. Sound returns and I hear the ear deafening sound of shrieking brakes on the train. The girl is crying frantically. She speaks English with a thick accent: “I don’t want to live, I don’t want to live, why, why?”. I realize I can’t help her. What do I know of her problems? I’m just a 16 year old horny boy with a pretty easy life. I don’t understand her pain. I decide to hug her, my hands on her waist. She feels warm. The only reason she doesn't feel my excitement against her belly is because she is in shock. The train engineer is suddenly standing behind me and asks \"Do you need help?\" I let go as I realize he is talking to her. He walks to the girl. She clearly doesn’t want to be helped and runs off. The engineer turns to me: “Thanks. I don’t know what else to say, just thanks.” I realize why. I can see his eyes are watery and just say: “No problem, mind if I get in?” I ask because this is the intercity that isn’t supposed to stop at this train station. He doesn’t mind. I get in the (nearly empty) train and after a minute the train conductor joins me. He sits down and stays silent for half a minute as he looks at me. He thanks me for preventing a ruined weekend. His daughter is going to celebrate her 4th birthday. He wanted me to know that. I don't understand why he tells me. He hands me a flyer about how to contact some -help after trauma- center. I throw it away, I don’t need help.\n\nFast forward 3 weeks. School has started. It’s a new school for me by the way. We are having lunch and a class mate is telling me about her aunt, who saw a few weeks before that, from her home, how some guy selflessly saved a girl from getting run over by a train on that station. I said nothing while my hormones started to rage again.\n\nnote: I don't write. I have never written anything other than this and will probably never write again. Besides my mother, who doesn't live anymore I never told anyone so I decided to write it down. \nAlso, English isn't my native language so I will blame any mistake/error/grammatical flaw to that.\nLastly, I have never heard about the girl again.

I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me.

The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry. A millisecond later, I spotted Nina on the floor. Hands covering her face in defense. The lack of light in the room didn’t stop the fierceness of her blood as it dripped down her temple and into her hair. \n\nI stood still. My brain called in fear but my body made no response. Not even when Todd walked passed me, into the hallway and shut the door behind him. \n\nNina remained on the floor. She held herself and rocked back and forth, letting silent cries out into the thick air. \n\n“Don’t tell anyone.” She whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” Max snapped at me. “Are you going to tell me or not?” I stared at him blankly as the vivid flashbacks flew through my head. My heart stung in bitterness as I recognized that all I wanted to do was say it.

Water is inanimate. It can neither dwell nor sit. What does water do? Rest? Lie? \n\nPerch?\n\n-'Perch'? Are we out of our linguistic mind? Water is not a cat! All those earlier description failures are attempts at personifying a thing. I suppose water CAN course (but only when there is an active current and gravity to push the molecules). In most ordinary instances that we can think of, it appears that water can only 'be' (as far as within the flat, level environment of a deep, lonely well.)\n\nOk then. let's try again. \"Down in the well, the water just was.\"\n\n-Humm. We can't think of a good rhyme for 'was'. We were going to try 'cause' in the next line but that's a real stretch to rhyme 'was' and 'cause'. Maybe we should actually try to personify the water. That might be interesting.\n\n\"Down in the well the water lurked. It was such a ridiculous construct it made us smirk.\"\n\n-Yeah, 'lurked' and 'smirk' are too silly to use in serious writing and we're still uncomfortable with the idea of personifying a thing. \n\n'Bubbled'? 'Gurgled'? 'Rested'? 'Was corralled'? 'Contained within'? That last one is technically accurate but it's too awkward to 'flow' smoothly into a verse. \n\n-Hummm, flow? Nah. 'Flow' also implies gravitational action that wouldn't be at work inside a well. \n\n'Floated'?  \n\n-Well, that's somewhat accurate but really other things float IN water. They work against the collection of hydrogen and oxygen molecules to be buoyant. \n\nCan't something float within itself? \n\n-Nah, too metaphysical. We must keep the poem easy to comprehend. \n\nPoem? Who says this is a POEM? Does it have to be? Dude! Maybe it's a gruesome horror story and there's a dead body floating IN the tepid water! \n\n   \"Down in the well, the water contained the bloated body of Randolph Ringhoffer.\"\n\nDoes the name 'Ringhoffer' or having double 'R' initials distract from the story idea? Should we have used a more common name like 'Jones'? \n\n-What does it matter at this point, 'dude'? How can anything distract a reader if we only have one sentence so far? It's silly to worry about such things this early.\n\n   That's not true at all. I happen to already know that Mr. Ringhoffer was intentionally pushed into the well by an angry malcontent. He drowned. He's been floating there five weeks in the stagnant, festering pool. His restless spirit has been getting angrier by the minute until someone extracts revenge on... Butch Cas... er... Carson. The local outlaw, Butch Carson.\n\n-'Outlaw'? Open well? 'Malcontent'? 'Butch'? Is this a 'Wild West' roundup tale or something? Those aren't common terms and situations for modern times. \n\n   As a matter of fact it is, Mr. Negative. It takes place in 1887, in frontier Wyoming. That's where Mr. Ringhoffer's cattle ranch is. What's with all the single quotes, anyway? Is that a manifestation of your contempt for my writing choices? \n\n-Take it easy, 'hoss'. I'm just echoing the subconscious thoughts of your potential readers. That's the sort of thing that would occur to them. You know I'm your inner monologue. It's my job to critique and challenge you creatively. Otherwise you do not grow as a writer and storyteller.\n\nIf you are just a part of my creativity, how do you know what others will think about my details? What innate insight do you have? You're just an annoying voice in my head.\n \n -As a matter of fact, myself and the inner monologues of everyone else in the world gets together for big discussions and conferences. We evaluate things. We discuss YOU and your penchant to over-analyze small details. It's sad really. We feel you could achieve some great things if you'd just let the writing occur naturally. Stop agonizing over minute details.\n\nOk. Fair enough. I understand 'you' are just trying to help. Could we have a little more 'constructive' and a little less outright 'criticism'?\n\n-Yes. Sure. I don't want you to feel discouraged either. It's a balancing act. I'm digging the story idea so far. I'm anxious to see where you go with it. Just please, for all that is holy, do NOT weave a well-worn cliché about rival wealthy landowners who dam up the river to extract gold from the stream. That would just be 'Unforgiven'.

He was notable for first ascents and exploration in Patagonia.\n\n\nCareer as naturalist, explorer and climber\n\nHe was born in Engelberg, a mountain village in Switzerland, where his`parents ran a hotel. He began climbing with his father who was also a mountain guide.\n\n[First Climbing Titlis North Face in Engelberg Swirtzerland in 1935 by H. Hess, W. Hoehn and O.

Roth through the South Face.[2]\n\nHermann Hess led three expeditions to Northern Patagonian Ice Field. Two of them were for geological purposes, started from the east and was sponsored by the Swiss Geologist A. Heim. The expedition from 1939/12/15 to 1940/1/16 was integrated by H. Hess, A. Heim, W. Schmitt, H. Moser and H. Neumayer.[3] and the expedition from 1945/11/18 to 1945/12/31 was integrated by H.Hess, A. Heim, H. Smoll, A. Valmitjana and J. Studer.

The park was planned to be built in Nashville, Tennessee, near the Adelphia Coliseum. The project was announced in 2002, and was projected to open in 2005. The park was originally planned to be located at an 82-acre site near the Adelphia Coliseum on the banks of the Cumberland River, but after conflicts with the local government, Themeparks LLC planned to build the park in Wilson County. The project was scrapped around 2004-05.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDowntown Nashville proposal\n\nIn the early 2000s, Themeparks LLC, who were operating Magic Springs and Crystal Falls in Hot Springs, Arkansas, and had sold Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville, Kentucky to Premier Parks in 1997, were looking to expand. The company began working on plans for an amusement park that was to be built in Nashville, Tennessee, a city that had not had any major amusement parks since Opryland USA closed in December 1997.[1] On April 25, 2002, Ed Hart, the CEO of Themeparks LLC, pitched the concept for a Nashville-based theme park called Thrillopolis to Mayor Bill Purcell and the Nashville Chamber of Commerce. Thrillopolis was planned to be built on an 82-acre industrial site, owned by the Steiner Liff Iron and Metal Company, on the banks of the Cumberland River and next to the Adelphia Coliseum.[2] Construction was to begin in late 2002, and the park was going to open in 2005. During the proposal, Themeparks LLC estimated that the park's construction would cost $193 million, the company wanted $127 million in public financing which they would back with a $100 million letter of credit. Maria Partlow, vice president of marketing for Themeparks LLC, said, “We have to have a public-private partnership, that is the model for how these parks work now.”[3]\n\nSeveral Nashville council members publicly showed opposition for the planned amusement park. Council member J.B. Loring said the proposal “simply doesn’t fit in with the progress of Nashville at all,” and he said that every council member he spoke to agreed with his opinion that the plan was “ridiculous.” Council member Ron Nollner said that the proposal was “Out of the question, In my book, that’s not doable.\" John Summers, another council member, said that Nashville “shouldn’t be the funding of first resort for a speculative business. If the business doesn’t work out, the city is at risk. Meanwhile, extending the lending capacity to amusement park developers means we have less lending capacity for our real needs, like schools.”[4] Mayor Purcell also showed opposition to the amusement park, saying \"Everyone thinks that it would be nice for us to have a theme park, the question is, should we take $127 million in public resources and put it to that use?” Purcell mentioned that he didn't understand why Hart wanted public funding when he didn't seek a bank loan, saying “For returns that are certain, there is a great amount of capital in a market system like ours. For people with ideas to come to a city asking for funding, that usually means that private investors have concluded that it doesn’t meet their standard of risk.” Hart said that he needed credit from the city, because “financing an amusement park of this size privately would mean taking on too much debt.”[5]\n\nMany people were also opposed to the park's proposed location, next to the Adelphia Coliseum and Downtown Nashville. Because of the area's proximity to Downtown Nashville, many were worried about the park's affect on the city's aesthetic, as it would become a noticeable part of Nashville's skyline.[6]\n\nOn June 17, 2002, Themeparks LLC announced that the 82-acre riverfront site in Nashville was no longer under consideration as a possible site for Thrillopolis. During the announcement, Hart said that “the company is looking at various other locations in Nashville-Davidson County, as well as in the greater Middle Tennessee region, as potential sites for a park,” Hart continued, saying “It has become apparent that there are divergent opinions about the best use of the Steiner Liff site that do not appear to be reconcilable any time in the near future,\" adding “Despite our confidence in the initial financing plan, we understand Metro’s concern about assuming credit risk. We look forward to continued discussions with Mayor Purcell to meet his criteria as well as our own.”[7]\n\nWilson County proposal\n\nOn September 18, 2002, The Wilson County Economic Development Board confirmed that Themeparks LLC was looking at several Wilson County sites. Many people in Wilson County were excited that Thrillopolis could be built in the area, one resident said “Maybe it'd save them from raising our taxes again. We'd get out-of-state money coming in.”[8] During preliminary discussions with Wilson County officials, Hart mentioned that a scaled-down version of the park would be built. Unlike the Nashville proposal, a water park would be built first, and then expand to add amusement rides.[9] On October 15, 2002, Themeparks LLC announced that they had signed an exclusivity agreement with Wilson County for the development of a theme park. Under the one-year covenant, the two moved forward with a feasibility study to project the potential economic benefits of a public-private partnership.[10] However, Themeparks LLC decided not to build an amusement park in Tennessee, and Thrillopolis was canceled around 2004-05.\n\nDuring an interview in April 2014, Hart talked about Thrillopolis, he said “I was interested in opening up a theme park in Nashville, and Opryland had closed, and we tried to work that out with a number of city and state officials. We were at it for about two or three years, but it didn't work out, and some things don't, but it would have been interesting for Nashville to once again have had a nice regional theme park.”[11]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n","title":"Thrillopolis"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about the best rides at Thrillopolis?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer is empty.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"There is no best rides mentioned in the article.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The correct spelling of the planned theme park is Thrillopolis.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"This response is insufficient to achieve a passing score.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"No answer is given, but there is a mention of a water park.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"No answer is given.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"No answer is given, however the text does give a few details about Thrillopolis.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"There is no answer given.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"No answer given.

Thunder rolled and boomed, as lightning lit up the skies. Below, the salty waves tossed and tumbled, growing larger as the wind whipped and raged from the north. The rain came down in torrents, pelting the deck of the wooden ship, and soaking the wood. The first mate barked out orders to the crew who busied themselves to carry those orders out. The sails were taken in, so as to not be blown off course. The idea was to wait out the storm, as the waves weren’t so bad that they needed to get out of danger. Near the bow, on top deck, a woman cloaked in a silver robe stood by a man who was robbed in royal purple. Both had crowns fastened to their heads. Soldiers stood by, on edge from the storm, but otherwise relaxed. The man smiled down at his wife and looked to the small bundle of joy she held in her arms. A small child, nearly a year old, rested against her mother’s breast. She had dark, nearly obsidian black hair. Her emerald green eyes were closed now, resting while the storm raged on around them. Her little fingers curled tightly around her mother’s necklace. Their calm was shattered by the sound of lightning as it hit the main mast. The following boom of thunder was loud enough to wake the dead. Deckhands scrambled as they tried to put out the fire that was quickly spreading, but another bolt of lighting struck the ship near the stern, and soon they understood their battle with the flames was a lost cause. The captain readied the life boats, and had the king and queen begin to board. A large wave crashed into the side of the ship and the queen and her child were sent flying over the side. The life boat was lowered down into the unforgiving seas. The queen tried to stay close to the boat, but between holding her child’s head above the waves and the weight of her attire, she was quickly losing strength. She felt something brush up against her. The queen was so tired at this point, her arm holding her child threatened to release her. She saw the life boat coming for her, she knew she would be safe soon. But her child.. Suddenly she felt her child being taken from her arms, as if the water itself was wishing her to drop the child. She screamed up at the skies to whatever god might be listening. \n\n“Save my baby, please! Save my Allene!” \n\nSomething came up from the waves, a sleek head, covered in scales, long like a horse’s. two horns upon the top of it’s head that looked like blackened icicles, Nearly glowing blue orbs seemed to bring the queen into a state of shock. This was a water dragon. Feared for their ever-changing moods, and loved for their kindness. The desperate mother, without a thought, handed her child up to the dragon, who took it in it’s maw gently. But as the life boats came closer, the dragon’s eyes became a glare. There was a man raging in the small life boat, he was screaming out of fear, and waved a sword in the air. The dragon gave a deep growl and sunk below the waves. \n\nThe queen screamed in horror as she watched her baby disappear beneath the black waves, her strength gave out and she began to sink, hoping to join her child in a watery grave. Large hands pulled at her soaked body before she could embrace the darkness that surrounded her and she was pulled into the chaos of life. She sobbed openly as her king held her, the dread and hatred in his eyes was enough to keep the crew silent while they worked on getting everyone safely to shore. The closest line of safety being Conach Moore, an island that held many mountains. On the eastern side there was a small village that would be able to help them get home to Riochtdome. \n\nBeneath the unforgiving waves, in the calm depths of the ocean, the water dragon still carried the young child in it’s maw, a protective barrier surrounded it so that water did not enter the child’s lungs. The dragon had sensed darkness in the King’s heart and sought to save both the mother and the child, but when she had looked for the mother, the king was already pulling her with him. With a heavy heart she took the child to her home, Farlig Dyre. It was a rather large island, filled with forests, mountains, rivers, and plains. It was a beautiful land where Humans dared not tread, and Dragons lived peacefully. She swam up to the edge of the massive cliff that served as a shoreline, digging her claws into the rough earth as she hauled her long, lithe body up the mountainous wall. Her deep blue scales dripped water and left a wet trail as she climbed over the wall and onto the soft lush grass of the northern forest. She placed the now awake, and yet peaceful child, onto the ground. She held her massive head to the sky and beckoned her elders with a roar. As she waited for the sounds of familiar wings beating against the wind, she gathered a few logs and used her claw to dig a small, shallow hole She placed the logs inside and lit a fire with her maw. Her fire was blue, but unlike most fires, it wasn’t as hot as it should be. It was warm, like a sunny day rather than a bursting inferno. She placed the child near the edge of it so as to keep it warm, spreading one of her small wings over her so as to keep her dry. She curled herself up around the child the mother had called Allene, and looked to the skies, awaiting the judgment of her elders.","title":"[FN]Dawn of Darkness: The Beginning"},"questions":[{"question":"Explain the climax of the story.","answers":[{"answer":"The climax of the story is when the water dragon takes the baby to her home, Farlig Dyre, and awaits the judgment of her elders.","critiques":[{"critique":"The climax is when the dragon takes the baby from the queen.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The climax is when the dragon takes the baby from the mother.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The climax is when the dragon takes the baby to her home.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"This doesn't describe the climax of the story.

While the list does not embargo dealings with these entities, it requires American companies to treat them with caution. U.S. suppliers can no longer use existing licences to sell them products or service installed equipment, but have to reapply for new ones. San'an Optoelectronics is also the world's biggest LED chipmaker by revenue and listed in Shanghai.\n\nXi'an Jiaotong University, one of China's top 15 colleges, and a unit of Chinese Academy of Sciences, the country's top research agency, are also Applied Materials customers named on the unverified list, which was published on April 11, a supply chain source familiar with the move said. Some 37 Chinese companies and research institutions were named on the list, as well as seven organizations in Hong Kong, four in the United Arab Emirates, two in Malaysia and one in Indonesia.\n\nThe U.S. government's move marks another setback to the companies and research institutions who are crucial to China's ambitions to become a global tech superpower.\n\nApplied Materials supplies almost all the world's leading semiconductor and panel manufacturers. Market leaders such as Intel, Samsung Electronics, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, and China's national display champion BOE Technology Group could not make products without the company's tool and services.\n\nAs an industry leader in advanced tools for the critical semiconductor industry, Applied Materials' decision to immediately stop all business with those on the list could influence other U.S. vendors, as well as those outside the country, industry sources told Nikkei.\n\nOn April 12, Applied Materials sent a notice to all staff involved with the named companies that they should \"immediately stop all pending and future equipment delivery, and cease all service activities at their sites,\" according to the notice obtained by Nikkei. The U.S. chip tool giant also demanded that staff, contractors and other personnel immediately withdraw from the sites of those companies, the notice said.\n\nThe notice warned that failure to follow this compliance could lead to significant violations of U.S. trade law.\n\nThe company's actions come just weeks after Applied Materials' CEO Gary Dickerson traveled to China in late March to attend SEMICON China, one of the industry's biggest events and an important showcase for Chinese technology ever since Beijing made chip industry development a top policy priority in 2014.\n\nAt the event, Dickerson made his first clear and public statement about the U.S.-China trade tensions which have hit the chip industry hard. \"The strained relationship between China and the U.S. can put decades of economic growth at risk,\" Dickerson said. He also warned it would be \"a lose-lose proposition\" if the world's two biggest economic powers were unable to get along.\n\nApplied Materials generated some 26% of its revenue from China, its biggest market, in the most recent quarter ending Jan. 27. The U.S. company did not immediately respond to a request for comments. San'an also did not respond to the request for comments.\n\nChina's commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng last week hit back at the new unverified list, saying the U.S. move could harm Chinese companies' reputation and disrupt normal trade activities. Beijing said it objected to the abuse of national security and export control rules and demanded the U.S. withdraw the new curbs as soon as possible.\n\nAkin Gump, an international law firm, warned companies in a research note that they would have to respond to the requirements of the unverified list. \"As a result of this development, U.S. and non-U.S. companies and others should update their internal control program screens to ensure compliance with the new requirements,\" the research note said.\n\nHarry Clark, a partner with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP in Washington, told Nikkei that being added to the unverified list does not mean a broad ban on U.S. exports and re-exports to the entity, but it would need to obtain extra licences and file additional reports if dealing with such entities. It also applies to foreign persons.\n\n\"My firm advises clients to be especially careful to ensure that any export or re-export involving an unverified list entity is scrupulously compliant with the regulation,\" Clark said.\n\n_Nikkei staff writer Lauly Li contributed to this report._\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What is the purpose of the U.S red flag list?","answers":[{"answer":"The U.S red flag list is to identify entities that are not to be trusted.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer is incomplete.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"This is implied by Applied Materials and customers being added to the unverified list.

It was raining out, so I had to Macgyver an umbrella against the loose steel railing to protect my cigarette. It had taken a few soaking tries, but I needed this damn thing.\n\nWe had just gotten through the Friday night dinner rush. Three hours of nonstop tickets, endless re-makes, shouting, whining, crying. Servers fucking up tickets. Cooks fucking up orders. The manager going red from screaming at us.\n\nI raised a hand to my cheek and wiped some of the rain away.\n\nThe fucking manager. I was on fry. We had a bad string of sendbacks: Turns out the middle fryer hadn't been cleaned last night, and shit was coming out black.\n\nI'm not sure how that's my fault. Well, I guess I should have paid attention, but I'm not the one cleaning the damn things.\n\nI had tried to explain that, as eloquently as one can explain something with hot food in one hand, a fryer handle in the other, and a towering kitchen manager shouting and spraying sweat on me from about three inches away.\n\nI took another long pull on my cigarette. The others usually came out here after a rush. Three or four of us, not to mention one or two servers, maybe a bartender, even a manager or two.\n\nBut everyone else had stayed inside, and it wasn't just the rain.\n\nI had gotten reamed out pretty fucking hard, and this time I had given some shit back. I had thrown things. I mean, they threw things first, but they were management. We had all seen what Gordon Ramsey does to cooks on TV. The cooks don't get to come back, they just have to take it.\n\nTonight I hadn't taken it, and my current seclusion was a clue that maybe that wasn't the best option.\n\nFuck, I was going to get fired.\n\nI tried not to think of it. I brought my cigarette up again and yelped when it burned my fingers.\nFelt like I had just lit the fucker.\n\nI reached down to fish another out when my fingers brushed against my phone. My hand froze, time slowing down.\n\nI didn't want to get fired, but...\n\nI pulled the phone out, flicking it on and pulling up the browser. It was still on my bank account, just like it had been the past three days\n\nI re-entered the password, checking my balance.\n\n$47,349.43.\n\nI forced myself to swallow, letting out a shuddering breath. $47 grand. \n\nI checked the deposits again.\n\nWork paycheck, work paycheck, work paycheck. Each one around $900, bi-weekly.\n\nNo where in the deposits did it mention the $40,000 I had received three days ago, nor the $10,000 three days before that.\n\nHand trembling, I tapped the little rectangle to pull away from my bank account. I swiped to my pictures.\n\nMe and my work buddies out drinking last night. One of the servers getting way too close to one of the bartenders. Phil, the dish guy, with a bunch of shots in front of him. Probably spent a week's pay out with us last night.\n\nI kept swiping.\n\nAbigail, her long, dark hair spilling out from a little baseball cap. Her mother, Jane, stood with her, smiling. They were at a baseball game somewhere. Jane hated my guts, but she wasn't going to keep our daughter's happiness from me.\n\nI swiped again.\n\nMy brother, holding a fish up in the middle of a big white boat, somewhere in the Atlantic.\n\nA woman I didn't know, her hair short and sandy blonde. An older man with a beer to his lips.\n\nMy dad, laying in a hospital bed, making a stupid face as my sister posed solemnly next to him. I couldn't help but grin at that old man.\n\nA few more swipes, mostly photos of people I didn't know. A little guy with big muscles standing by my fryer and grinning, three twenty-something year old women sticking their tongues out, drinks in hand. Two guys with their arms around my neck, all three of us dressed in tuxedos. \n\nThe door behind me slammed, announcing a new arrival. I twisted back to look up, hoping it wasn't the kitchen manager.\n\nSomehow, it was worse.\n\nThe man behind me was about six feet tall, dressed in a black business suit with a matching bowler. He didn't carry an umbrella but his clothes seemed to be shrugging off the rain, sending it splashing away whenever it touched the fabric.\n\n“Awful day for a smoke, Mr. Wilson.” He noted, coming over to sit beside me.\n\n“Awful day for anything.” I replied, trying to keep the tremor from my voice.\n\n“Were you pleased with our last gift?” He asked casually, moving one white-gloved hand towards my phone and flicking through it. He brought up my account again.\n\n“Yes, sir. Thank you very much. It was quite generous.”\n\nHe flashed a toothy smile at me, leaning closer.\n\n“You're taking a lot more pictures lately.”\n\nI swallowed but didn't reply.\n\n“Why is that?” He continued.\n\n“Please...” I whispered, looking down. “I don't need any more. You've been so generous, but... no more.”\n\n“It doesn't work that way, John.”\n\nMy fist clenched. I wanted to strike him, but I knew that would be pointless. The rain couldn't touch him. I didn't even know what he was.\n\n“But it's not all bad!” The man said cheerily. He tapped my screen again. “You're going to be rich! Are you ready?”\n“No...” But I knew I didn't have a choice.\n\nI felt a hand on my hand, it slid up slowly to the back of my head. There was a white flash. A searing pain in the back of my skull. I whimpered pitifully.\n\nI saw something on the edge of my peripheral vision, a glowing green light. It winked out as I turned to look at it.\n\nThe man smiled at me warmly, moving his hand back to my phone and tapping on the screen twice.\nMy balance blurred, then updated.\n\n$247,349.43.\n\nI felt my throat go dry. That was so much money. An unbelievable amount. I could buy Abigail anything she wanted.\n\nThen the panic hit me.\n\nI clicked back to my photos.\n\nMe and my co-workers, the server and bartender, the dishwasher, Abigail and her mother, my brother and the fish. I kept swiping.\n\nMore faces I didn't know. The woman with short hair, the man with the beer, my sister posing solemnly next to some goofy old man in a hospital bed.","title":"[UR] Equivalent Exchange"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about the qualities that make a good cook?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer is empty.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The text does not really answer this question.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The question can be answered.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The text does not explicitly say what makes a good cook.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The question does not require an answer.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What does the story say about the argument John had with the kitchen manager?","answers":[{"answer":"John was on fry when the middle fryer hadn't been cleaned last night.

We’re out here only armed with a basic cannon or two on the ship (based on the ship’s model)  along with simple firearms in the armory. There's only one other AGF guarding 62-F since this planet is not the highest of priorities, so we're practically alone out here save for a few other men. To be honest, we’re the crappy first line of defense; we’re screwed out here if we get attacked since we’re just a guard ship. Yeah, we’re in the Kepler Defense Squadron, but we’re kind of like Military Police and not true soldiers, since all we do is sit on our butts out in space waiting for a civillian craft to show up. You know, the measly guards at the front gate? Yeah, that’s us; cannon fodder, but it pays well.\n\n. . .\n\t\nShep, the crew's technician and radar man, noticed a strange occurrence within their vicinity. “Hey Marcus, come check this out; I’m picking up a civilian-model Flier about twenty clicks from our current location, and it’s just drifting out there. I’ll try to establish contact with the pilot to see if they need any assistance. In the meantime, get the others ready for possible boarding if need be.” \nTen minutes passed.\n\t\n“What the hell?!” exclaimed Shep. Marcus was in earshot. “What’s wrong?” Pointing at his headset with a flabbergasted look on his face, Shep responded with a plain “Nothing.” Smiling, Marcus responded, “Then why are you pissed at nothing? Just kidding, seriously, what’s wrong?”\n\t\n“I’m getting jack on the line. Zip, zero, nada, bupcus. They’re either not home, or they’re all dead.”\n\t\n“Jesus. Well, we're prepped and ready for boarding... protocol says that if we don't hear contact within the first ten, and we don't have any immediate backup, then we wait fifty more and establish contact with the other Flier in the meantime. Go ahead and call 'em up to tell them about our situation... but man, I don't feel good about this at all... could the passengers on board that ship truly be dead?”\n\nFifty minutes passed.\n\t\nShep had a positive look on his face. “Well, looks like you guys gotta board it. Hey, look at it this way; you all have great scores after repeated use of the simulators, there's no need to worry... right?” Drake, the crew's intimidating weapons specialist, saw right through Shep. “You're just happy that you don't have risk your life investigating a possibly hostile Flier. You're a valuable member to our team Shep, but you can be a true scumbag sometimes, and it's just shameful to be in the same Flier with a disgrace like yourself.” Shep muttered something under his breath as he piloted the team’s AGF to the civilian craft. \nThe AI guide over the speaker system stated that the connection between the two ships was complete and ready for transition boarding. “Proceed with caution. Ensure all safety procedures are followed when moving between ships. The Kepler Defense Squadron is not responsible for any deaths during the boarding process. All employees must-“ Shep deactivated the blaring program. “The bloody thing’s useless and annoying, you guys know what to do. Get in, assess the situation, shoot some things if you need to, and get out. According to scans, the craft has a full supply of oxygen, air pressure completely stable. We are go.” \nMarcus then put on his gas mask. “It’s just a normal Flier, you’re not gonna need that,” said Roger, the team’s medic and doctor. “It’s highly unlikely that we’ll encounter a biohazard of some sort.”\n“Roger, you know me by now, I’m paranoid when it comes to disease no matter what the situation. Anyway, I’ll lead the boarding line with Drake behind me, followed by yourself.”\n\nCivilian Model Flier, ten minutes later.\n\t\nDrake had a frustrated look on his face. “You’ve gotta be kidding me; after searching every single room in this ship, no one turns up? Not a single body, piece of identification, or anything. I was looking forward to some action, but really? What a waste of time.” Roger’s face looked as if he had seen a ghost; a blank thousand yard stare.  His eyes: bloodshot, twitching. Tears mixed together with beads of sweat streamed down his face like a raging flood. “Roger... you alright?” asked Marcus through the gas mask. He could not comprehend the rapidly degrading situation, seeing that nothing could have spurred the team's medic to fall to such a condition. \n\t\nTrembling, Roger raised his G-29 pulse rifle. “WHY?! WHY DID YOU HAVE TO MURDER HIM IN COLD BLOOD?!! YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR MY FATHER'S DEATH! BURN IN HELL!!” Drake was frozen solid, seeing how his former comrade-turned-monster was now pointing a death sentence at him. He fired in Drake's direction, the three shot burst hitting him in the chest, blood splattering on the walls of the ship. Drake's now lifeless body fell to the floor with a metallic thud. “Oh... oh God... Sam... who did this to you, the rebels?” Roger began to stroke his dead friend's hair, speaking softly to him. \n\t\n“Hush little baby, don't say a word, mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird.” He turned towards Marcus. “Honey, don't you think he's so adorable when he's asleep?... aww, would you look at that!” Roger ran his fingers through the thick pool of blood. “He wet himself. We're gonna have to change the baby together for the first time! I gotta find the camera... now Joseph, would you be a dear and get the powder for me? Thanks babe.” Marcus was terrified, shaken to the core. Never had he seen such an atrocity unfold before his eyes. While the monster in front of him was taking off Drake's gear, he raised the G-29 and fired a burst into Roger's head, killing him insantly.\n\n. . .\n\nMarcus walked back into the crew's AGF, closed the boarding connection, and removed his gas mask. “Shep, send the footage from my helmet cam to Tac-Com immediately and call for High Exec; we lost Roger and Drake...”\n\t\n“Who's Shep?”","title":"[SF/HR] High school assignment: a gothic short story set in space"},"questions":[{"question":"Why is the civilian ship empty?","answers":[{"answer":"Someone killed all the people on board and left their bodies, but who?","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer is incorrect.

Qonqurtai was Hulagu's ninth son and was the senior commander during the reign of his brother Abaqa. He was twice appointed as viceroy of Anatolia, first during the reign of Abaqa and then under Tekuder. His winter quarters were in Kazova plains near Tokat, while his viceroyalty itself has centred around Kayseri.\n\n\nRule in Anatolia\n\nQonqurtai was appointed as commander of Ilkhanid army in Anatolia with Shams al-Din Juvayni as his vizier after the Battle of Elbistan in 1277 to support the Sultanate of Rum against revolting Turcomans.[1] He pursed Jimri, a claimant to Seljuk throne, and attacked his patrons - the Karamanids. As a consequence, Mehmet I of Karaman was captured and executed together with his sons Mahmud and Karaman in October 1277.[2] Qonqurtai further authorised Sâhib Ata to act on his behalf. He aided Kaykhusraw III's efforts to subdue Karamanids and Eshrefids in 1282. However, Qonqurtai had to cease his activities upon hearing the death of Abaqa.\n\nUpon the death of Abaqa, Qonqurtai supported Tekuder's succession in Maragha, who in return gave him the hand of Toqiyatai Khatun, a Keraite concubine of Hulagu and niece of Dokuz Khatun on 12 July 1282. He was also re-appointed as viceroy of Anatolia the same day.[3] However, later in Tekuder's reign, he shifted his alliance to Arghun, which made the former suspicious. Qonqurtai was summoned to Karabakh, accused of conspiracy and was arrested by Tegüder's son-in-law, Alinaq - the viceroy of Georgia on 17 January 1284, and was executed next day by breaking his neck.[4] Later, Arghun had put Tekuder on trial for Qonqurtai's death, who suffered the same penalty as him.\n\n\nPersonality\n\nHe was described as a wise ruler in _Zafarnamah_ by Hamdullah Mustawfi,[5] while Qalawun considered him as a not only dishonorable, but also cruel man.[6]\n\n\nFamily\n\nHe was married to Toqiyatai Khatun (d. 1292), a Keraite concubine of Hulagu and niece of Dokuz Khatun on 12 July 1282, and only two of his children reached adulthood.[7]:\n\n1.

It pays employees really well.\n\nThe West Coast burger sensation pays store managers an average yearly salary of more than $160,000, which is about triple the industry average, according to the latest California Sun newsletter. There is no college degree or previous management experience required.\n\nTo put this into perspective, tech workers in Silicon Valley earn on average $114,654 for the year, according to a survey from hiring platform Dice.\n\n\"In-N-Out is just eons above everybody else,\" Saru Jayaraman, an advocate for restaurant workers in the Bay Area and director of the Food Labor Research Center at UC Berkeley, told California Sun's Mike McPhate. \"On wages and benefits, they really are the best large chain.\"\n\nEmployees start at a higher-than-average salary of at least $13 an hour and have the opportunity to advance to six figures as a store manager. A typical architect in California makes about $112,000 a year, while a lawyer rakes in $117,000, according to jobs site Indeed.\n\n[]\n\nEmployees at In-N-Out Burger say they're more satisfied than others at tech giants like Google and Microsoft.\n Melia Robinson/Business Insider\nThe burger chain offers benefits including 401(k) plans, paid vacation, and dental and vision coverage for part- and full-time employees — a rarefied package in the fast-food industry. In a Glassdoor ranking of the best places to work in 2018, In-N-Out earned the No. 4 spot and beat out tech giants like Google and Microsoft. It was the only restaurant chain in the top 50.\n\nDenny Warnick, vice president of operations at In-N-Out, told California Sun that paying employees well has always been part of the company culture.\n\n In 1948, Harry and Esther Snyder opened the first In-N-Out in a Los Angeles suburb with quality service as a central focus. \"Paying their associates well was just one way to help maintain that focus, and those beliefs remain firmly in place with us today,\" Warnick told California Sun.\n\nIt's not an act of charity, according to Jayaraman. Her research shows that paying employees well leads to better productivity, less employee turnover, and bigger profits.\n\nIn-N-Out is growing. The burger chain recently announced it's opening a distribution center in Colorado, which could allow it to expand beyond the West Coast. All stores must be located close to these hubs because of the company's strict policy of serving food fresh, not frozen.\n\nLoading\nSomething is loading.\n[]\n\nMore: BI Innovation In-N-Out Burger Fast Food Industry Salaries\nChevron icon\nIt indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What is remarkable about the pay packages of In-N-out burgers?","answers":[{"answer":"The pay packages are paid really well, which is one reason for the fast-food restaurants success.","critiques":[{"critique":"The key detail is the high wages of In-N-out Burger's employees.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer could be more specific about the pay packages.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is missing a few details.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer omits the pay package details.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that the pay is higher than the industry average.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer copies a sentence from the text with minor changes.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"It's omitted that the pay is triple the industry average.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer should mention the high wages.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"It is omitted that the pay of employees is high relative to the pay of the industry.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer should provide more details","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"Excellent answer, however it is omitted that the pay is also more than Silicon Valley's tech workers","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"It is omitted that the pay packages are above the average.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"It's omitted how the pay is really paid well.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"To be a reason at all, the pay's importance should be established.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,6,null,1,null,1,null,1,6,0,3,null,null],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"Why does in-N-out burger pay such high wages?","answers":[{"answer":"Because in-N-out burger conducts research and establishes that paying their employees well results in better productivity, less employee turnover, and bigger profits.","critiques":[{"critique":"I'm not sure what this means.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is not a well-structured sentence.

It’s probably better that way, considering that when it can be seen it’s quite a mess. Scattered with shell casings, strewn papers and stray sparks from exposed wires. Not to mention the occasional body or body part that lay in the way as Chad slowly steps through, careful not to trip over the many obstacles. He waits patiently for the lights to flicker again, so he can move freely with no worry of what’s in his way, and searching for another living soul. He tries to call out, but the cold has rendered his throat quite useless when it comes to shouting. Still he must make the attempt. “Hello!” He tries to scream. It sounded as if the word itself tore open his insides as he spewed it out. Chad places his hand on his throat and continues, content with a quiet search.\n\nAs he makes his way through more dead end areas of the ship, Chad begins to lose hope of finding any more lost survivors, until he hears a faint moaning coming from the Captain’s quarters. He stops and listens for a moment. The moans come again. Chad walks towards the open room and puts his back against the wall, creeping his head around the corner. Inside, lying on the bed in the left corner is Captain Roberts, half naked and freezing, blood trickling down his ears and mouth. His skin seems more like a thin pale sheet that’s stretched tightly over his bones, and his hair on his head is patchy, as if he’s been pulling it out. Chad brings himself back around and tilts his head back, rolling his eyes. He sighs and marches into the Captain’s room. “Sir.” He says as he walks up to him. The Captain’s hand is bleeding and balled up in a fist.\n\n“Whosat?” Captain Roberts whispers, eyes rolling around in every direction.\n\n“Lieutenant Chad Harper, sir.” The Captain blinks, almost in awe, and then chuckles to himself.\n\n“Come here, Lieutenant.” Chad kneels down beside the Captain, whose fist reaches out for his hand. Chad cups the Captain’s fist as he releases the item he was clinging so hard to. Chad looks into his now bloody hand to see two brown-stained silver bars. “I’m giving you command, Lieutenant.” Now it’s Chad’s turn to chuckle, but he can’t stop there. Soon his scoffs become laughs, and then what seems to be a mix of crying and bellowing that echo through the empty corridors of the stone cold prison they’re trapped in.\n\n“Command?” Chad replies, wiping tears from his eyes, “Command of what? There’s nobody here! It’s just us!”\n\n“Jesus, kid.” Captain Roberts says, “Is that all you do is complain? Ever since we lost you’ve treated it like the Goddamn Crucifixion.” He turns his head and coughs a fair amount of blood onto the walls. Chad bows his head and traces the sign of the Cross on his body.\n\n“May Christ have mercy on your soul for making such a joke.” He says, raising his head. The Captain looks at him and tries to sit up. Chad puts his hands on the Captain’s shoulders and gently presses him back down. “You need to rest, sir.” The Captain’s attempt took much more out of him than expected. He begins to breathe heavy, as if he’d just run a marathon. Chad picks up a chair that’s been lying on the floor and sits down next to the Captain.\n\n“I know you’ve suffered, lad.” Captain Roberts says, “We all have. But that’s no excuse to just abandon all this.” His hands wave around the room flimsily. Chad looks around and sighs.\n\n“All what, sir? We don’t have anything. Everyone is either dead or captured. We’re on the losing side of a war and I don’t even know what it is we’re fighting for!” Chad’s voice breaks away again as he begins to shout. “I didn’t even want to be in this! I was dragged! I left a wife and a daughter behind, risking my life for reasons I’m still not sure of.” The Captain remains silent. His eyelids are halfway shut. “Sir.” Chad begins, “I’m sorry, but I have to go. There’s just too much blood here. I’ve had enough of this senseless massacre.” He stands up and turns to walk out the door. The Captain sputters.\n\n“You think you’ll find a decent place to stand in this massacre?” Chad stops, and turns back towards the Captain. “Well there isn’t one. Everybody’s involved, like it or not.\n\n“Well then what do you suggest I do, sir?”\n\n“Stand with me. Keep up the good fight. We’re on the losing side against heaven, kid. They’ve got the power, but we’ve got the people. We may have sticks and stones compared to their rockets and lasers, but we’ve got a lotta sticks and stones.” The Captain’s eyelids flutter as he coughs more blood onto his pillow.\n\n“You’re standing days are done, sir.” Chad says, “I mean no disrespect in that. You’re dying, and I’m all that’s left. This is my chance to leave, and to find a place where I can be at peace. Maybe start a new family. Have a life in exchange for the one that was taken from me. Everyone will just assume the whole ship’s been taken.” Chad bows his head. “I hope you understand. I was never meant to do this.” Chad looks up at the Captain. His eyes are closed and there are no white clouds that escape his mouth, which hangs open like an old fool who has fallen asleep drunk in his recliner.\n\nChad leaves the Captain’s quarters and marches up the hallway and to a steel door that’s sealed shut. To the side rests a digital keypad. Chad inputs a code, and the doors swiftly slide open. “Welcome, Lieutenant Harper.” A deep male voice echoes as Chad steps through into the flight deck. Outside the window lies an endless black ocean filled with little sparkling stars, along with several other ships that have been destroyed. Their debris float slowly across Chad’s view. He walks up to the center of the flight deck, where a digital map is displayed on the table. He looks down to see that a rendezvous point has been highlighted two Astronomical Units away, on a dead planet orbiting a Red Dwarf. Four Astronomical Units away lies another, more appealing place to park; a fairly new planet that was recently discovered and inhabited 200 years prior, called Geisa. Chad closes the map and takes a seat in the Captain’s chair. “How much fuel do we have, Mark?”\n\n“Enough, Lieutenant Harper.” Mark replies.\n\n“That’s not an answer. How many AUs can we travel given the damage?”\n\n“Roughly five, Lieutenant.

It is the third single and sixth track on their sixth studio album _The Side Effects_, produced by Michael Baskette, written by Masato Hayakawa and was released on 8 August 2019.[1][2][3][4]\n\n“January 1st” is the first ever soft song by the band to ever be released as a single.\n\n\nBackground\n\n“January 1st” was released on 8 August 2019 as the band's third single and the sixth track off their sixth studio album _The Side Effects_, following the release of the second single “Coexist” which was released just the month prior. It was the last single to be released prior to the album's release.\n\nOn 7 August, several teases were made on Coldrain's social media accounts with a photo of lead singer, Masato Hayakawa, surrounded by darkness, as well as a translucent image of him in the same photo which is contrasted by a flame and water. This tease would be followed up by an announcement made of the official music video, which would be slated for release on the following day.[5]\n\n\nComposition\n\n“January 1st” is an alternative rock song. The track runs at 150 BPM and is in the key of A major. It runs for four minutes and 40 seconds.[6] The song was written by Masato Hayakawa and Ryo Yokochi, it was produced by Michael Baskette.\n\n\nMeaning and lyrics\n\n“January 1st” is written about Hayakawa's dog, who passed away on January 1, 2019. Struggling to cope with his loss, who felt like family to him. He wrote the song to cope about how he could not let go for someone he loved dearly and had many memories of. As a result of this, the chorus would be a direct reference to how Hayakawa felt about it.[7]\n\nHayakawa would directly request “January 1st” to be a single and a music video released by the band. This would prove to be ambitious, as it would be the first slow song by the band to ever be released as a single.[8]\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video for “January 1st” was released alongside the single on 8 August 2019, and was directed by Koh Yamada.[9]\n\nThe video starts out with frontman, Masato Hayakawa, walking up from the ocean on the beach during the night to join his bandmates to perform the song. Flames from campfires surround the band as they perform. These scenes are intertwined with Hayakawa singing the song during the day on an escalator, under a bridge, and in the sea on the same beach while also scaling up stairs in a well which symbolises moving on.\n\nAs of October 2020, the song has 710K views on YouTube.\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nCredits adapted from Tidal.[10]\n\nCOLDRAIN\n\n-   Masato Hayakawa – lead vocals, lyrics\n-   Ryo Yokochi – lead guitar, programming, composition\n-   Kazuya Sugiyama – rhythm guitar\n-   Ryo Shimizu – bass guitar\n-   Katsuma Minatani – drums\n\nADDITIONAL PERSONNEL\n\n-   Michael Baskette – producer, mixing, arrangements\n-   Ted Jensen – mastering\n-   Jeff Moll – recording engineer\n-   Joshua Saldate – assistant engineer\n\n\nCharts\n\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Charts (2019)                     | Peak                              |\n|                                   | position                          |\n+===================================+===================================+\n| Japanese Daily Hot 100[11]        | 57                                |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Japanese Weekly                   | 74                                |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n","title":"January 1st (Coldrain song)"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about recording an album in Tokyo?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer is empty.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"No answer.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The text does not answer this question.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer can't be found in the text.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"No answer","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The text does not say anything about recording an album in Tokyo.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What does the text say about Coldrain?","answers":[{"answer":"Coldrain is a Japanese rock band.","critiques":[{"critique":"The song also provides some details about their production and the band's personnel.

I mean that I am happy. Like, truly happy. It is all because of this tea that I drank. It is made up Chacruna Leaves and Syrian Rue.\n\nAnyway, I drank this tea, which honestly tasted like shit and made me wanna throw up for the first 30 minutes, and after about 45 or so minutes I started to laugh. I started laughing about fucking everything! I laughed about how huge my pupils were, I laughed at how small my hand looked, I laughed at the movie I was watching (it was the onion movie for those who were wondering), and I laughed at myself. I realized in that moment that I was happy. I was completely shocked at how happy I was. I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I was smiling. SMILING! This was the first time in literally a whole year that I had seen myself genuinely smile. \n\nI’m gonna get real here for a moment. I’ve had an incredibly shitty year. Literally since day one of 2018. On January 1st, I lost a very dear loved one. My grandma, to get into the spacifics. I lost my mother at a very young age, and most my contact with her family, and my grandmother became my new mother figure. I was always honest, sharing my feelings with her and telling her everything. There are so many things I wish I should have told her. When she died I went into this very deep depression. I pushed away my friends and I just stayed in bed and cried. I just wanted to die and make my feelings go away. It was fucking miserable. I can’t even describe it completely. It was the suckiest of suck I have felt in my life. \n\nAnd then, I moved. I moved 200 miles away from my hometown of Snoqualmie, Washington, a town just 40 miles west of Seattle, to Chewelah, Washington, a small town 80 miles north of Spokane. I moved away from all my friends and family, and it made me even sadder. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any suckier, it did. \n\nHowever, drinking that tea made me realize how much I worried too much. I worried too much about what other people thought of me. I worried too much about what was in my future. I just fucking hated that I worried about pointless shit. Sure, my life was shitty, but I’ve come to realize that it’s all okay. It’s okay that I felt awful, I understand how hard my life was up until this point.\n\nIt’s December 1st, fifteen days away from my 18th birthday. I think that it is finally time that I moved forward. I need to stop worrying about the past and about the future. I just need to focus on what is happening now. Stop thinking. Just do. Do it. Do what makes you happy. If you love music, start a band, fuck it! If you like writing, write! My point is, just take life at your own pace. Stop stressing over what ever it is that has you so worried. Take time out of your day to think about yourself. \n\nSure, you might want to call me names because I found happiness in drugs, but the point of my, you could call it an essay, was to make a point about that. Yes, DMT made me super fucking happy for like six hours. What I want to do from now on is find things in the real world that makes me happy. I need to stop relying on drugs. I might not quit drugs completely, seeing as how I wanna be a legal marijuana grower (because in the state of Washington you can make over $100k a year by growing weed for a cannabis company). I’ve done drugs, I’ve been there, I’ve seen things. Of all the things I’ve seen, I now know that one thing is clear. I’m happy. I’m happy because I stopped worrying.\n\nIf you managed to read this whole thing, I would like to thank you. Yes, I am speaking directly to you, the person reading this. Thank you for taking time out of your day. Thank you for listening to what I had to say. I know you must be busy. You have a life, I get it. But you actually took five minutes out of your busy life to listen to some 18 year old hippy talk about his shitty life. Thank you for caring. It’s nice that people care about things. Anyway, it’s 1:29AM right now, I should get some sleep.\n","title":"[NF] The Key to Happiness"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about drugs?","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator drinks a tea made of Chacruna Leaves and Syrian Rue.

That was my mother’s mantra. She said it after every hard shift, every failed test, every break up, and every argument. She whispered it into my ears as she wiped tears off my cheeks. I used to tell myself the same thing when things went awry. I had always put faith into words, especially those words. Words defined my life.\nIt was 4:15 in the morning on the sixteenth of July. There was nothing special about the time or the date, but my brain woke me up regardless. I remember how cold it was in my room. I reached out of bed, tapped the small touch lamp on the bedside table, grabbed the robe that hung off the post of my bed and buried myself inside of it. Sliding my feet into my slippers, I crossed the room to turn on my space heater.\n\n\nHad I lived anywhere else, the heater probably would’ve been stored away with holiday decorations and winter jackets, but I didn’t live anywhere else. I lived in a studio apartment with very little space. I didn’t own any holiday decorations and all of my winter clothes were hung up and stuffed into my little closet behind all of my summer clothes. I crossed the room and turned the knob on my fourteen dollar space heater to the single notch that signified power level one. The lamp lost a little bit of light. I shuffled toward my bed, kicked off the slippers and did a belly flop onto the mattress. The room filled with the quiet hum of the heater converting the temperature of the air and I squirmed under the comforter. Laying in my bed, wrapped in a robe and snuggled under a blanket, I knew I wasn’t getting back to sleep that night. I had only slept for about three hours and already my brain had kicked me into consciousness and given me the finger. I laid there for a few minutes and decided, ’Fuck it. If I’m going to be awake, I’m going to work’. I grabbed the laptop from the other side of the end table, nearly knocking the lamp off as I did. I pushed the lamp back into place, increasing its brightness ever so slightly. I flipped the laptop open and was greeted by a page full of text.\n\n\nWords had always comforted me. Growing up, my mother always knew exactly what to say to make things better. She had so many pearls of wisdom to hand out and I had always eagerly accepted them. It had just been her and I growing up. After I was born, the doctor told her she wouldn’t have any more children. Her husband, who I refused to acknowledge as being my father (why should I, I never even saw his face), couldn’t stand to be with a woman who couldn’t provide him with a son so he left her with her daughter without a trace. Kids at school were always kind enough to point out how weird it was that Lindsay didn’t have a dad and when I would report their observations to my mother, she would always get down on her knees, put her hands on my shoulders and ask me, “Are those children smarter than you?” to which I always replied, “No”. Her follow up would be something similar to “Are the girls prettier than you?” This question had bothered me because I looked nothing like my mother (which, naturally, meant that I looked like her ex-husband). But, in the end, the answer was usually “No”. She would ask if they were stronger or braver than me and, as the queen of dares and arm wrestling, I always responded in the negative. She would wrap all of these questions up with one final one, the only one that really mattered.\n\n\n“So then, Lindsay, are the kids with fathers better than you?”\n\n\nAnd I always knew they weren’t. There were some kids in town that were, but they all went to a private school and I never had to see them anyway. I went to the only public school in my town. Everyone knew everyone else and we were all poor. No one had a guest bedroom and most of the houses had only one bathroom. My mom worked as a nurse during the day at the local nursing home and bartended during the night. She was always home when I woke up, when school let out, and when I went to sleep. As soon as I was old enough, I got a job helping out at the library after school. I got lost in books and excelled in English and ended up writing my way out of that little town and into Chicago. I took my mother with me, but she didn’t make it very long in a big city. She was exceedingly proud of my success but I always told her that she was the one who had given it to me.\n\n\nI opened the laptop to find a page mostly filled with words. They were small money words. I hadn’t produced big money words since my mother died. I watched the cursor blink, waiting to be jettisoned across the screen by a slew of creativity or inspiration but it just stood there and blinked at me. I was in the middle of reading the paragraph preceding the boring cursor when I heard a rattling outside of my bedroom. My brain shut down and I stared at my bedroom door, waiting to see if it would bust inward. Someone was in my apartment. I knew that because the closest I came to a pet was the plastic tree by the front door and the dead fern by the window. I remember thinking ’Who the fuck would break in to my shitty apartment?’ but that didn’t matter. What mattered was that somebody had. My lamp was on and my laptop was illuminating my room, so whoever it was probably knew that I was awake. Did they know that I knew they were there?","title":"[MS] Actually looking for feedback on my firsts few paragraphs"},"questions":[{"question":"Who is the narrator's most important familiar relation?","answers":[{"answer":"Her mother.","critiques":[{"critique":"The narrator's mother is the most important familiar relation, but the narrator's father is also mentioned.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The narrator's father is also important.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The narrator is female.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The narrator's mother is her most important familiar relation, but her father is also important.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"Besides her mother, she also leans on books in her life.

Will was always mild tempered, he cursed but ofcourse everyone around here did, and he was never violent, but the last year of her walking in at daybreak and dealing with a four and six year old had changed him, he was still level headed though, so he walked up the stairs, grabbed some clothes, his wallet, his phone, and his keys, then left to a dumbstruck wife, and two crying children. \n\n.\t\n.\n          Will reached for his phone to dail up his old friend Terrance, he was a charter captian and Will could think of no better escape then some open sea. He decided to call in sick to work first, to groans from his boss. After 3 rings Terrance picked up and agreed to take him out, he drove out the five miles it took to get to the old wooden dock. He walked along the side, avoiding the numerous cracks, and got to Terrance's boat. They silently greeted and started prepping, and soon enough they were off. \n\t\n\n.\n         After an hour of relaxing silence Will heard a shout that made him go from sleeping to wide awake in no time, he ran to the captains quaters and saw Terrance slumped over in his seat, he checked his pulse and felt nothing. Will killed the engine and just sat there, staring as the sun lightened the sea, while his friend was slumped confortably in death beside him. Eventually Will slumped against the wall, wiped the sweat from his forehead, and fell asleep. \n\t\n\n\n.\n         Will jolted awake, feeling he just awoke from the worst nightmare ever, he reached over and put his hand on his wife, except she was cold, so cold. Will jumped up and stared at Terrance with horrorfying realization. He walked back up to the deck and looked at the night sky, it hit him that his kids and wife would be worrying about him. He snorted. Might be worrying about him was more like it. Still, he did miss them, which was surprising. He sat on the side of the boat and started dozing off.\n\t\n\n\n.\n         He was sitting on a chair in his living room with his family, but his wife was younger, he looked around doubtfully for his two kids, and only found them when he looked under the table. They were joyfully pushing his chair back, laughing and smiling. Will started laughing too, it was contagious and soon his wife joined it. \"I love you guys.\" As his chair tipped too far and he fell backwards through his floor and into the dark. \n\nEdit**** the '.'s are to help formatting","title":"Story I wrote for Creative Writing class, CC appreciated."},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize everything relating to violence.","answers":[{"answer":"When Will's wife walks in on the third time that week, she screams at him but gets interrupted when Will breaks a chair against the wall.

It’s probably better that way, considering that when it can be seen it’s quite a mess. Scattered with shell casings, strewn papers and stray sparks from exposed wires. Not to mention the occasional body or body part that lay in the way as Chad slowly steps through, careful not to trip over the many obstacles. He waits patiently for the lights to flicker again, so he can move freely with no worry of what’s in his way, and searching for another living soul. He tries to call out, but the cold has rendered his throat quite useless when it comes to shouting. Still he must make the attempt. “Hello!” He tries to scream. It sounded as if the word itself tore open his insides as he spewed it out. Chad places his hand on his throat and continues, content with a quiet search.\n\nAs he makes his way through more dead end areas of the ship, Chad begins to lose hope of finding any more lost survivors, until he hears a faint moaning coming from the Captain’s quarters. He stops and listens for a moment. The moans come again. Chad walks towards the open room and puts his back against the wall, creeping his head around the corner. Inside, lying on the bed in the left corner is Captain Roberts, half naked and freezing, blood trickling down his ears and mouth. His skin seems more like a thin pale sheet that’s stretched tightly over his bones, and his hair on his head is patchy, as if he’s been pulling it out. Chad brings himself back around and tilts his head back, rolling his eyes. He sighs and marches into the Captain’s room. “Sir.” He says as he walks up to him. The Captain’s hand is bleeding and balled up in a fist.\n\n“Whosat?” Captain Roberts whispers, eyes rolling around in every direction.\n\n“Lieutenant Chad Harper, sir.” The Captain blinks, almost in awe, and then chuckles to himself.\n\n“Come here, Lieutenant.” Chad kneels down beside the Captain, whose fist reaches out for his hand. Chad cups the Captain’s fist as he releases the item he was clinging so hard to. Chad looks into his now bloody hand to see two brown-stained silver bars. “I’m giving you command, Lieutenant.” Now it’s Chad’s turn to chuckle, but he can’t stop there. Soon his scoffs become laughs, and then what seems to be a mix of crying and bellowing that echo through the empty corridors of the stone cold prison they’re trapped in.\n\n“Command?” Chad replies, wiping tears from his eyes, “Command of what? There’s nobody here! It’s just us!”\n\n“Jesus, kid.” Captain Roberts says, “Is that all you do is complain? Ever since we lost you’ve treated it like the Goddamn Crucifixion.” He turns his head and coughs a fair amount of blood onto the walls. Chad bows his head and traces the sign of the Cross on his body.\n\n“May Christ have mercy on your soul for making such a joke.” He says, raising his head. The Captain looks at him and tries to sit up. Chad puts his hands on the Captain’s shoulders and gently presses him back down. “You need to rest, sir.” The Captain’s attempt took much more out of him than expected. He begins to breathe heavy, as if he’d just run a marathon. Chad picks up a chair that’s been lying on the floor and sits down next to the Captain.\n\n“I know you’ve suffered, lad.” Captain Roberts says, “We all have. But that’s no excuse to just abandon all this.” His hands wave around the room flimsily. Chad looks around and sighs.\n\n“All what, sir? We don’t have anything. Everyone is either dead or captured. We’re on the losing side of a war and I don’t even know what it is we’re fighting for!” Chad’s voice breaks away again as he begins to shout. “I didn’t even want to be in this! I was dragged! I left a wife and a daughter behind, risking my life for reasons I’m still not sure of.” The Captain remains silent. His eyelids are halfway shut. “Sir.” Chad begins, “I’m sorry, but I have to go. There’s just too much blood here. I’ve had enough of this senseless massacre.” He stands up and turns to walk out the door. The Captain sputters.\n\n“You think you’ll find a decent place to stand in this massacre?” Chad stops, and turns back towards the Captain. “Well there isn’t one. Everybody’s involved, like it or not.\n\n“Well then what do you suggest I do, sir?”\n\n“Stand with me. Keep up the good fight. We’re on the losing side against heaven, kid. They’ve got the power, but we’ve got the people. We may have sticks and stones compared to their rockets and lasers, but we’ve got a lotta sticks and stones.” The Captain’s eyelids flutter as he coughs more blood onto his pillow.\n\n“You’re standing days are done, sir.” Chad says, “I mean no disrespect in that. You’re dying, and I’m all that’s left. This is my chance to leave, and to find a place where I can be at peace. Maybe start a new family. Have a life in exchange for the one that was taken from me. Everyone will just assume the whole ship’s been taken.” Chad bows his head. “I hope you understand. I was never meant to do this.” Chad looks up at the Captain. His eyes are closed and there are no white clouds that escape his mouth, which hangs open like an old fool who has fallen asleep drunk in his recliner.\n\nChad leaves the Captain’s quarters and marches up the hallway and to a steel door that’s sealed shut. To the side rests a digital keypad. Chad inputs a code, and the doors swiftly slide open. “Welcome, Lieutenant Harper.” A deep male voice echoes as Chad steps through into the flight deck. Outside the window lies an endless black ocean filled with little sparkling stars, along with several other ships that have been destroyed. Their debris float slowly across Chad’s view. He walks up to the center of the flight deck, where a digital map is displayed on the table. He looks down to see that a rendezvous point has been highlighted two Astronomical Units away, on a dead planet orbiting a Red Dwarf. Four Astronomical Units away lies another, more appealing place to park; a fairly new planet that was recently discovered and inhabited 200 years prior, called Geisa. Chad closes the map and takes a seat in the Captain’s chair. “How much fuel do we have, Mark?”\n\n“Enough, Lieutenant Harper.” Mark replies.\n\n“That’s not an answer. How many AUs can we travel given the damage?”\n\n“Roughly five, Lieutenant. Where would you have me direct us?” Chad sits in his chair, one hand wrapped around his face and sweating, despite the freezing temperature. In his other hand lays the Captain’s silver bars. He stares at them, a look of anger quickly growing on his face.\n\n“You son of a bitch.” Chad whispers as he pins the medal to his uniform.\n\n“What was that, Lieutenant?”\n\n“It’s Captain, Mark. And take us to the damn rendezvous point.”","title":"The Captain"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the surprise in the plot.","answers":[{"answer":"Chad is surprised to find the Captain alive.

According to _Los Angeles Times_ reporter Nathan Fenno, who was in the courtroom today for Voynov’s preliminary hearing, it was alleged that the defenceman choked, kicked and punched his wife. Effectively, the allegation is that he laid a beating on her.\n\nBack on October 20, Voynov was suspended indefinitely with pay following his arrest on suspicion of domestic violence. At that time, the Police Department of the City of Redondo Beach issued this press release indicating that a female could be heard “screaming” and “crying” and that, later that night, Voynov accompanied the alleged victim to the hospital where he was arrested on suspicion that he inflicted the harm.\n\nDISTURBING EVIDENCE OF A BEATING\n\nHere are some of the more disturbing allegations raised in Court today as reproduced from Fenno’s Twitter timeline:\n\n- Redondo Beach police officer: Voynov's wife had laceration over left eye, blood streaming, red marks on neck.\n\n- Officer says Voynov's wife said he struck her in the face with his fist.\n\n- Officer: Voynov pushed wife to ground multiple times, kicked her repeatedly while on ground, chocked her three times.\n\n- Officer: Voynov pushed her into flat-screen TV where she cut her face.\n\n- Officer: Voynov's wife required eight stitches to close wound above left eye.\n\n- Officer: \"There's bruising, red marks, scratches on the victim's neck.\"\n\n- At Voynov's home, the officer noted blood all over bedroom, including covering comforter and a bloody handprint on floor.\n\n- Lead prosecutor Frank Dunnick: \"there's evidence to suggest prior domestic violence\" involving Voynov.\n\nFenno added that while he could only “catch quick glimpses of photos of the injuries to Voynov's wife” and there was “lots of blood.”\n\nVOIDING OF CONTRACT, PRISON & DEPORTATION FOR VOYNOV\n\nVoynov is facing a number of legal issues. Firstly, he could be deported. In the United States, the crime of domestic violence can lead to serious immigration consequences for defendants who are not U.S. citizens. Under a federal U.S. law called the _Immigration and Nationality Act_, a non-citizen can be ordered deported if he is convicted of domestic violence.\n\nVoynov is also facing jail time. He was charged under Section 273.5 of the _California Penal Code_ for willfully inflicting corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition upon a person. The charge can either be a felony or the less serious misdemeanor. The type of charge depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the injuries sustained and whether the defendant has a history of violence.\n\nIn this case, Voynov was charged with a felony. As a result, he is facing up to four years in state jail with an additional five years if he inflicted great bodily injury. If he had been charged with a misdemeanor, he would have been facing up to one year in county jail.\n\nThere is also a risk that Voynov’s contract could be voided (or terminated) by the NHL. The NHL CBA at Article 18-A.2 provides Commissioner Gary Bettman with very broad disciplinary powers when dealing with off-ice conduct that is “_DETRIMENTAL TO OR AGAINST THE WELFARE OF THE LEAGUE OR THE GAME OF HOCKEY_”. Among the punishments the Commissioner may impose is the termination of a player’s contract.\n\nThe voiding of Voynov’s contract would most certainly be challenged by Donald Fehr and the NHLPA. However, terminating Voynov’s contract would not be unreasonable if the evidence is deemed reliable. Ray Rice changed everything. Indeed, the dramatically altered landscape surrounding domestic violence may force the hand of the league. And the CBA gives Bettman the power to take action (although the NHLPA would argue there are limits to that power).\n\nOnly time will tell. For now, expect the NHL to do nothing and await the disposition of the criminal proceedings. Voynov will remain suspended indefinitely. Once the criminal proceedings wrap up, the NHL will make its decision. While things look exceedingly bleak for Voynov, they could get a lot worse should the photographs featuring his wife’s injuries leak to the public.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What are the downsides Voynov faces for beating his wife?","answers":[{"answer":"Voynov could be deported, charged with a felony, face jail time up to four years, and face the voiding of his contract by the NHL.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention that the contract could be terminated.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The response could be clearer in the mention of the contract.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"\"face jail time\" - replace \"face\" with \"faces\"","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention the risk of the photos leaking.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer could be more specific about what deportation means.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"It is also stated that there is evidence to suggest prior domestic violence.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"It is omitted that he could also face the voiding of his contract by the NHL.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What does the article say about vigilante justice?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The article does not mention vigilante justice.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is empty.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that the article does not mention anything about vigilante justice.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"Nothing","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null}]}}

I carefully open the door and slowly drag myself out of the car. I take a moment to observe my surroundings. I am standing on top of 'Sterling Cliff,' named after the man who discovered it. It's really a popular hangout spot for high schoolers like me (though I don't use it to hangout), but being that it's winter break, I seem to be alone for the time being. If you take the underpass off of route 20 and keep going straight until you see a **DO NOT ENTER** sign, you'd be where I am now. I dare not look down, though I wouldn't mind if an accident were to have me greet the rubble a few miles down. Today's been a rough day. I climb onto the roof of my car and let my legs dangle over the windshield. I fish my pockets for a cigarette to calm my nerves, but I find nothing. I always carry a vaporizer, however, in case I find myself in the situation I am in currently. They say these devices are supposed to be safer than cigarettes. I guess I'll choose the poison that kills me the slowest.\n\nI take out the vaporizer from my breast pocket and fiddle with it as I look out into the sky. The sky glows with a red-orange hue, as if the sky has been set on fire. The clouds and rich colors permeating the sky coalesce to form a scene right out of a painting by Monet. Little stars soon appear to dot the sky, though they are enveloped by the large, dark clouds beginning to form. Though this beautiful scenery surrounds me, I feel nothing. There's a void in my life that needs to be filled, or so it seems. I take a long drag from my vaporizer. A deep exhale follows as I watch the strawberry flavored smoke rise up until it kisses the sky and disappears. Truly surreal. I feel something cold and wet hit my shoulder. Suddenly, a flurry of snow begins to descend upon me and the sky changes color accordingly to a depressing dark-blue color. Atleast the dreary weather matches my mood now. \n\nI feel the snow melt on my dark, silky hair, which reminds me, I forgot to bring a jacket. I take another puff of my vaporizer and let the chemicals seep into my brain. I still don't feel anything, but I sense I'm more placid and lethargic than when I arrived here. I wish I could just curl up into a ball and sleep. Slowly the world will forget about me. I would never achieve success, but I would not experience failure. It's a fair trade-off to me. I could shirk my responsibilities and live on my own accord. There's too much uncertainty in my future. Too many expectations placed on me. I wish I could transcend this body and live amongst the stars. \n\nI place the vaporizer to my mouth and inhale, letting the strawberry vapor dance on my tongue, and exhale once again. I see my smoke exit my cold lips and realize that it's stopped snowing. The clouds have parted to reveal a sky bespeckled with stars and a lone crescent moon. I remember when I was young, I used to chase the moon, thinking one day I could reach out and grab it for myself. I don't remember why I wanted it so bad though. Maybe it was so I could impress my peers during show-and-tell. Maybe it was because I knew a lifeless piece of rock would treat me better than those that have surrounded me my entire life. I let out a yawn as I'm ruminating and realize it's only the bright moonlight that's keeping me awake. I jump down the roof of my car and enter it. The car howls into submission, a noise matched only by the gust of wind outside, as I enter the key into the ignition and drive away home.","title":"[RF] A Night Under the Stars."},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about vaporizers?","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator mentions he always carries a vaporizer with him.

Bassett.[16][17][18] She was the first Latina to head the Health Department.[19][20][21]\n\nCoronavirus pandemic\n\nOn January 26, 2020, over a month before the first coronavirus cases were confirmed in the New York City area in the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, Barbot said at a press conference: “We are encouraging New Yorkers to go about their everyday lives and suggest practicing everyday precautions that we do through the flu season”.[22] On February 2, with the city's first coronavirus case under investigation, Barbot stated: “The risk to New Yorkers from coronavirus is low and ... our preparedness as a city is very high. There is no reason not to take the subway, not to take the bus, not to go out to your favorite restaurant, and certainly not to miss the [Chinatown Lunar New Year Parade and Festival] parade next Sunday [Feb. 9].”[23][24] At the end of March, political commentator Tucker Carlson criticized her, saying “Future generations are gonna watch that video with their jaws open in disbelief. How could someone charged with protecting public health so recklessly endanger it?”[25]\n\nOn March 2 she said that people can't contract coronavirus through casual, short-term exposure, but instead require prolonged exposure to the infected person's secretions.[26] At a press conference on March 3, Barbot said: “We are encouraging New Yorkers to go about their everyday lives”.[27] On March 20 Barbot warned that masks should only be used by people who are showing symptoms, saying: “The time to use a mask is when someone is symptomatic, when they’re coughing, when they’re sneezing, and it’s to ensure that that individual doesn’t contaminate other folks. It gives people who are asymptomatic a false sense of security that if they wear this mask, they don’t have to wash their hands, they don’t have to cover their mouths and their noses when they cough or they sneeze.”[28]\n\nBarbot denied a New York Police Department (NYPD) request for 500,000 surgical masks in mid-March.[29] She told NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan during the heated dispute that “I don't give two rats’ asses about your cops.” Monahan asked Barbot for 500,000 masks, but she said she could only provide 50,000, saying “I need them for others.” The Detectives' Endowment Association, Sergeants Benevolent Association, and Police Benevolent Association called for her to be fired, as did Democrat Representative Max Rose.[30] The Sergeants Benevolent Association expressed their displeasure through an obscene tweet and statement from President Ed Mullins. Barbot later apologized for her private statement.[31]\n\nUltimately, citing her deep distress with the mayor's actions, she resigned on August 4, 2020.[32] A press release from the mayor later that day announced the appointment of Dave A. Chokshi as her replacement.[33]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] Meredith Cohn (July 7, 2010). “N.Y. official to lead Baltimore's health department,” _The Baltimore Sun_.\n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] Jillian Jorgensen. “Dr. Oxiris Barbot named New York City health commissioner,” _New York Daily News_.\n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] James Ford. “NYC leaders try to quell coronavirus concerns after 1st confirmed case,” PIX11.\n\n[27] \n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] \n\n[31] \n\n[32] \n\n[33] \n","title":"Oxiris Barbot"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarise how Barbot's actions were perceived as reckless regarding the covid pandemic and what led to her resignation from office.","answers":[{"answer":"At a press conference in January 2020, Barbot asserts the ease at which New Yorkers could contract the Covid-19 virus, despite the fact that the virus has not yet been confirmed in the New York City area.

It is located in the Municipality of Pivka in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. It has many marked trails and a macadamized road leading to its peak. There is a historical trail intended for tourists with many information signs around its peak. It served an important military role during the Second World War, since it contained many tunnels and bunkers used by Italian army.[2]It is named after St. Primož and the Felicijan church, which was abandoned in the eighteenth century with practically no ruins leftover.[3]\n\n\nLocation\n\nPrimož is located in the Municipality of Pivka in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. The town of Pivka is built on the northern and northeastern slopes of Primož.[4] It has a commanding view over the entire Pivka basin which contributed to its military importance during the Second World War.\n\n\nHistory\n\nAfter the end of World War 1, Primož hill became Italian territory following an agreement between Italy, Great Britain, France and Russia alongside South Tyrol, Istria, Dalmatia and various islands in the Adriatic sea. On November 12th, 1920, the border was drawn in accordance with the Treaty of Rapallo, crossing the Pivka basin, on the ridge of the Javorniki mountain chain. Primož's military tunnels were dug in 1930 as a part of the long Alpine Wall, a vast series of Italian Defense fortifications. The tunnels consisted of two lines; one directly on the border, and the second one a few kilometers behind it. Locals were kept away from the tunnels, and were only allowed to bring basic materials and food near its premises. The tunnels were constructed only by verified members of the Italian National Fascist Party.[5] The tunnels were secured with steel plates coated with a thick layer of concrete. The tunnels are long in total,[6] but they were never used for military purposes.[7] After the withdrawal of Italian forces, local people took valuables from the area, and in 1944, German forces destroyed the tunnels in fear that allied Partisans would find military use for them.[8]\n\nThere are a number of tourist trails leading to the peak. The historical trail has information signs at the summit which explain the history of Primož in detail.

It didn’t, the hinges had come off. I guess I didn’t know my own strength. The staircase was right in front of me now so I descended into the living room. No one was there, not even the dogs. This house is empty. My family left me, took off to someplace distant. I suppose they had gotten tired of me.\n\nI hadn’t had a job for months and my brain wasn’t working quite right. They noticed the lack of work but had no clue what was inside my head. \n\nThey had left everything inside the house, all the furniture, the tv, the food, almost all of their belongings except what was necessary. It was torture. It was like they could walk in at any moment and say they had gone to the grocery store. But this was not the case, they were gone and weren’t coming back. It had been awhile since I’d seen them, no warning was issued. They had finally surprised me.\n \nI picked up the telephone and heard the empty space. When I tried to dial out it made animal noises instead of beeps. I got sick of it and plunked it back down. The electricity was still working but none of the objects that used it functioned correctly. The fridge was hot, the clock was lying, the lights made sounds; I flicked a switch and heard a man yell “get away!” The television only had one channel, and we had cable.\n \nSomething was terribly wrong so I walked outside. The small car my family owned was still there but it did not have any wheels. I took a walk down the street and looked around the town I had always lived. My neighbor was shoveling the sidewalk, but as far as I could tell there was no snow.\n\n“What a storm, eh?” She huffed out as she scooped.\n\nI gave her a puzzled look and moved on. As I walked away I heard her say under her breath “What a friggin storm” \n\nAs I moved along I walked past a small pizza place that had been on the corner forever. Only now it was not a pizza place, it was a clothing store titled ‘heaven’s little closet.” I looked in the window and all of the old employees were still there except now they had on fancy suits and were selling vintage clothing, not pizza.\n \nWEIRD, strange…this is just not right.\n\nA dog approached me and sniffed my boots. I scratched its ears and moved along once again. I got sick to my stomach and my eyes started to blur so I turned around and headed back towards my home. I  noticed a strong stench from outside of the house and as I walked inside it got worse. The hot fridge was melting all of the food inside into a boiling swamp of stink. I could hardly handle it. I looked inside and almost vomited, but I held my composure.\n \nNothing in this town was right anymore, I don’t know if I had changed or if it was the whole place itself but I had always hated living here so maybe it was a sign to get to someplace new. I packed a small bag of clothing and some food that wasn’t in the rotting fridge and walked outside. \n\nI passed a small field of grass on my way and took the time to lie down. Grass hadn’t changed, it felt the very same. I must have fallen asleep because when I opened my eyes it had gotten somewhat darker. I grabbed my bag, which was now a different bag, blue instead of black, and headed toward the bus station. It was on the other side of the street from where I remembered it being. I got on and didn’t even look where it was going to.

Steverson told the Inside Higher Ed that the poor dears were becoming \"antsy.\"\n\nWell, that's one way of putting it when college students hurl vicious insults — including the ever-popular \"fascist\" epithet — at a renowned scholar in an attempt to intimidate. Let's face it: What these students did at Lewis & Clark was a macro-aggression. And the diversity dean catered to them.\n\nSommers, as we all know, is just one of a growing list of prominent intellectuals who have been shouted down on American college campuses.  At least in this instance there were no reported physical injuries, as was the case when a faculty member at posh Middlebury College in Vermont was injured escorting Charles Murray, another American Enterprise Institute scholar and author, through a howling mob of students. \n\nIt has become customary, when these all too common eruptions occur, to opine that the guarantee of the right of free speech, enshrined in the Bill of Rights, is in jeopardy. We also observe that these students don't want to hear ideas different from their own. I think this is far too kind.\n\nThe concentration on the threat to free speech, valid though it is, actually obscures the nature of the greater peril we are facing: We're starting way too far up the food chain with a sophisticated concept such as the right of freedom of speech. What we are really seeing is that the most lavishly financed university system in the history of mankind — or should I say peoplekind? — isn't educating people. In my day, nobody cared if we got \"antsy\" during a lecture: We were there to learn. \n\nThese kids are not refusing to grapple merely with ideas that are different from theirs but, I submit, are ill-prepared to engage with ideas. Period. And how could it be otherwise? These opinionated kids don't even know the definition of the all-purpose label fascist. Look it up, class, fascists engaged in street brawls and disruption to forestall debate.\n\nA look at the US News & World Report description of the Lewis & Clark Law School offerings sheds some light on why students didn't show up intrigued to listen to an iconoclastic thinker. For tuition and fees of $43,290 a year, the Lewis & Clark future lawyer...\n\n  “...can focus in legal areas including global law, Indian law, and more. Among specialty programs, the institution has a high law school ranking in environmental law.\"\n\nHands-on training can occur in \"the Animal Law Clinic and the International Environmental Law Project. ... Northwestern Law school operates several centers that also offer research and training opportunities for law students, including the Center for Animal Law Studies, the National Crime Victim Law Institute, and the Natural Resources Law Institute.\n\nAdditionally:\n\n  “Students may also seek out involvement opportunities in the school’s clubs and organizations, from the Latino Law Society to the softball league. Law reviews at the Lewis & Clark College Northwestern School of Law include Animal Law, Environmental Law, and the Lewis & Clark Law Review.\"\n\nSadly, this may not be the most solid preparation for understanding the ins and outs of the legal theory or writing briefs for clients. While there is nothing wrong with studying animal or environmental law — and these fields are prominently represented at top law schools — U.S. News choice to highlight them is an indication that such trendy offerings may be more attractive prospective students that duller studies in, say, constitutional, corporate law, or criminal (for humans) law.   \n\nRightly concerned about the atmosphere on campus, Erwin Chemerinsky and Howard Gillman (respectively dean of the law school at Berkeley, and chancellor of the University of California, Irvine), wrote a book entitled “Free Speech on Campus.” In it, the authors seek to find a way to balance \"unfettered\" speech and at the same time promote \"inclusive environments\" on campus.\n\nI'm glad the professors believe in free speech, but they couldn't be more wrong about \"inclusive environments.\" First, inclusive environments aren't inclusive. Witness the inclusiveness dean shushing Sommers. Second, colleges were not, according to the idea of the university as it developed in western civilization, supposed to be \"inclusive\"; they were supposed to educate, which often meant exposing scholars to new ideas (and facts — remember those?).\n\nColleges have abandoned the project of exposing students to the poet Matthew Arnold's ideal of \"the best which has been thought and said.\" The result is that too many graduates are ignorant of the basics. You can't understand why free speech is important if your mind is unfurnished — or furnished with fact-free indoctrination picked up in a women's studies class or other class that concentrates mostly on grievances, real or imagined.\n\nIf, as Thomas Jefferson believed, education is the cornerstone of our democracy, we're in deep trouble.\n\nOf course, Mr. Jefferson would never be allowed on most American college campuses today.  \n\n_Charlotte Hays is senior editor and director of cultural program at Independent Women Forum._\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about fascism?","answers":[{"answer":"The article claims that the students are not refusing to grapple merely with ideas that are different from theirs but are ill-prepared to engage with ideas.

It was screened by the BBC in October 2003. It was filmed by Mark Daly, an investigative journalist, who joined the Greater Manchester Police Service and spent several months undercover at the Bruche National Training Centre in Warrington, Cheshire. He filmed episodes of racist behaviour among some recruits and their trainers.\n\n\nBruche National Training Centre\n\nBruche National Training Centre, Warrington, Cheshire, was operational between 1946 and May 2006. The facility provided initial training to new police officers.\n\n\nPolice training\n\nIn 2002, a “Training Matters Report” by Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary (HMI) indicated that police training was not fit for purpose.[2] The principal concern of the report was that police officers were not given enough training regarding the policing of diverse communities.[3] The report was influenced by the findings of the “Macpherson Report”.[4] The training of police officers had already begun a restructuring process prior to the broadcast of _The Secret Policeman._ The documentary sparked further restructuring which led to the Initial Police Learning and Development Programme (IPLDP), which was implemented by the Home Office in April 2005.[5]\n\n\nMacpherson Report\n\nThe initial scope of the Macpherson inquiry was the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993. However, it later expanded into a broader examination of racism within the police service, defining the term “institutional racism” as “the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people”.[6]\n\n\nThe documentary\n\nOn 27 January 2003, Mark Daly, an undercover journalist, joined the Greater Manchester Police Service (GMP) to investigate racism within the police service.[7] In the previous year, the Chief Constable had said that his police force was “institutionally racist”.[8] Most of the filming was completed during fifteen weeks of training at Bruche and it exposed racism among some of the police officers.[9] PC Rob Pulling from North Wales Police was captured on film stating that Stephen Lawrence “deserved it”, his parents were “spongers” and that the murders granted “diplomatic immunity”. He further stated that he would, “bury an Asian under the train track”.[10] Additionally, he wore a pillowcase over his head and pretended to be a member of the Ku Klux Klan.[11] Furthermore, he admitted to engaging in an unprovoked attack on an Asian man.[12] In addition to PC Pulling, the other police officers exposed during the filming were PC Keith Cheshire, North Wales Police,[13] PC Andy Hall, PC Carl Jones, PC Tony Lewin, PC Adrian Harrison, PC Andy Turley, GMP, and PC Steve Salkeld, Cheshire Police.[14] On 21 October 2003, the documentary was broadcast and made national headlines.[15] David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, and various senior police officers condemned the racist behaviour of the police officers exposed as a result of the documentary.[16] However, there were criticisms about the use of undercover journalism to study the topic.[17]\n\n\nResignations\n\nAfter the broadcast, ten police officers resigned, twelve police officers were disciplined and three police trainers were removed from their positions.[18]\n\n\nArrest of Mark Daly\n\nMark Daly continued as a police officer after his training at Bruche, and worked at the Hazel Grove Police Station in Stockport.[19] In August 2003, GMP received an anonymous tip-off about the documentary[20] and he was arrested on his way to work.[21] The GMP accused him of “obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception” because he had claimed a police-constable salary whilst working undercover.[22] The Crown Prosecution Service found that there was insufficient evidence to proceed with the prosecution.[23]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n","title":"The Secret Policeman"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story say about making the documentary The Secret Policeman?","answers":[{"answer":"As the title hints it, Mark Daly is the actor behind this documentary-he made the film while gaining experience with police forces in Manchester.

Shanahan denied the allegations. \"Though my marriage ended in sorrow and disappointment, I never laid a hand on my then-wife and cooperated fully in a thorough law enforcement investigation that resulted in her being charged with assault against me—charges which I had dropped in the interest of my family,” Shanahantold USA Today.\n\nThe Washington Postalso published a story Tuesday detailing other domestic violence incidents involving Shanahan's family, including how his son was arrested in 2011 after allegedly beating his mother with a baseball bat. The Post said Shanahan defended his son, saying at the time he acted in self-defense. Shanahan told the paper this week that resurfacing the incident “will ruin my son’s life,” while backing away from his original self-defense claim.\n\nWithout referencing the reporting, Trump announced on Twitter earlier Tuesday the acting secretary will not go forward with confirmation in order to focus on his family.\n\n“Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who has done a wonderful job, has decided not to go forward with his confirmation process so that he can devote more time to his family,” the president tweeted. “I thank Pat for his outstanding service and will be naming Secretary of the Army, Mark Esper, to be the new Acting Secretary of Defense. I know Mark, and have no doubt he will do a fantastic job!”\n\nEsper has served as secretary of the United States Army since 2017. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1986 — the same year as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nLast month, the White House announced Trump's intention to have Shanahan permanently lead the department, following his time serving as acting secretary. At the time, Shanahan said he was \"honored\" by Trump's decision.\n\n“If confirmed by the Senate, I will continue the aggressive implementation of our National Defense Strategy,\" he said. \"I remain committed to modernizing the force so our remarkable Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines have everything they need to keep our military lethal and our country safe.”\n\n[In this April 2, 2019, file photo, Secretary of the Army Mark Esper speaks during a House Armed Services Committee budget hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Fox News was told the panel was still waiting for paperwork from the FBI’s background check.\n\nShanahan worked at Boeing for over 30 years before coming to the Pentagon as then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’s deputy at the start of the Trump administration.

Tullibardine discussed how she was expendable to the Hamilton family's cause.[5]\n\nLater that month, he and William Kirkcaldy of Grange took ships and chased James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell to Shetland, but the earl escaped. Tullibardine continued the pursuit for a time.[6] Some of the ships came from Dundee, including the _James_, the _Primrose_, and the _Robert_.[7]\n\nAt the same time, his brother James Murray was made “customar” of Edinburgh, in place of James Curl, collecting taxes duties from merchants owed to the crown. Tullibardine was involved, requesting James Curl return some unlawfully impounded English cloth.[8]\n\nMurray's sister was the influential Annabell Murray, Countess of Mar (died February 1603), who was the keeper of the young James VI of Scotland at Stirling Castle. There was a story, promoted by the secretary of Mary, Queen of Scots, John Lesley, that the king found the “testament of Bothwell” in Tullibardine's papers in 1577 and was pleased to hear a story that showed his mother as innocent, for a change.\n\nOn 24 April 1579 the Earl of Atholl died shortly after attending a banquet at Stirling Castle. His wife Margaret Fleming, (who had been married to Murray's brother-in-law, Thomas Erskine, Master of Erskine), was also unwell. A rumour started that they had been poisoned.[9] Agnes Graham, the wife of William Murray of Tullibardine, wrote to Annabell Murray assuring her that the Countess of Atholl's complaints against her were “forged lies”.[10]\n\nHe was Comptroller of Scotland. He resigned the office in 1580 and James VI gave it to his son John.[11]\n\nHe died in 1583.\n\n\nFamily\n\nWilliam Murray married Agnes Graham, a daughter of William Graham, 2nd Earl of Montrose and Janet Keith.

He was the Governor of Southeast Sulawesi for twelve years between 1966 and 1978, and held acting governor positions in four other provinces due to his position in the Ministry of Home Affairs.\n\n\nEarly life\n\nSabara was born in Kendari, then part of Dutch East Indies, on 17 February 1927. His father was a municipal police officer. Sabara was the last of seven siblings, and he began his education in Kendari before moving to Makassar for further education until 1946, where he attended school with future Indonesian nationalist figure Robert Wolter Monginsidi.[1][2][3]\n\n\nCareer\n\nMilitary service\n\nAfter completing his education in Makassar, Sabara joined a group of youths from Sulawesi who left for Java to fight in the Indonesian National Revolution, as the South Sulawesi campaign of Raymond Westerling was raging in Makassar and its vicinity.[4][5] Once in Java, Sabara joined a battalion in the nationalist government, having been before grown an interest in the military due to watching KNIL drills as a child.[6] In 1948, he was a first lieutenant in command of a reserve company which was about to be deployed to Sulawesi when his unit was attacked and disarmed by Communist militias during the Madiun Affair. Sabara was imprisoned and was apparently about to be executed before Army units from the Siliwangi Division defeated the Communists and freed Sabara's unit.[7] During his time in Java, he also enrolled in the Magelang Military Academy.[8]\n\nAfter the revolution, he commanded units within the Hasanuddin Military Region, eventually becoming commander of its Regional Training Regiment by 1965. During his time at Hasanuddin, he participated in the campaign against Andi Aziz's rebellion. He had also commanded a reserve brigade during Operation Trikora in 1962.[9][10]\n\nGovernor and civil servant\n\nOn 14 October 1966, he was appointed as acting governor of Southeast Sulawesi, before being made full governor for two terms starting in 1967.[11][12] The previous civilian governor and the first elected governor of the province, La Ode Hadi, was forced to leave his position in 1966 before he had held it for two years following a wave of demonstrations during the transition to the New Order, allowing the popular Sabara (at that time a lieutenant colonel) to take over.[13]\n\nSoutheast Sulawesi was very sparsely populated at the start of his tenure, with little to no government budget, and Sabara opted to relocate locals (mostly nomadic farmers) alongside resettlement areas where roads were planned.[14] According to Sabara in a 1983 interview with _Tempo_, his wife initially believed that his appointment to Southeast Sulawesi was an exile of sorts.[15] He also drew in migrants from densely populated Java and Bali. Despite a lack of existing traffic at the time, he lobbied for the central government to fund key roads, especially between Kendari and Kolaka, believing that the road would attract agricultural settlers.[16] During his governorship, he also served in the People's Consultative Assembly as a regional representative.[17]\n\nHe was initially intended to serve just one term, and after its expiry in 1973 a lack of replacement candidates resulted in his term initially being extended by several months, and later a second term.[18] After the conclusion of his governorship in 1978, he was assigned in 1979 to the Ministry of Home Affairs as inspector general, and later became the director general of the ministry's regional autonomy directorate.[19] During his time there, he became acting governors for Jambi (1979),[20] Central Sulawesi (25 November 1980 – 1981),[21] and Aceh (15 March – 27 August 1981),[22] During his temporary governorships of Aceh and Central Sulawesi, he had encountered political gridlocks in the provincial legislatures during their attempt to appoint a definitive governor.[23]\n\nIn 27 October 1981, he was also again appointed acting governor of Southeast Sulawesi, the eighth time he was sworn in as Governor.[24][25][26] Afterwards, he was once more appointed as acting governor of Central Kalimantan (7 October 1983 – 23 January 1984).[27] Due to this track record, he was known by journalists as being the “acting governor specialist” in the early 1980s.[28][29] During his time in the ministry, he also revived the deputy governor position, based on his own experience as governor where a lack of a deputy often caused issues especially with the provincial legislature.[30] He was awarded with the Star of Mahaputera, 3rd class (_Bintang Mahaputera Utama_) during his time as inspector general.[31] In 1984, he was also appointed into the Supreme Advisory Council.[32]\n\nHe died in September 1995, due to his heart disease and kidney-related complications. He was buried in Jakarta.[33] At the time of his death, he held the rank of major general.[34]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n\n[27] \n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] \n\n[31] \n\n[32] \n\n[33] \n\n[34] \n","title":"Eddy Sabara"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about Sabara's dictatorial tendencies?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"Empty response.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null},{"question":"Summarize Sabara's military duties.","answers":[{"answer":"Sabara was a first lieutenant in command of a reserve company when he was attacked and disarmed by Communist militias during the Madiun Affair.

He graduated in 2011 and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2012.[9] In 2014, he became Head of the MMA Surgery Department. In the same year, he became Deputy Head of the Academy. Since 2015, he has been Professor of Surgery.[10]\n\nSince 2017, Mutafchiyski has been acting as the Head of the Military Medical Academy. On 7 February 2018, by decree of the President of the Republic of Bulgaria and with order by the Minister of Defense was appointed Chief of the MMA and Chief Doctor of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria.[11] On 6 May 2019, by decree of the President of Bulgaria was conferred the highest rank of Major General.[12]\n\n\nFamily\n\nMutafchiyski is married. His wife Elena is a psychiatrist and they have twin sons Mark and Alexander (born 1994). Both sons graduated in the United Kingdom, Mark in Economics and Alexander in Law.[13]\n\n\nChairman of the National Crisis Management Staff\n\nAfter the outbreak of the COVID–19 pandemic in the country, Mutafchiyski was appointed Chairman of the National Crisis Management Staff on 24 February 2020.[14] The general started holding daily briefings where he reads out statistical updates and takes questions from reporters. He quickly became popular and is arguably the public figure most closely associated with the fight against the pandemic in the country.[15]\n\nMutafchiyski has been consistently advocating the need for social distancing as the only proven measure that can slow the spread of the coronavirus and prevent a collapse of the healthcare system.[16] As early as 13 March 2020, he stated “The key word for all measures is social distancing and self-isolation”.[17] On 10 April 2020, he was worried that “there were bunches of 7-8 people on the streets” and has linked this to a spike in infections the following week.[18][19] Because the Bulgarian government did not officially shut down church services as done in neighboring Balkan countries, Mutafchiyski watched the Easter services only on TV, and was pleased that social distancing measures and the low attendance were sufficient to prevent the churches from becoming a source of contagion, despite reports that the number of people attending the Alexander Nevsky liturgy alone were in the hundreds.[20] His expectations were for another spike in infections related to increased inter-city travel during the Easter holidays.[21]\n\nOn 1 May 2020, the general was hailed as a hero by _Le Temps_ for handling the pandemic in Bulgaria, despite critical attitudes on his decisions in Bulgarian media,[22] and was highly praised for refusing to report discriminatory ethnic statistics against the Roma minority of Bulgarian citizens.[23]\n\n\nMilitary missions\n\n-   2000 Radusha Refugee Camp, North Macedonia[24][25]\n\n&nbsp;\n-   2003 Medical evacuation of victims of the terrorist attack in Kerbala, Iraq[26][27]\n\n&nbsp;\n-   2004 (January) Medical evacuation of the victims of the terrorist act in Kerbala from Landstuhl Hospital, Germany to the Military Medical Academy, Sofia[28][29]\n\n&nbsp;\n-   2004 (May) Medical evacuation of servicemen from Landstuhl Hospital, Germany to Military Medical Academy, Sofia[30][31]\n\n&nbsp;\n-   2006–2007 Surgeon at the Spanish Military Field Hospital, Arena Base, Herat, Afghanistan[32][33]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n\n[27] \n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] \n\n[31] \n\n[32] \n\n[33] \n","title":"Ventsislav Mutafchiyski"},"questions":[{"question":"What is the role of Ventsislav Mutafchiyski in the Covid-19 pandemic?","answers":[{"answer":"He is the Head of the National Operational Headquarters for Fight with Coronavirus Pandemic in Bulgaria.","critiques":[{"critique":"Doesn't mention that he is also the Director of MMA.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention his role as Chairman of the National Crisis Management Staff.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"Doesn't mention his role as Chairman of the National Crisis Management Staff.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"This requires more context to be provided.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer could be more specific about what his role is.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"\"He is the Head of the National Operational Headquarters for Fight with Coronavirus Pandemic in Bulgaria.\" - add that he is also the Director of the Military Medical Academy.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,0,0,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null}]}}

He had a look of anticipation, as if he was waiting for some pain relieving gossip. \n\n“I was home,” I responded innocently before he rolled his eyes at me. “Now, don’t bother me, I’m trying to focus.” Although normally I would use anything to distract me from school, I wasn’t about to involve Max in last night’s mess.\n\n“Are you expecting me to believe you weren’t at Nina’s party?” He raised his eyebrows at me. I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me. Perhaps I couldn’t fix her parent’s divorce, but I could at least attend her house party. Especially after her break up with Todd, the leather jacket douche that called her “babe” so much I would wonder if he knew her real name.\n\n“I promise you’ll have a great time,” Nina had told me. And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle. Something nostalgic about repetitive rap songs preaching about the wonders of big asses. \n\nEverything seemed normal at first. The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room. I could feel the air thickening. \n\nMinutes before terror, I was standing unnoticed next to a group of girls I recognized. \n\n“Someone told me her dad was abusive,” I heard one say with wide eyes. \n\n“Yeah, apparently the neighbors called the cops on them,” another responded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t point fingers just yet. Nina’s mom’s a bitch. Maybe she deserved it,” a brunette shrugged and took a sip of her drink right before our eyes met. Her face flared red as she realized her words had been overhead. I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry. A millisecond later, I spotted Nina on the floor. Hands covering her face in defense. The lack of light in the room didn’t stop the fierceness of her blood as it dripped down her temple and into her hair. \n\nI stood still. My brain called in fear but my body made no response. Not even when Todd walked passed me, into the hallway and shut the door behind him. \n\nNina remained on the floor. She held herself and rocked back and forth, letting silent cries out into the thick air. \n\n“Don’t tell anyone.” She whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” Max snapped at me. “Are you going to tell me or not?” I stared at him blankly as the vivid flashbacks flew through my head. My heart stung in bitterness as I recognized that all I wanted to do was say it.

The cats eyes go back and forth, but they're always watching me. From the kitchen, to the living room, and though the walls seperate us, I can feel it watching in the bathroom. Shampoo bottles half empty, my blow dryer and bubble bath. I don't need these things, but I need to take them. I picked a few empty boxes from the grocery nearby, but havent filled up one yet.\n\nTick....Tick...\n\nIf I just sit on the floor..no, if I lay actually, I can see the colors of the curtains and couches swirling around. I'm not high yet, nothing to drink this early, and still I'm spinning. I want to rip the books off of the shelf and hurl them at the TV, but then I won't have the white noise. Maury or something is playing, they're about to find out if some guy is the father to a child of a loud woman. I hope he's not. \n    If I get up now, and start collecting and packing, I'll likely feel a sense of accomplishment, that's what I've been primed to believe, but what really will be done? I'll have moved on from a place of comfort, even if it has grown less familiar. I'll be carrying my things, physical and emotional, from block to block, searching for a new place to put down my baggage. Who does that help, and what does it accomplish? \n    Maybe I'll just leave it all. Who needs these things; pots and pans, frilly curtains and polished oak poles. If I'd spent less time picking them out, maybe I wouldn't feel so conflicted. What do I need from here anymore, and what did I need from here to begin with? I'm wondering if I ever felt truly at home here, or if I bought these accessories to distract myself from an empty feeling I've always had inside these walls. \n\nTick....Tick...\n\nIf I step onto the balcony and look below, I can see the flower garden meant to be cared for by this floor, the apartments above and below, and mine. A bare area in the middle where I got lazy, or apathetic, or forgetful. I don't remember the last time I planted something, and It's harder to remember if it was out of a gradual lack of interest, or if there was a clear and defined event that curbed my desire to make the patch of earth I was responsible for a nicer and more beautiful thing to see and touch. I normally have an ashtray, but I think It's in one of the boxes now, so It can't hurt too much to flick one cigarette off the porch, just this time. \n    I've been avoiding our room. I can't be in there, I keep thinking. It's too hard, I keep saying. I wonder though if I feel ashamed, or If I feel betrayed. I don't know why he did it, but I wonder if it was my fault. Maybe I wasn't loving enough, or maybe I was distracted dwelling in my dark times and failed to see his. I've been told before about the distraction. My parents, my friends, I'm always reffered to as if I'm empty headed, or just careless to others feeling. Maybe I am? Is this an opportunity to work on a bad habit and salvage future relationships? Should I take the plates and silverware? I could just buy more, but I did pick these out specifically because they matched our dining room walls and table. If I find myself lying on the floor again, does that say something about my desire to take what's mine anymore? What is mine, anymore?\n\nTick....\n\nI think I should just leave this place behind and move on, to something scary and brand new and different. Maybe I should change my hair, my name, throw out all of my clothes and start a new life. I'm lost, but still alive. I'll leave these possessions, and the boxes, and just walk east. \n    I will walk into our room one last time, and say goodbye, and kiss his forehead. That at the very least will save me from worrying about taking my red lipstick, and I may as well leave the rest of my makeup too. The clock is still watching though, so perhaps I'll just send a postcard from my new life.\n    \n'Love From Sunny Somewhere, Wish You Were Here!'\n\n\nAnd I do, wish you were here. Just like I know I'll wish you were with me anywhere I go. I can't pretend things are a certain way anymore though, just like I know now you couldn't. \nSo If I just leave it all behind, what will be waiting for me outside?\n    The trees and sidewalks, the birds and buses, all with purpose, ill defined, with expectations just like mine. Dependent on the will of other people to make our purpose known, and weak enough to be benign as soon as others cease to use us. \n\nSo I do, leave the boxes, but I think I'll take that fucking clock.","title":"[MF] How Small We Are"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story say about the theme of moving on?","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator is moving out of their apartment and thinks about the things they will take with them.

That was my mother’s mantra. She said it after every hard shift, every failed test, every break up, and every argument. She whispered it into my ears as she wiped tears off my cheeks. I used to tell myself the same thing when things went awry. I had always put faith into words, especially those words. Words defined my life.\nIt was 4:15 in the morning on the sixteenth of July. There was nothing special about the time or the date, but my brain woke me up regardless. I remember how cold it was in my room. I reached out of bed, tapped the small touch lamp on the bedside table, grabbed the robe that hung off the post of my bed and buried myself inside of it. Sliding my feet into my slippers, I crossed the room to turn on my space heater.\n\n\nHad I lived anywhere else, the heater probably would’ve been stored away with holiday decorations and winter jackets, but I didn’t live anywhere else. I lived in a studio apartment with very little space. I didn’t own any holiday decorations and all of my winter clothes were hung up and stuffed into my little closet behind all of my summer clothes. I crossed the room and turned the knob on my fourteen dollar space heater to the single notch that signified power level one. The lamp lost a little bit of light. I shuffled toward my bed, kicked off the slippers and did a belly flop onto the mattress. The room filled with the quiet hum of the heater converting the temperature of the air and I squirmed under the comforter. Laying in my bed, wrapped in a robe and snuggled under a blanket, I knew I wasn’t getting back to sleep that night. I had only slept for about three hours and already my brain had kicked me into consciousness and given me the finger. I laid there for a few minutes and decided, ’Fuck it. If I’m going to be awake, I’m going to work’. I grabbed the laptop from the other side of the end table, nearly knocking the lamp off as I did. I pushed the lamp back into place, increasing its brightness ever so slightly. I flipped the laptop open and was greeted by a page full of text.\n\n\nWords had always comforted me. Growing up, my mother always knew exactly what to say to make things better. She had so many pearls of wisdom to hand out and I had always eagerly accepted them. It had just been her and I growing up. After I was born, the doctor told her she wouldn’t have any more children. Her husband, who I refused to acknowledge as being my father (why should I, I never even saw his face), couldn’t stand to be with a woman who couldn’t provide him with a son so he left her with her daughter without a trace. Kids at school were always kind enough to point out how weird it was that Lindsay didn’t have a dad and when I would report their observations to my mother, she would always get down on her knees, put her hands on my shoulders and ask me, “Are those children smarter than you?” to which I always replied, “No”. Her follow up would be something similar to “Are the girls prettier than you?” This question had bothered me because I looked nothing like my mother (which, naturally, meant that I looked like her ex-husband). But, in the end, the answer was usually “No”. She would ask if they were stronger or braver than me and, as the queen of dares and arm wrestling, I always responded in the negative. She would wrap all of these questions up with one final one, the only one that really mattered.\n\n\n“So then, Lindsay, are the kids with fathers better than you?”\n\n\nAnd I always knew they weren’t. There were some kids in town that were, but they all went to a private school and I never had to see them anyway. I went to the only public school in my town. Everyone knew everyone else and we were all poor. No one had a guest bedroom and most of the houses had only one bathroom. My mom worked as a nurse during the day at the local nursing home and bartended during the night. She was always home when I woke up, when school let out, and when I went to sleep. As soon as I was old enough, I got a job helping out at the library after school. I got lost in books and excelled in English and ended up writing my way out of that little town and into Chicago. I took my mother with me, but she didn’t make it very long in a big city. She was exceedingly proud of my success but I always told her that she was the one who had given it to me.\n\n\nI opened the laptop to find a page mostly filled with words. They were small money words. I hadn’t produced big money words since my mother died. I watched the cursor blink, waiting to be jettisoned across the screen by a slew of creativity or inspiration but it just stood there and blinked at me. I was in the middle of reading the paragraph preceding the boring cursor when I heard a rattling outside of my bedroom. My brain shut down and I stared at my bedroom door, waiting to see if it would bust inward. Someone was in my apartment. I knew that because the closest I came to a pet was the plastic tree by the front door and the dead fern by the window. I remember thinking ’Who the fuck would break in to my shitty apartment?’ but that didn’t matter. What mattered was that somebody had. My lamp was on and my laptop was illuminating my room, so whoever it was probably knew that I was awake.

Her father, Stiles Richard Dodson, was the son of Richard Dodson and Hannah Watson, being a descendant of Thomas and Mary Dodson, of whom the doctor's mother was also a descendant. Her mother, Mrs. Caroline Matilda (née Harrison) Dodson, was the daughter of Stephen Harrison, and Mary Dodson. Miss Dodson's father and mother were natives of Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania and married in 1836. Her mother was Mrs. C. Matilda Dodson About six weeks after marriage, they left Pennsylvania for the West and settled in Van Buren County, Iowa. Stiles R. Dodson died in 1847, leaving his widow with four daughters, the youngest less than two years of age. Her sisters were named Melvina (d. 1862), Mary, and Susan. That winter, the mother taught school in her own house. In the spring of 1848, she returned with her family to her father's house in Pennsylvania. Caroline was baptized in November, 1857, and thereafter, she was a member of the Baptist church.\n\nStudy at home under private teachers and at the district school supplemented the early lessons from the mother. At about twelve, she was sent to an academy and normal institute. She began to teach in the winter of 1861. Returning at intervals to school, she followed the profession of teaching until the fall of 1871 when she matriculated at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, and entered upon the three-year course just inaugurated. Dr. Ann Preston was then Dean. The summer of 1872, she spent in the Nurses' Training School of the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia. The course required was completed and Dodson received a certificate of the Training School for Nurses. The summer of 1873, she spent in the same hospital as student in the wards and out practice. She received her diploma in March, 1874, and went to Ypsilanti, Michigan, for further study with Dr. Ruth A. Gerry, one of the first women to practice medicine.\n\n\nCareer\n\nAfter a year spent in hospital and private practice with Gerry, Dodson went to Rochester, New York, and there, in connection with a practice, opened a drug store. In 1877, her mother having gone West again, Dodson started for Iowa, going by the Hudson and Great Lakes. She lost a car load of valuables in the riot at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter her trip West, she returned to Philadelphia and worked at whatever appeared to be profitable. For a time, she depended upon per week to meet the living expenses of three in her family, but offers came, and among them, unsolicited, one from the Philadelphia Society for Organizing Charity to act as superintendent of one of its districts. Dodson accepted the position, and for eight years, filled it in connection with her private practice of medicine.\n\nNational Woman's Health Association of America\n\nAs a teacher, she wrote and spoke boldly for better methods of education, and advocated broadening the opportunities for study. She saw that a general movement might help to educate the masses and to spread a knowledge of self-care. To this end, after much deliberation, a call was issued for a public meeting to be held in Association Hall, Philadelphia, July 23, 1890, and an organization was effected under the name of the National Woman's Health Association of America. The association was chartered November 1, 1890. and Dodson was elected first president. The plan of the association was broad and provided for extensive work. Its objective was to bring the medical profession into closer relation with the general public by the discussion of health topics.\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nDodson read widely on subjects concerning the movements of women, speaking and writing in their interest. In 1888, at the 19th annual convention of the Pennsylvania Woman's Suffrage Association, Dodson's missionary work was noted in laudatory terms.[1]\n\nDodson founded the Baptist Sisterhood in Philadelphia.[2] She died at her home in Philadelphia, January 9, 1898, of sarcoma.[3]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n","title":"Caroline Matilda Dodson"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize Caroline's life during the 1910s.","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"It is omitted that Caroline Matilda Dodson died in January 9, 1898, of sarcoma.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"No answer","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"No response is given for the 1910s.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"This answer is incorrect and needs to be rewritten.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"No answer.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The question can be answered.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null},{"question":"Summarize everything relating to Caroline's mother.

He walked into the room trying to assess his surroundings quickly while still maintaining his composure. The room was medium sized. Guards flanked the doors and lined the walls. The table in the center contained a machine, placed in front of its terrified operator, and wires leading towards--Daniel heard the door lock behind him, sealing him in with that ... _thing_. The creature lay in the center of the room, its presence consuming and demanding. It did nothing to warrant this attention, it lacked even the slightest hint of movement, yet it commanded the attention of every human. Daniel approached the table.\n\nHis steps reverberated throughout the room, cleaving the silence.\n\nEach step brought discomfort.\n\nDaniel hid is unease.\n\nHe wore his face like a mask.\n\nBut, his eyes tore the room apart instinctively, looking for separation.\n\nYet, he continued forward.\n\nDaniel closed the distance between him and the thing until he was close enough to look down upon it.\n\nHe dragged the chair back. There was a sigh of relief in the room as the sound put an end to the silence. The guards readjusted their weapons; the operator began to fiddle with his equipment; and the thing … rippled. Perhaps it was a welcoming-- Daniel sneered, or a challenge. Daniel looked at the operator who continued to nervously fiddle with his equipment in a transfixed manner.\n\nDaniel quickly lifted his briefcase onto the table, unconsciously determined to keep the silence at bay. The briefcase opened with a satisfying click. He spread the pages across his end of the table. He hadn’t even had time to read up on the literature before he was rushed here, so he slowly began to rustle through the documents one by one.\n\nIn one of the dossiers, Daniel saw pictures of the thing taken a few hours ago when it had first arrived. It looked ... different. Daniel dared a glance at the thing. It was duller now, more opaque, than it was in the photos. Its “flaps” and “fins” drooped, and its entire body looked like it was being compressed and squashed against the table. It reminded him of melted ice cream. Daniel’s stomach churned and he looked back down towards the reports. He only scanned the next fifty pages. In total, the reports said nothing about it in thousands of words. It was an enigma and unlike anything else.  He was the first. He had his shot before even the scientists could get their hands on it. He didn’t know whether to feel honored or terrified. \n\nDaniel noticed a slight noise coming from the receiver on the table. Grimacing, Daniel picked up the receiver and placed it in his ear. He disliked this but it was “standard” procedure.\n\n“What do you think you’re doing?” a voice demanded.\n\nDaniel did not recognize the voice but it was filled with an arrogance that enraged him. Daniel turned his steely gaze towards one of the cameras.\n\n“I assume you’d like me to know what it is exactly that I’m doing sir. Perhaps next time you should give me more time to read th--“\n\n“Colonel Lehmann! You were sent to communicate with the threat and decide the best course of action. Now if you are incapable of this very simple task you will be relieved. Understood?”  That was the Secretary of Defense. How many bureaucrats hid in the shadows, watching with safety behind their cameras and walls? If you turned on a light would they scatter…?\n\n“Crystal,” said Daniel.\n\nHe slid his papers away, clearing the field. He looked back at the thing’s side. It seemed even duller than the last time he had looked but he couldn’t be sure. Daniel nodded to the operator and received a shaky thumbs-up.\n\nThey were good to go. “Why are you here?” Daniel inquired.\n\nThe machine began to beep as the operator quickly worked on deciphering each letter into dots and dashes. Finally the operator slumped back into his seat. He fidgeted with items near him to occupy himself until it answered--if it answered.\n\nDaniel felt the hairs on his neck rise and tasted ozone. There was a sharp crack as the operator dropped his pencil. Daniel looked around to see that the guards had raised their weapons slightly and the operator was stiff with his eyes staring straight out, staring slightly past the thing, like a deer caught in headlights. They sensed it too. The machine began to hiss with static. Then the voices began, like several people speaking at once, not fighting for air but sharing it.\n\n“We are here as messengers,” the voices said.\n\nThen the bureaucrats began. It started with disconcerted mumbling occasionally loud enough to be transmitted and then broke out into yelling and arguments. Daniel rubbed his temples. They were already at each other’s throats. Doing his best to ignore the receiver, Daniel glanced around the room admiring the unflinching guards. They held their weapons with a trained ease, confident in the superiority they provided. But in such a case as this, could they really be sure?\n\n“What do you mean by “we?” Daniel said.\n\n“Those who stand before you and those we represent.”\n\nThe thing’s--perhaps things’-- antennae gave a lazy dismissive flick. Could it really be multiple creatures?\n\n“What are you?”\n\n“There is no auditory representation of us. You may choose your own.”\n\n“How many of you are here?”\n\n“Just us.” The thing began to ripple more erratically. “We do not have time for this.”\n\nDaniel leaned forward, “What is your message?”\n\n“End all emission of electrical signals--immediately.”\n\nThe noise from the receiver broke into a roar. The bureaucrats knew exactly what was at stake. Economies would be crippled. Society and development would be flung decades back. Preventing a few people out of seven billion from using electrical signals is infeasible. Most importantly, even if it were possible, reelection after implementing such a procedure would not be.\n\n“You want us to turn off all our wireless transmissions?”\n\nThe creature … expanded. “Yes.”\n\n“We cannot.” Even with the continuous yelling, the humans listening in seemed to agree on this much. Daniel waited for the operator to transmit his message. He was slow in doing so, and his actions and responses were slurred like a man in daze.\n\nBefore the operator had transmitted the message, the static hissed from the machine again, causing the operator to nearly leap backwards into the arms of one of the guards.\n\n“Why?!”\n\nDaniel nearly flinched. His heartbeat quickened and he had to forcefully pace himself. In an effort to mask his unease he nonchalantly motioned for someone to bring him water. Daniel turned his impassive face towards the thing again with renewed hostility. \n\n “We do not trust you.” He heard the bureaucrats murmur an agreement--the stars must have been aligned. \n\nThe fins rippled and groups of voices took turns to speak, “Your emissions are a beacon, a beacon that could lead them to us or yourselves. They are close. And if they find you, they will destroy us all.”\n\n“Who are they?”\n\n“Nomads. Parasites. Conquerors. If they find you it will only be a matter of time before you reveal us. You _must_ stop”\n\n \nAdditional Info: This was originally a homework assignment. It's been long since completed and submitted and I wish to continue it for my own benefit. However, I feel like I hit a wall in the writing and can't continue. I want the encounter to end with hostility but I cannot get it to unfold in such a manner.

For one, 2017 turned out to be a much better year for the global economy than had been anticipated.\n\nGlobal growth was a healthy 3.5% and well distributed across the world. Stock markets were on a tear, including here in India, clocking returns not seen since the halcyon pre-financial crisis days. While there has been a lot of talk about ‘economic nationalism’, nothing fundamentally changed in the global order.\n\nThe conversation at Davos is likely to be more optimistic than it has been in the last few years. This year’s theme is ‘Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World’.\n\nThe first subagenda, the ‘Global Agenda’, seeks to support efforts to improve global governance mechanisms and advance major multilateral processes, such as the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. The ‘Geopolitical Agenda’ seeks to improve the adaptation to change by global leaders. The ‘Economic Agenda’ will focus on supporting sustainable and inclusive economic development, while the ‘Regional Agenda’ will examine the social and economic transformations occurring across the world.\n\nIn the ‘Industry and Business Agenda’, participants will contribute to the shaping of new industry ecosystems and help industry and government leaders prepare for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Finally, in the ‘Future Agenda’, attendees will share ideas, innovations and discoveries that will have a global impact.\n\nAbout 3,000 business leaders, 350 high-ranking officials, including 60 Heads of State and Government, will participate in the four-day forum. The presence of US President Donald Trump has created unprecedented media attention. There will also be French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nFor India, this year will be even more important due to the participation of the Indian PM after 20 years. For Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there are two clear agenda points. The first is to continue to aggressively promote India as an investment destination. We need much more investment, and what better forum than Davos with its high concentration of global CEOs, investors and influencers to make a pitch.\n\nThe ‘Make in India’ campaign needs to be re-energised for better results. There is much for the PM to tout as far as his economic track record is concerned, not least of which is the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the sound macro fundamentals, the resolution of non-performing assets (NPAs), the structural reforms of specific sectors, and the positive outlook for faster growth. India continues to be the fastest growing large economy in the world with increasing consumer demand.\n\nThe PM will need to nudge foreign investors further in that direction. At Davos, he has to be India’s marketing chief. The second agenda for Modi will be to lay out India’s position in this ever-changing world, and his personal views as the prime representative of a sixth of humanity. Are we willing to shelve the shibboleths of the past – India’s ‘socialist’ orientation, the vestiges of our ‘non-alignment’, our aloofness from global trade and investment, and our ‘difficulties’ in doing business -- and boldly take the lead, especially as the US vacates leadership space and China rushes in to fill the vacuum?\n\nIn such a context, the world will be comparing and contrasting the positions of Xi Jinping from last year’s forum -- where the Chinese premier appeared willing to take on leadership for an open global order and made quite a splash in doing so -- with the vision that Modi will present.\n\nThe PM is likely to use the Davos platform to state India’s views on this emerging new world order. India has also taken a strong domestic position on climate change. But combating climate change needs constant leadership and the world needs to be shepherded along in that direction. India can take the lead in this area and Modi can put his weight behind it. So this year, Davos will move the global agenda forward.\n\n_THE WRITER IS CHAIRMAN-CEO, RENEW POWER AND WILL BE AT DAVOS 2018_\n\n(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

And all of you, you members of Congress and senators just shut up and stay off of TV if you have any shred of morality left — especially if you have refused to vote for gun control.\n\nSeventeen innocent, frightened students and staff were shot dead in a public high school and how does our President respond? He tweets. \"My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.\"\n\nReally? Then ban assault weapons. Then stop telling everyone that the terrorists are coming, the terrorists are coming when the terrorists are here and they are us. WE kill one another by the thousands and thousands in more than one mass shooting every single day in this country.\n\nWe don't want your prayers. What we want from you right now is to ban assault weapons; we want you to make it impossible for civilians to have AR-15s. Period.

(Mike Stocker/AP)\n\nIf you are such God-fearing, God-loving people, you'd put the Sixth Commandment before the Second Amendment.\n\nRonald Reagan, your hero, believed in banning assault weapons.\n\nToday, incredibly, marks the 18th school shooting since the first of the year. That's one school shooting every 2.5 days. How is it possible that American public schools are now among the most dangerous places on the planet?\n\nParents now know that each time they put their children on the school bus, they may in fact be putting them in harm's way. They could be sending their own children into what was a formerly safe place, but is now a place where their kids have targets on the heads, kids who could very well be trapped and killed by a lunatic armed with an easily acquired assault weapon.\n\nIn fact, today's killer, Nikolas Cruz, a former student, showed his cache of weapons to other students. Everyone knew he had guns. They kicked him out of school but no one took his guns away.\n\nHell, taking guns away is UnAmerican.\n\n[President Trump tweets regarding the school shooting.]\n\nPresident Trump tweets regarding the school shooting. (Twitter)\n\nYes, there have always been lunatics and troubled teens. But they didn't have assault weapons.

How is that possible? It's possible because our legislators won't even ban the popular mass killer gun, the AR-15. They are legal in the United States. Legal.\n\n[Why hasn't our cowardly President banned assault weapons?]\n\nWhy hasn't our cowardly President banned assault weapons?

You elected officials won’t even pass a bill to keep people on the watchlist from buying guns. You want everyone to have the right to open carry.

The game was briefly released before its official release date on the Nintendo Switch eShop on March 26, 2020,[1] but was taken down just a few hours later due to legal issues between the publisher, Planet Entertainment, and the owner of the _Cooking Mama_ intellectual property (IP), Office Create. The fact that the game released without a public announcement or press statement and was taken down so quickly has led to much speculation about the game's development and if the game will be properly released.[2] The game was then officially released on March 31 in the United States despite legal concerns, but the European and Australian releases were delayed to April 28.[3] Office Create publicly issued a statement condemning the breach of contract on April 15, 2020. However, the European and Australian releases were not impacted and released as normal.\n\nThe game is the first main entry in the _Cooking Mama_ series since 2014's _Cooking Mama 5: Bon Appétit!_, and the first _Cooking Mama_ game on console since 2008's _Cooking Mama: World Kitchen_. A PlayStation 4 version was also announced with the game's initial announcement in August 2019 with a planned April 28, 2020 release, but has not released or been advertised by Planet Entertainment since.\n\n\nGameplay\n\n_Cooking Mama: Cookstar_ plays similarly to previous entries in the series. New in _Cookstar_ is the introduction of a vegetarian mode, as well as the ability to share photos of completed recipes on social media. The former was praised by PETA, which had criticized previous _Cooking Mama_ games for having few vegan recipes.[4]\n\n\nDevelopment\n\n_Cookstar_ was initially revealed as _Cooking Mama: Coming Home to Mama_ in August 2019, with an estimated release date for Q3 of that year. Its publisher claimed that it was the first implementation of blockchain technology on a major video game console, using the technology to implement a form of digital rights management.[5] The game was developed by American[6] studio 1st Playable Productions, but the company later removed all mentions of the game from its website.[7]\n\n\nRelease\n\n_Cookstar_ ostensibly released on March 31, 2020. The game was briefly made available on the Nintendo Switch eShop, but pulled shortly after its release.[8] Additionally, the PlayStation 4 version was never released despite being listed on several storefronts. Unconfirmed rumors that the game acted as a cryptocurrency miner emerged shortly after its release.[9] 1st Playable responded that the implementation of blockchain technology was only “hypothetical” and explained that the game's removal from Nintendo eShop was due to an ongoing legal dispute between the publisher Planet Entertainment and IP rights holder Office Create.[10] Office Create stated it has started taking legal action against Planet as they had terminated their license to use _Cooking Mama_ on March 30, 2020, after which Planet had started selling the game.[11]\n\n\nReception\n\n_Cooking Mama: Cookstar_ received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nTravis Northup of _IGN_ gave the game 3 out of 10, praising the detailed recipes featured in the game, but criticizing the monotonous gameplay, poor motion controls, “nightmarish” voice acting, and lack of meaningful progression. He also noted that the game does not offer anything new compared to past entries, which combined with the flaws, make _Cookstar_ a “tedious game that does almost nothing well.”[12]\n\nConversely, TheGamer's Bella Blondeau gave _Cookstar_ a 4 out of 5. She praised the game's variety and amount of content, as well as the “nuance” to mastering the mechanics. In addition, she praised the game's photo mode and Yoko Nishino's “charming” performance as Mama, stating that the character felt “like a tangible, adorable dork of a mother.”[13]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n","title":"Cooking Mama: Cookstar"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about the gameplay of \"Cooking Mama: Cookstar\"?","answers":[{"answer":"\"Cooking Mama: Cookstar\" plays similarly to previous installments of the series.

He was also a nephew of George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, head of the family.[1]\n\nThe young Curzon was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, commissioned into the Royal Scots Greys, and saw active service in the final months of the First World War, in France and Belgium, then after the Armistice of November 1918 in Germany, Egypt, Syria, and Palestine. In 1923, he was appointed as Honorary Attaché to the British embassy in Rome.[2] [Kedleston Hall] His uncle's marriage had produced only three daughters, and he was widowed in 1906, leaving Curzon's father as the heir presumptive to the family estates based on Kedleston Hall in Derbyshire and the peerage of Baron Scarsdale.[3] His uncle was also given other peerages, and in 1911 was created Viscount Scarsdale, with a special remainder to his father and his father's heirs male.

I know a lot of you are attached to the gift exchange, but I think this year we should try something new.

But maybe we should just do our charity on our own. A lot of us like the gift exchange.\" Tim said, fighting back the anger at the idea of being made to give to charity. Tim was a conservative in the sense that he conserved most of his emotions for blowing way the fuck up at small slights he felt were forced on him. \n\n\"Tim, Christmas is about giving - not taking. Why don't we go the extra mile here and -\" But Diane was cut off mid sentence by \n\nJessica! \"Christmas? Christmas? Is this 1960? Are we on the set of Mad Men?

Or wash my hands EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I. USE. THE. BATHROOM!\"\n\nEveryone stopped and looked around at each other and then at Tim. \"You don't always wash your hands? Gross.\" Diane made a face. She had stopped weeping and found a new charity - the one where you give ridicule. \"Tim doesn't wash his hands!\"\n\nEveryone started laughing. \n\nI looked around and there was a general sense of togetherness, something that religions, charities, and politicians cannot put together. Something stronger. Something beautiful. It was the act of not being the person being made fun of.\n\nTim looked around the room and finding no clear target for his rage, decided to punch the coffee maker and then he stormed out as laughter followed him down the halls. \n\nFinally, the room composed itself and Diane began again. \"OK. I'm not feeling a lot of love for the charity. So, let's go ahead and just do our gift exchange, at a restaurant, like usual.\" She smiled at the group.\n\n\"What restaurant?\"\n\nAnd with that, chaos ensued. Employees shot from their chairs and grabbed whatever was nearby and began pummeling their neighbor. \n\n\"Outback!\" \n\n\"Red Robin!\"\n\n\"Ninos!\" \n\n...were the battle cries that day. I hid under a desk and watched Diane use a letter opener to stab Jane in the ear repeatedly. The idea of charity was long gone and she only craved the sound of metal plunging into brain. \n\nJon was trying to fit Harry down the garbage chute, Becka was strangling Don with a phone cord, Thom was in the corner raping a fern for reasons unknown...\n\nThe battle went on and I was able to ride it out under my desk smoking cigarettes and drinking mini bottles of Rum that I had received at the last Peace in the Middle East and End Smoking lunch.\n\nFinally, a champion appeared. It was Ruth. She was dragging Michael X's body on a cross she had made from the cubicle uprights. The rest of the employees were dead, dying, or too injured to protest when Ruth, bloodied, stood on her desk and proclaimed \"We shall have a white elephant gift exchange. At Denny's. We will call it a Seasonal Party. We will wear ugly...ugly...sweaters...\" and then she gasped and fell to the ground dead.\n\nThe only sound was Thom continuing to have sex with a fern.\n\nI slowly walked out.

No animals lived in the forest, &amp; one ever entered the forest. It remained silent &amp; still for eons. \nThat is of course, until one rainy night. A raindrop, just like any other raindrop, hit the ground. More &amp; more raindrops fell, and a puddle appeared. From the puddle, a small, chubby hand reached out. It grabbed the dirt &amp; pulled itself out. The small hand was attracted to a young girl. \nShe blinked. \nIn front of her stood thin, spindly trees. They were golden, like the harp strings whom’s music echos faintly in her mind.\nSilence &amp; rain. \nNo more rain. \nSilence.\nA flash of white fur struck the corner of her eye. \nSuddenly there in front of her stood a stag. \n\n“Hello?” The little girl trembled. \nThe stag stood watching. Then, it lowered it’s head. It’s eyes were as black as obsidian. \nIt placed it’s head in her arms. “I made you, &amp; I will keep you safe.” The stag said, “I love you very much.” \n\n“What is your name?” She asked.\n\n“I am who I am,” the stag bellowed, “I will call you Lucy.” \n\n“I like the name Lucy. You are very beautiful Mr. Stag.” \n\nThe rain, which had stopped briefly, returned. \n\n“Walk with me, Lucy.” The Stag stomped the ground, &amp; an umbrella emerged. \n\n\nLucy grabbed it, &amp; winced slightly at the sudden pause of rain. \n\nShe got up, &amp; neared the Stag. She held his on to him to keep herself steady.\n\n\nThey walked for a minutes, or hours, or seconds. No one could really be sure. “I wish to be like you, Mr Stag. You are so lovely with your white fur.” \n\n“You don’t know what you ask.” \n\nHowever long they were walking, the trees were now as large as the pillars from the heaven Lucy came from, but no longer recalls.\n\nThe Stag laid down to rest, &amp; beckoned Lucy to come rest with him. \n\nAs he laid down to rest, Lucy took a piece of his horn, and used it to cut off his flesh, which she wrapped over herself. Lucy was now covered in rich, soft white fur. \nWhen the Stag awoke, he noticed his fur was gone, and he was naked. He knew what had happened.\nThis cursed Lucy to be a doe of mere flesh and bone, condemned to die. \nTime was set into motion. Death was the first clock. \nLucy hid from the stag till her death.\n\n\nThe Stag found Lucy three hundred &amp; sixty five days later while he was rounding the forest. He was crushed. \n\nHe decided to call her demise a year.\nHe was so moved, he decided to lay down by her one last time. He fell into a deep sleep.\nThe trees, saw the Stag’s mourning. They were crushed, because they felt the pure love the Stag had for his creation.\nThe trees mourned as well. They rid themselves of their leaves, turning them into a blood red, before they fell off. This was the first time they had done anything so risky. The Stag would later call this Fall. \n\n\nWhen the Stag woke up, the sky was sunny &amp; blue. The trees were full of leaves &amp; heavy with a bright red fruit. He walked up to one &amp; tasted it. The fruit was sweet. he called it an apple. \nThat’s when the Stag saw him. \n\nThe boy jumped. He had just opened his eyes. In front of him was the corpse of a deer, long dead and rotting. \nA few paces behind the rotting deer, stood a stag. \nThe Stag looked at the boy. His empty skull showing no expression. \n\n“A-are you Death? Did you kill that deer?” The boy asked.\n\n“No I am not death,” the stag answered. \n\n“Who are you?” \n\n“I am a friend. May I sit with you?” \n\n\nThe boy glanced warily at the Stag for several moments before nodding.\n“You May call me Ternate,” said the Stag,” for I am the sky, the forest’s trees, &amp; this stag.”\n\n\n“You’re the sky? I came from the sky, I think,” the boy pointed upward,” can I have an apple?” Ternate nodded. \n\n“Ternate, are you sure you aren’t death? You seem very scary.” \n\n\nThe Stag, realizing that he was currently nothing but bones, shook the trees down, and dressed himself in leaves. \nThey sat together, until the sun set. \nThe boy eyed Lucy. \n\n\n“Am I going to die like that deer, Ternate?”\nThe stag looked over at Lucy’s body, seeing himself in her fur. \n\n“I don’t know. Only time will tell.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\n“Can we go somewhere else? It’s getting dark.”\n\nThe stag nodded, lifting its heavy frame up from where it sat. \nThe Stag walked up to Lucy one last time and pressed his forehead to hers. The ground opened up and took her in. \nThe leaves the stag wore turned back to white fur.\nWithout hesitating, the boy’s eyes lit up “You’re beautiful, Mr. Stag.”","title":"[MF] The Stag"},"questions":[{"question":"Discuss the setting of the story.","answers":[{"answer":"The setting is a forest.

Where it always does I suppose, with the vows. Do you take this woman, to have and to hold in sickness and in health? Bullshit! Michael thought to himself. It ought to say are you taken with this woman. That’s exactly what he had been with Irene…. Taken! The better question he thought to himself as he sat there, alone in the waiting room was where did it all go wrong?\n\n\tSitting there alone in the twelve feet wide by twenty-three foot long white box. Michael sat in the same waiting room chair that decorated every waiting room across the country. Two plastic arm supports thinner than any person’s forearm he had ever encountered. Who the fucks arm is this suppose to support? A predetermined back angle as if everyone set with the same posture. Michael was angry, not with the room although it did irritate and enrage him for many reason but no, Michael was angry at life and how his had turned out in particular. \n\n\tSitting there in only chair in the white, picture less, waiting room Michael rotated his wedding band between his fingers like a magician does before making the coin disappear, starting at his pinky finger ending at his index finger before starting the process over again. One might look upon Michael as if he was lost in thought had they walked in on him, but he was not lost in thought for Michael knew exactly where his thoughts were at. They were on the wedding band, for that he surmised is where everything went wrong. \n\n\tA white gold band size ten in his case, with ten little diamond chunks set inside the band itself when it was purchased. It of course was bought as a match to Irene’s. He remembered the event like it was yesterday and not ten years ago. They had been in the mall and both spotted the Kay’s sign and went in. Irene and Michael were doing it backwards, they had married just hours earlier at the Bell County, Courthouse.\n\n\tHer face lit up when she saw the one carat diamond, it was one of the many smiles he would see on her face during the first two years of their marriage, but like everything else in life even the smiles fade he thought. The woman behind the counter Camille, Michael never forgot the name of a person that made Irene smile. It was a blessing back then and a curse as of the last few years. Camille placed the ring on Irene’s finger with all the tenderness and caring that Michael did not get to do back at the courthouse.\n\n\tHe had to admit that when he first looked at the rings on their hands after they purchased them. “No need for bags he had told Camille! We will wear them out give everyone a chance to see an ordinary ring on an extraordinary woman!” Irene use to eat up his compliments back then no matter how cheesy he thought they sounded, she would always smile or squeeze his arm tighter. Yes, even he believed in the happiness they represented when they walked out of the store ten years ago to the day. \n\n\tLooking at the weathered ring now brought him back to a sobering reality. The scratches some deep, some minor, the diamond that fell out once and was replaced. It fell out again along the years and like most stuff in life you get tired of trying to fix it and you let it be. In some ways the wedding band had outlasted him. It was still on his fingers albeit worn and beaten but still there. Michael wished he could say the same for his Irene.\n\n\tHe thought about how if he had never bought her the ring or stood in front of that justice of the peace then there would have never been broken promises. There never would have been late nights. There never would have been whiskey on his breath. Most of all Michael thought there never would have been him.\n\t\n\tHindsight’s twenty/twenty his father had told him. Bill, his name was Bill. He had never had such rage in his heart for any name as he did for that name. The name that stripped everything from him, his life, his passion…his soul mate. He had never met the face behind the name; Irene had not afforded him that opportunity. Michael chose not to dwell on the memories of Bill; after all he had so few only the details that Irene had provided him before waling out of his life.\n\n\tShe told him only enough so that he could understand why. Irene had not wanted to hurt Michael so she left out how they met after all that wasn’t important. What was important is that they met. Michael sat there in the only chair in that white picture less box of a waiting room when the buzzer sounded signaling that one patient was coming out and the next one would be buzzed in. A woman who looked to be about twenty three exited the room casually glanced at Michael before leaving.\n\n\tMichael stood slowly wondering if the blonde had smelled the whiskey on his breath as she passed by.

A total donation of 30 million kroner from three foundations is making it possible to digitise, study and disseminate more than 400 silent films from the golden age of Danish cinema.\n\n11. December 2018\n\nOne of the most important chapters in Danish film history will now become available thanks to a donation of DKK 30 million from the A.P. Møller Foundation, the Aage and Johanne Louis-Hansen Foundation and the Augustinus Foundation.\n\nFrom around 1910, the Danish film industry was a world leader, both commercially and artistically, with Nordisk Films Kompagni (now Nordisk Film) at the forefront. Stars like Asta Nielsen, Valdemar Psilander and Fy & Bi were famous way beyond their home country, and Denmark’s greatest film director, Carl Th. Dreyer, was prolific during this period as well. When sound films gained ground in the early 1930s, production companies scrapped their inventories of silent films. Only an estimated 20% of the Danish silent film production exists today.\n\nThe archives contain at least 50 titles that have not been shown since they were first released more than a century ago. Among them, we might find forgotten masterpieces that could change our understanding of Danish silent film history.\n\nIn the coming years, the Danish Film Institute will digitise, study and disseminate Denmark’s entire silent film heritage, consisting of some 415 titles with a combined running time of around 350 hours. The films range wide and far, from prestige productions with international appeal to run-of-the-mill farces and test films, illustrating the technical evolution from silent to sound, colour to black and white, and so on.\n\n []\nThe biggest stars die young. The world famous silent film actor Valdemar Psilander died only 32 years old.\n\n\nStudying and disseminating the film heritage \n\nThe project is the biggest film-dissemination effort ever in Denmark and follows four years of work mapping the collections. The many films and supplementary materials will now be made freely available to curious viewers and institutions of learning around the world, where Danish silents are already part of the curriculum for students of film history.\n\nThe masterpieces in the collections are being restored and scanned for theatrical screening, and an online universe is being created featuring all the films, accompanied by dissemination and research articles. Along the way, the Film Institute will share knowledge about the restoration and digitisation efforts.\n\n []\nAsta Nielsen and Urban Gad were both a married couple and colleagues who worked in Germany.\n\nA three-year Danish-German research project affiliated with the digitisation effort will map the cross-border traffic of ideas and people between two leading nations of the silent film era, Denmark and Germany. The project is carried out in partnership with the University of Copenhagen and the University of Cologne. The research team comprises five senior researchers, a Ph.D. fellow and a research assistant.\n\nJakob Buhl Vestergaard, Deputy Managing Director of the Danish Film Institute, says\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nLARS-MARTIN SØRENSEN\nForskningsleder\nTlf. +45 3374 3574\nlarss@dfi.dk\n\nJAKOB BUHL VESTERGAARD\nVicedirektør\nTlf. +45 2020 1838\njakobv@dfi.dk\n\n\"It is with great gratitude to the contributing foundations, and tremendous anticipation, that we are launching this comprehensive project.

After becoming a solo dancer with the Royal Danish Ballet in 1950, she was a guest dancer with the Original Ballet Russe in 1951. She was then engaged by the Paris Opera Ballet until 1954. Lander also appeared with the London Festival Ballet in the late 1950s and with the American Ballet Theatre in the 1960s. After a few years back in Denmark in the early 1970s, in 1976 she joined the Ballet West in Salt Lake City. After a short illness, she died there of cancer in May 1985.[1][2][3]\n\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Gentofte on 19 June 1931, Toni Pihl Petersen was the daughter of Knud Åge Carl Pihl Petersen (1905–1972) and Agnes Margrethe Andersen (1907–1950).[4] When she was six, she began training under Leif Ørnberg (1904–1977), who immediately recognized her talents. In 1939, as an eight-year-old, she was admitted to the Royal Danish Ballet School where she advanced quickly. Thanks to her height, she was able to join the ballet corps while still studying. The ballet sequences of Bournonville were the basis for the ballet school but as she became an aspirant, Harald Lander took a personal interest in her training, introducing her to Russian ballet.[5]\n\n\nCareer\n\nWhen she was 15, she make her début as Sophie in Vilhelm Christian Holm's _Livjægerne paa Amager_ (The Lifeguards on Amager). A year later, she gained wide acclaim, dancing Margot Lander's difficult part in _Étude_. In 1951 Lander rewrote the part for her. Ten years later, under the name _Études_, it became her most notable part for the rest of her career.[6]\n\nIn 1950, she became a solo dancer. On 15 April of that year, she married Harald Lander (1905–1971) but her relationship with him was to bring her major problems. In 1951, he was dismissed from the Royal Danish Ballet for misusing his position. She followed him to Paris where he became artistic director of the Paris Opera Ballet but in order to avoid accusations of favoratism, she continued to train in Russian ballet under Ljubov Egorova, and Olga Preobrajenska. For a few months, she danced with the Ballets Russes but moved to London in 1954 where she appeared as a replacement at the London Festival Ballet, taking on the role of Odette in Swan Lake at short notice. She performed so well that she was engaged by the company for the next five years.[7]\n\nShe travelled widely with the Festival Ballet, performing both Russian ballet and Bournonville roles. In 1957, she appeared at the Tivoli Concert Hall in Copenhagen where she danced in _Études_ and _Swan Lake_. She was honoured with the Order of the Dannebrog. She returned to the Falconer Centre in Copenhagen in 1959, where both she and her husband were widely acclaimed, preparing the way for _Etudes_ at the Royal Danish Theatre.[8]\n\nIn 1960, she moved to New York for an engagement with American Ballet Theatre. She appeared in a more extensive repertoire, including _Miss Julie_ and _The Moon Reindeer_ by the Swedish choreographer Birgit Culberg, as well as Antony Tudor's _Jardin aux Lilas_. When Flemming Flindt became artistic director of the Royal Danish Ballet in 1966, he invited Toni Lander to appear as a guest dancer in 1967. She demonstrated her wide experience by dancing the pas de deux from _Don Quixote_, Eliza in Bournonville's _Konservatoriet_ and the title role from _Miss Julie_, all in one evening.[9]\n\nIn 1964, After she and Harald Lander had divorced in 1964, in January 1966 she married the American dancer Bruce Marks with whom she had three children: Eric Anthony (1968), Adam Christopher (1970), Kenneth Rikard (1974). Her last assignment with the American Ballet was in the première of José Limón's _The Moor's Pavane_.[10] In 1971, she returned to Denmark after an international career lasting 20 years, quite exceptional for a Danish ballerina. In parallel with appearances in _The Moor's Pavane_ (1971–1976), she taught at the ballet school while Marks performed as a solo dancer. When Marks was invited to become artistic director of Ballet West in Salt Lake City, Lander once again followed her husband, becoming head of training there. While with the Ballet West, she presented _Études_ at the Paris Opera, Budapest Opera and the National Ballet of Amsterdam.[11] She collaborated with Flemming Ryberg on presenting a new version of Bournonville's _Abdallah_ which premièred in February 1985. In 1983, she had divorced Marks and was ready to accept an invitation to become the first female artistic director for the Royal Danish Ballet. She was prevented from doing so from a rapidly developing cancer which led to her death in Salt Lake City on 19 May 1985, aged only 53.[12][13]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n","title":"Toni Lander"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about Toni Lander's private life?","answers":[{"answer":"She was born in 1931.

Her father, Stiles Richard Dodson, was the son of Richard Dodson and Hannah Watson, being a descendant of Thomas and Mary Dodson, of whom the doctor's mother was also a descendant. Her mother, Mrs. Caroline Matilda (née Harrison) Dodson, was the daughter of Stephen Harrison, and Mary Dodson. Miss Dodson's father and mother were natives of Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania and married in 1836. Her mother was Mrs. C. Matilda Dodson About six weeks after marriage, they left Pennsylvania for the West and settled in Van Buren County, Iowa. Stiles R. Dodson died in 1847, leaving his widow with four daughters, the youngest less than two years of age. Her sisters were named Melvina (d. 1862), Mary, and Susan. That winter, the mother taught school in her own house. In the spring of 1848, she returned with her family to her father's house in Pennsylvania. Caroline was baptized in November, 1857, and thereafter, she was a member of the Baptist church.\n\nStudy at home under private teachers and at the district school supplemented the early lessons from the mother. At about twelve, she was sent to an academy and normal institute. She began to teach in the winter of 1861. Returning at intervals to school, she followed the profession of teaching until the fall of 1871 when she matriculated at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, and entered upon the three-year course just inaugurated. Dr. Ann Preston was then Dean. The summer of 1872, she spent in the Nurses' Training School of the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia. The course required was completed and Dodson received a certificate of the Training School for Nurses. The summer of 1873, she spent in the same hospital as student in the wards and out practice. She received her diploma in March, 1874, and went to Ypsilanti, Michigan, for further study with Dr. Ruth A. Gerry, one of the first women to practice medicine.\n\n\nCareer\n\nAfter a year spent in hospital and private practice with Gerry, Dodson went to Rochester, New York, and there, in connection with a practice, opened a drug store. In 1877, her mother having gone West again, Dodson started for Iowa, going by the Hudson and Great Lakes. She lost a car load of valuables in the riot at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter her trip West, she returned to Philadelphia and worked at whatever appeared to be profitable. For a time, she depended upon per week to meet the living expenses of three in her family, but offers came, and among them, unsolicited, one from the Philadelphia Society for Organizing Charity to act as superintendent of one of its districts. Dodson accepted the position, and for eight years, filled it in connection with her private practice of medicine.\n\nNational Woman's Health Association of America\n\nAs a teacher, she wrote and spoke boldly for better methods of education, and advocated broadening the opportunities for study. She saw that a general movement might help to educate the masses and to spread a knowledge of self-care. To this end, after much deliberation, a call was issued for a public meeting to be held in Association Hall, Philadelphia, July 23, 1890, and an organization was effected under the name of the National Woman's Health Association of America. The association was chartered November 1, 1890. and Dodson was elected first president. The plan of the association was broad and provided for extensive work. Its objective was to bring the medical profession into closer relation with the general public by the discussion of health topics.\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nDodson read widely on subjects concerning the movements of women, speaking and writing in their interest. In 1888, at the 19th annual convention of the Pennsylvania Woman's Suffrage Association, Dodson's missionary work was noted in laudatory terms.[1]\n\nDodson founded the Baptist Sisterhood in Philadelphia.[2] She died at her home in Philadelphia, January 9, 1898, of sarcoma.[3]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n","title":"Caroline Matilda Dodson"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize Caroline's life during the 1910s.","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"No answer.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"No answer","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null},{"question":"Summarize everything relating to Caroline's mother.

You can’t be serious. This has to be a joke,” The Captain of the party said, a dark warrior elf, sheathing his blade and walking over to his horse.\n\n“Now, if you two are done horsing around, we have a mission to get back to.”\n\n“We’re serious, Matthias,” Jazhira replied, her mouth mashed into a tight white line. “We’re joining another party.”\n\n“Oh yeah?” Matthias replied. “Which one?”\n\nFor his part, he was unbothered; this was probably a bluff to get him and the rest of the party feeling bad about how they were treated.\n\n“The Carrion Crows.”\n\nThere was a brief, pregnant silence, thick with tension.\n\n“You mean the dark party that everyone is afraid of, across the Empire? You must be joking.” Matthias scoffed, and there were a few titters of disbelief.\n\nWhy would The Carrion Crows, of all people, take their weakest party members?\n\n“We set out for their headquarters in the morning,” Gavin rumbled, shrugging. “This will be our last night with you lot, and good riddance.”\n\n\\*\\*\n\nWhen the dawn came, Jazhira and Gavin were gone; they’d left nothing behind. It was as if they’d never been.\n\nBut as the day went on, Matthias and the others kept receiving correspondence: The Carrion Crows had two new members, and they were powerful. The Healer had become a bringer of darkness and death, with people becoming fatally ill in droves. Gavin, their barbarian orc warrior, had his own quickly climbing body count, destroying towns and ports.\n\nIt appeared that Matthias and his friends were going to have to help clean up this mess they’d made.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nWhen Matthias and the others finally made it to the site of the carnage, it was nothing less than an utter massacre.\n\nJazhira stood at the center of the town, in the square, orchestrating the chaos like a conductor leads a symphony. \n\nShe was glorious and terrifying, her long chestnut hair waving in the magical wind she’d created like a banner, her fingers glowing a bright, sickly green. A dark, miasmic fog had settled over the town like a thick wool blanket, and all around her, people were dropping like flies. Her wild, manic laughter reached the group, music from a nightmare, and Matthias gripped his horse’s mane in his hands.\n\nUnderestimating them had been an awful, irrevocable mistake they could not take back.\n\nGavin, however, was deep in the thick of it.

After he walked through the yard to the driveway, he made sure to latch the gate securely, because that’s what Sarah liked. He smiled as he did so, and thought of how earlier, he had closed the shower curtain all the way (another Sarah preference), and gently lowered the toilet seat. Twenty four hours earlier, they had been feuding; and he deliberately did none of these things; just to piss her off!  As he climbed into his car for his daily sucky commute up Route 128 to Route 93; into Boston, he was filled with regret and chuckled at the pettiness of his previous day’s actions. After all; how hard was it to accommodate several very minor quirks of his wife of fifteen years?\n\n\nThat morning, he had been awakened by Sarah gently kissing around his ear, nuzzling against his back, softly stroking his shoulders. This was in stark contrast to the previous three nights; when she had seemed to build an invisible wall between them. Sarah was an expert at staying on her “side”. No inadvertent touching during the night; not even a slight brush of the leg or a stray rollover. Her version of a cold shoulder was more like a frozen cadaver.\n\n\nHer affections this morning, were surely a signal that an olive branch had been extended; and a peace treaty had been declared. The latest “war of the Floyds”; a seventy two hour skirmish; had ended.\n\n\nThe latest battle had been initiated on Saturday night; a dinner outing with their best friends. After several before and after cocktails;  Sarah, in response to what Gary felt was a very innocuous comment about Sarah’s weight gain over the past ten years, had flipped Gary “the bird”.  While Gary waited in traffic to access the on ramp to 128, he conjured up the incident in his brain. He mused about the fury that could be unleashed by a simple injudicious observation; but he also felt ashamed of his immature pouting and anger in response to such a mundane gesture as a raised middle finger. \n\n\nSarah and Gary were complete opposites. Sarah loved to go to the mall and shop for hours. Gary detested the thought of entering even one store. Sarah hated watching sports, Gary loved all sports. Sarah was fastidious, she cleaned and scrubbed meticulously. Gary was a slob; who would often ask Sarah to “give it a break, the house is clean enough”; (especially when she vacuumed the living room while he was watching a football game).\n\n\nGary inched onto Route 93 South, and switched from sports talk to a Sirius 70s radio station. The subscription to Sirius had been a birthday gift from Sarah. Gary had told her that it was an unnecessary expense; there were plenty of free radio stations, but Sarah insisted. Gary had come to love the non-stop oldies from the 60s and 70s. Steppenwolf blasted from the speakers, and he howled in unison when they belted out the refrain; “Born to be Willlllllllllllllllld”, and for a moment. envisioned himself a single dude; no wife, no twelve year old son (Steven), no boring nine-to-five job, no responsibilities, no hassles!\n\n\nHe clicked the stereo radio control on the steering wheel and jumped back to the 60s station, ironically, to The Monkees’ sweet ballad, “I Want to be Free”.  This only reinforced his thirst for liberation and his distaste for married life. He was sick of the petty arguments and all the compromises that he made for family. Hell, his weekly night out with the guys had been reduced lately to monthly night out! \n\n\nAll day long, while Gary answered EMails, juggled spreadsheets, and performed his daily office tasks, a yearning stirred within him to be rid of all the shackles that he had placed upon himself. He daydreamed about quitting his well paying but stressful job and become a full-time bartender; hang out all day drinking beer and watching sporting events.  As this lovely picture played out in his mind, the phone on his desk beeped; and the caller ID readout revealed that Sarah was on the line. \n\n\nGary picked up the receiver, and told Sarah, “We need to talk”. \n\n\n“Yes”, Sarah replied softly. \n\n\nBefore he could say anything else, Sarah apologized for the three day freezeout. She also informed Gary that she had arranged a sleepover that night at the neighbor’s for Steven; and that she would be making Gary’s favorite dinner: fresh sliced fries and baked filet mignon with butter, mushrooms, and onion ring.  Dessert was to be decided upon later, by Gary! \n\n\nFor the balance of the day; Gary’s fantasies swerved in a different direction. His aspiration to live the single life dissipated. and the longing that he previously experienced was replaced by a sense of appreciation for Sarah’s humility, caring and tenderness. His thoughts about separation reverted to anticipation of their approaching union. He regretted the joking remark he made that had kicked off their most recent tiff. He knew his wife was super-sensitive about her body image, and would not be pleased with his attempt at humor.\n\n\nThe drive home featured unusually clear sailing on the highways. As Gary rounded the corner and turned onto his street, one of his favorite Bob Seger songs came on the radio: “Beautiful Loser”. He chortled at the lyrics:\n\n\n“He wants his home and security ………… He wants to live like a sailor at sea”.\n\n\nAs he mulled the sentiment, a rueful smile came upon his face. He reached for the kitchen doorknob, but Sarah swung it open before he had a chance to push. She jumped into his arms.\n\n\n“How was your day, baby?”\n\n\n“I love you, Sarah.”\n","title":"[HM] - Gary &amp; Sarah"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize how Gary feels about his life.","answers":[{"answer":"Gary feels like he is stuck in a rut.

The descent into Vanity Heights was a perfect contradiction. Darcy’s den was full of promises. The promises of allure, freedom, revelry. The promises of power and powder, regret, addiction. But the promise that Vanity Heights fulfilled best was not Darcy’s own. It was the promise flashed upon the television, upon the computer screen, canonised on the glossed pages of magazines. The expectations of how teenager life should be; the expectations, up until this night, crushed by education and responsibility. This was the promise that led Darcy’s guests down the stairs. Down the stairs into Vanity Heights. \n\nThe house had transformed into a delinquent ballroom. The girls dropped as low as their heels would allow; their men watched through the haze. Darcy was a dragon. A pink dragon, breathing about the toxic smoke of his habit. He was perched upon his barstool throne, positioned strategically in the centre of the room, when she arrived. \n“Celeste!” he exclaimed, prancing over to her, a stick of addiction in one hand and a glass of hobby in the other. She gave a long hug, a short conversation and an expected question. With a customary smile, Darcy gave to her an expected bottle of answer. \n\nThe party raved on, yet the revelry was muted by the brick wall that barricaded Celeste from the action. The rhythmic dripping of the basin tap was the only music Celeste had, yet she chose to reapply her face instead of dancing. She wanted to dance, though, and she knew Darcy would be waiting for her, so she rushed through her routine. She clasped onto her 50mL glass friend, already thrice-used, even though she had been in the bathroom only five minutes. \n        The drink was downed within seconds of being poured; the liquid sunk to her stomach. She could feel the warm tendrils, cooing words of friendship, branching through her chest, her stomach and finally, finally, back up to drown her mind; pulling her further from the world and closer to her weekend friends. \n        Six doses later, to finish the bottle, and she was ready to join them. \n\nNo one ever really knew why she was there. Good school, great grades, aspirations of business and law. Nevertheless, she was soon jiving and twisting and dropping on the floor, with Darcy and other men: around them and in their laps; their hands hoping to get in hers.  Her beholder lay seemingly dormant in her stomach; though its dark tendrils were tightening, strengthening their grip on Celeste, controlling her like a puppet with tangled strings. She thought the overseer a friend, a protector, but her body knew better.\n\nCeleste mapped her escape as soon as she felt it. Up the stairs, out of Vanity Heights, past the kitchen, into the garden bed just by the backdoor. She pushed through the crowd. Darcy saw her leave; he knew why, but he didn’t follow.  He never did. By the time she reached the stairs, the beast had revealed itself. A kraken, furious as red, limbs thrashing about inside of her, fighting desperately for an escape. Tentacles of fear, doubt, regret, disappointment. \n‘No,’ she thought once more, ‘I shouldn’t be disappointed.’ She knew she wasn't wasting her life; she was just having a little to drink. She wasn’t reckless and irresponsible; she was just a normal teenager. She was just having fun, she has earned it, she would stop after tonight, leave her alone. Her stomach was having none of that, though. She made a mistake by trying to fly the stairs two at a time. Her feet tangled and she fell, the first wave of expel surging from her, onto the steps above.\n\nWhilst the beast had once been considered friend, it had no more. It escaped her again, covering her hair, clothes, face. She tried to pull herself further up the stairs, but the sickly purple tentacles constricted about her and dragged her down; down, down, down, back into Vanity Heights.  \n‘Vile guardian’, she cried, ‘noxious saviour, foul beast, nefarious raper; first friend, now foe. Always, foe’. \nThe stench accompanying her disgrace engulfed her wholly, yet the contents of her stomach continued to emerge, again and again, onto the step where her head now resigned to lay. \n‘Never again,’ she sobbed, she promised to herself, her parents, her schoolwork. \n‘Never again,’ she promised, but Celeste’s promises were made to be broken and it was already too late. She lay shattered upon the stair case, empress turned peasant; her knight in glass armour had left her and once more she had nothing. The world around her spun, and sank, and faded to black. \n\n","title":"Vanity Heights"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story say about what happened to Celeste after she passed out?","answers":[{"answer":"The story ends with Celeste lying on the stairs, having passed out.

He received his first commissions during study trips to Rome and the Veneto.\n\nIn 1797, during a stay in Bologna, he moved in political circles close to the ideas of the French Revolution. Salucci thereby aroused the mistrust of the government of the Habsburg Grand Duchy of Tuscany and was sentenced to death in absentia in 1798. Thereupon he joined the French Italian Army.\n\nIn 1801 he was employed as topographer for the Cisalpine Republic, a daughter republic under Napoleon in northern Italy, and in 1802 he worked on the fortifications of Alessandria, Mantua, and Verona.\n\nAfterwards he took part in the French invasion of Russia. He survived and managed to escape to Danzig. After the Battle of Waterloo he fell into English captivity, from which he was released in 1816.\n\nAfter his release, he initially worked for the Geneva banker Jean Gabriel Eynard, from whom he received a recommendation for King Wilhelm I of Württemberg. The latter appointed him court architect in 1818.\n\nIn Württemberg, the Royal Pavilion in Weil near Esslingen was initially built in collaboration with the Queen Catherine of Württemberg, who was a passionate lover of architecture. In 1819, after her death, he built her Württemberg Mausoleum. From 1823 to 1829 the Schloss Rosenstein was built according to the plans of Salucci. Other buildings designed by him are the Wilhelmspalais and the Alte Reithalle (royal riding hall), both in Stuttgart.\n\nSince the planned costs for the Royal Pavilion in Weil were exceeded, he soon had to have everything approved by the Building and Garden Directorate. In 1828, after a dispute with a superior, he applied for his dismissal. Four days later, however, he asked to be reinstated. In 1839 dry rot was discovered in Rosenstein Castle, for which Salucci was made responsible; this led to his final dismissal.\n\nIn 1840 Salucci returned to Florence almost penniless. He died there in 1845 and was buried in the cloister of the St Mark’s, Florence.\n\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Esslingen am Neckar Weil Koeniglicher Pavillon.jpg|Royal pavilion in Esslingen-Weil File:S-wilhelmspalais.jpg|Wilhelmspalais at Charlottenplatz in Stuttgart File:Schloss Rosenstein südwestliche Hauptfassade.jpg|Castle Rosenstein in Stuttgart File:Grabkapelle Württemberg Eingang (2009).jpg|Württemberg Mausoleum in Stuttgart\n\n\nWorks in Public Collections\n\n-   Salucci's estate, consisting of 142 drafts of buildings, is located in the Stuttgart University Library (Inv.

He had a look of anticipation, as if he was waiting for some pain relieving gossip. \n\n“I was home,” I responded innocently before he rolled his eyes at me. “Now, don’t bother me, I’m trying to focus.” Although normally I would use anything to distract me from school, I wasn’t about to involve Max in last night’s mess.\n\n“Are you expecting me to believe you weren’t at Nina’s party?” He raised his eyebrows at me. I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me. Perhaps I couldn’t fix her parent’s divorce, but I could at least attend her house party. Especially after her break up with Todd, the leather jacket douche that called her “babe” so much I would wonder if he knew her real name.\n\n“I promise you’ll have a great time,” Nina had told me. And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle. Something nostalgic about repetitive rap songs preaching about the wonders of big asses. \n\nEverything seemed normal at first. The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room. I could feel the air thickening. \n\nMinutes before terror, I was standing unnoticed next to a group of girls I recognized. \n\n“Someone told me her dad was abusive,” I heard one say with wide eyes. \n\n“Yeah, apparently the neighbors called the cops on them,” another responded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t point fingers just yet. Nina’s mom’s a bitch. Maybe she deserved it,” a brunette shrugged and took a sip of her drink right before our eyes met. Her face flared red as she realized her words had been overhead. I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately.

He was the second Lutheran bishop and was directly involved in the Icelandic Reformation.\n\n\nEarly life\n\nMarteinn was born in Staðarstaður on the Snæfellsnes peninsula to the poet Einar Ölduhryggjarskáld and Ingiríður Jónsdóttir. Marteinn's family had a tradition of serving as priests. His father, Einar, was a priest in Staðarstaður from about 1500 until his death in 1538, and Ingiríður's brother, , had served as bishop of Skálholt from 1491 to 1518. Marteinn's siblings included the sheriffs and Brandur Einarsson, known as Gleraugna-Pétur and Moldar-Brandur respectively, as well as a sister, Guðrún, the wife of the magistrate Daði Guðmundsson.\n\nMarteinn spent nine years studying in England, where another of his sisters lived after marrying an Englishman, before returning to Iceland to work as a merchant in Grindavík.\n\n\nBishop\n\nIn 1533, Marteinn became a priest, serving in Staðarstaður after his father's death. He was an early supporter of the Reformation, and in 1548, Marteinn was elected bishop of Skálholt after the death of Gissur Einarsson, the first Lutheran bishop in Iceland. [1] Despite an effort by the Catholic bishop Jón Arason, the primary opponent of the spread of Protestantism in Iceland, to have named bishop instead, Marteinn was consecrated in Denmark as bishop of Skálholt on 7 April 1549.[2]\n\nUpon his return to Iceland that summer, Marteinn was arrested by Jón's sons, Ara and Björn Jónsson, who detained him at Ara's farm at Möðrufell. Marteinn remained detained until after the Battle of Sauðafell in 1550, where Daði Guðmundsson defeated Jón Arason, ending organized Catholic resistance to the Reformation, at which time he formally took control of the bishopric of Skálholt.[3]\n\nIn 1555, Marteinn published the first Icelandic hymnal, _Lítið Psálmakver_.[4] Marteinn served as bishop until 1557, when he resigned in protest of claims by the king decision to appropriate church tithes.[5] He returned to Staðarstaður where he served as a priest until his retirement in 1569.\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nMarteinn was married to Ingibjörg, whose father's name is unknown. They had four sons and two daughters. Marteinn lived out his retirement in where he published a collection of psalms and was considered a good painter, although none of his paintings are known to survive.[6] He died in 1756.\n\n\nFiction\n\nMarteinn appears in Ólafur Gunnarsson's 2003 historical novel _Öxin og jörðin_ (translated into English as _The Ax and the Earth_), which is set amid Jón Arason's struggle against the Icelandic Reformation.\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n","title":"Marteinn Einarsson"},"questions":[{"question":"When did Marteinn Einarsson live?","answers":[{"answer":"He lived from 1500-1569.","critiques":[{"critique":"Marteinn was born in 1510, not 1500.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"He lived from 1500-1569.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"Marteinn Einarsson lived from 1501-1569.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"Marteinn Einarsson was born in 1510.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"He lived from 1500-1569, but he died in 1576.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"incomplete answer.

The merciless July heat tapered off as a welcome breeze lightly caressed my cheek. If a person stood in the shade for too long, they might have mistaken it for a perfect spring day. The birds were singing. It felt fantastic to be alive but it was a saccharine moment. An ugly storm was on the horizon.\n\nPrior to that, I’d been sipping cool lemonade on the front porch in my Adirondack chair. I heard a distant thunderclap which threatened to quash the temperate afternoon fantasy. The approaching storm drifted closer and I wondered if it was cause for alarm. Living in ‘tornado alley’, it’s always in the back of my mind. The clouds turned dark purple and then an ugly shade of gray. Only in hindsight did I learn what terror it carried within.\n\nNot wanting to get soaked, I went inside to avoid the upcoming cloud burst. No sooner than I had closed the door, heavy droplets started pinging the rooftop. The melodic tempo was soothing at first but as the intensity increased, its gentle rhythm was lost. Not only did the rain intensify, but the atmospheric theatrics took my breath away. Angry bolts of lightning menaced the sky. I was glad to be inside.\n\nThen the hail came. First it was mixed with rain. It would’ve been easy to mistake it for just larger raindrops. Soon however, the ice pellets were the size of golf balls. They savagely pounded the roof. Then I heard my car windshield shatter from the merciless barrage. Even my house windows were not immune. They were under attack as the wind flung the frozen projectiles sideways at them.\n\nA look out of my picture window brought a far worse sight. In the distance was the unmistakable shape of a deadly funnel. It slowly descended to the ground and started destroying everything in its wake. I judged it to be less than two miles away and closing fast. At that distance, I couldn’t outrun it and risked fleeing directly into it’s path, if it changed direction. I had to take cover at home and hope for the best. \n\nThe storm grew so ferocious I feared my house would collapse before the tornado even arrived. The walls shook and shuddered. The rising wail of a ‘train whistle’ filled the air. I opened up the windows since they would blow out if the inside wasn’t depressurized. I prepared for the inevitable. Death was on a collision course and nothing could stop it from happening. It slithered toward me as if to wipe away my entire existence. I strongly suspected it might do just that. A thousand bittersweet memories flooded my mind. The roar of the whirling wind drowned out my screams until the maelstrom arrived at my doorstep.\n\nIn the eye of the tornado I had a moment of clarity amid the chaos. I watched as debris flew by in a blur. I fully expected to see my roof fly off and the walls shred away. Instead, a pale column of smoke began to seep in through the open window. My fear was already at the limits of human endurance. I was too distracted about the immanent devastation to worry about a strange fog swirling around my home. That is, until it began to separate into distinctively humanoid shapes! \n\nBefore my disbelieving eyes, three faceless forms hovered and drifted around the room. The unexplained ‘wraiths’ almost seemed to be assessing the situation. Were they supernatural agents of death? Was the tornado a vehicle for them; or was the storm itself their physical manifestation? Whether they were angels or demons from Hell, I didn’t know. Obviously I tried to avoid drawing any attention to myself. I couldn’t imagine things getting worse than having to deal with a mindless twister but having three spirits officiate it upped the ante. \n\nRegardless of my stealth, they knew I was there; cowering in the corner for a completely new reason. There was a brief hesitation among them as they descended upon me. I could hear shingles being torn from the roof but my sole focus was those three uninvited guests, hovering less than ten feet away. It was positively terrifying. I’ve never been a religious man but it was impossible to deny the supernatural event unfolding in my living room. The irony is that I didn’t expect to survive long enough to share my experience. \n\nMy three visitors were stationary for the moment. I felt their somber attention upon me but with no eyes, there was nowhere to focus my view. Their faceless gaze and ashen features chilled me to the bone. I sensed that I was being judged. To what degree or for what reasons, I had no idea. I did my best to project an air of innocence, good will and benevolence. How I came to be faced with not one, but two deadly trials in a single day, I couldn’t imagine. \n\nIn perhaps the most expressive form of non-verbal communication I had ever seen, the ethereal ‘judge’ to my left slowly turned a downy shade of virgin white. The full meaning of this gesture escaped me until the middle ‘judge’ also changed its translucent hue. To my great dismay, to that of a blackened lump of coal. Of the three overseers present, it appeared I had one vote for, and one vote against me in this macabre tornado court. \n\nIt seemed like an eternity until the final judgment was rendered. Slowly, the third otherworldly spirit took on the same light coloration as the first. The symbolic message I took from the proceeding was that I had been exonerated by a narrow majority vote. The three ‘judges’ drifted back into one unified pillar of smoke and left just as ‘it’ had come. \n\nOutside, the tornado dissipated back to nothingness. The sky above cleared back to normal in a matter of minutes. With the exception of an obvious trail of destruction leading straight to my home, I could hardly believe it even happened. It was like a bad dream. I’m eternally thankful that the three storm judges were favorable to me.

Arguable because maybe you don't need the whole house to know that you're typing. Best because there is a little tiny gavel in each one that--no matter how gingerly you caress the key--hammers down with the force of 2.4*10^-19 atomic bombs. \"I'm not sure whether the key actually got pressed,\" said nobody ever while typing on Cherry MX Blues.\n\nDespite being absolutely, positively, the sound that a Cherry MX Blue would make--a sound whose whole point is to have no duration, to mark a single moment and only that moment--the scientists assure us that it is still happening. Not like the \"click click click click,\" which is what is coming from the keys at my fingertips as I type this, but like \"clicccccccc.....\" on for ever. Except that there never really was a \"cli...\" and maybe there will never really be a \"..k.\"\n\nThe whole click is there in the signal, but the front and back of it, they say, are \"non-local\". Usually, when they say this, they are pointing at a pair of graphs, one of whose axes appears to be approaching a vertical asymtote according to the other. They make about as much sense of it as they ever do.\n\nApparently, if you're on a finite timeline, and you have a deadline tomorrow, you can just hang a left. Your new time axis runs parallel to the deadline, so they never intersect, and you never have to go to work again. The math all checks out, we're told--it's just that nobody has figured out how to actually do this. Not even the guy that pressed the big omnipresent MX Blue in the sky--he's non-local too. Whatever happened when he pressed that key, it may have set our clocks on a path where they would never see his deadline, but there's no reason to believe that it will save him.\n\nWhat is he writing?\n\nSome say that he had been up all night writing the laws of physics into a computer program, and that the click that we're hearing is the enter key that God pressed to start the universe running. This is, unsuprisingly, the position of the scientists who discovered the signal. Newton would have been one of these, had he live at the right time--Plato too. Little has changed for them, they're still bickering with the mathematicians about which language the universe is written in, and whether we'd notice if the program halted.\n\nOthers think it's a work of fiction. Well, fiction for him at least. The more optimistic of these think it's his first keystroke--a shift key to make the 'O' in \"Once upon a time...\" Whether it's a story about them, and whether they turn out to be a hero or a villain, comes down to how hero-worthy or villain-worthy their life turns out to be.\n\nHundreds of variations of the \"which key?\" story have emerged. Each, like these, comes equipped with its own particular philosophical--and ultimately political--overtones. Fractures appeared among even the most cohesive societies: The debate over whether the pope had the right to chose the church's favored key has bumbled on awkwardly for years now. It has become apparent that the two-party system is unstabe in a universe that thinks it was created on a 105-key keyboard. The last thing we all needed was yet another thing for schoolchildren to form cliques over.\n\nThree years ago, the largest sensor array on the planet was completed and powered on--we needed to know. It was theorized that despite the non-locality of the click as we hear it, there would be other objects in the author's world that it was local to. If there was any delay at all when our world forked off orthognally to the author's timeline, the sound should have reflected off of the neighboring keys. With a good enough sampling of the signal, we might be able to build a map.\n\nAlmost immediately they ruled out the possibility of the click having come from a spacebar--but nobody was suprised by this, spacebars sound much different than other keys due to their shape. Since then, the facility has remained silent--aware of the societal impact of an announcement, they have promised to keep quiet until they were absolutely sure.\n\nThat is, until today. The world is scrambling to make sense of the result. Apparently, it's a backspace. The talking heads are still working at adjusting their worldviews so that they can have been right all along. It will probably only take a few hours. But until that happens, the world is quiet except for a small handful.\n\n105 keys, 9 billion people--somebody was bound to be right. According to them, everything to the left of the cursor is unchangeable to us. There it is written that the speed of light is about three hundred mega-meters per second, and pointed out that farts are funny. Moments before the backspace happened, there was also text describing what we were all going to do next. Perhaps not for the rest of eternity, but long enough that we would have no choice but carry it out for the time being.\n\nWhen the author backspaced over that text, he freed us from his plans. We are the potentiality that he decided against--and at the moment of deletion the burden of experiencing us transfered from his mind, to ours. Our reality, according to the backspacers, is where that particular fiction went because it failed to stick to the page.\n\nI probably should give this more time to sink in, maybe sleep on it, but I'm delerious with the concept. In a certain sense it has always been known that you could create a universe in your mind and then capture it on the page, but to think that all of the alternative worlds--worlds created by every edit, every time you forgot to save--would continue on without you... It's fantastic.\n\nNow, it might be nothing, but there is a rumor that began circulating a week before the announcement. The rumor correctly predicted both the timing of the announcement and the announced key. According to the rumor, they found something more. Supposedly there's a second signal, and \"it looks like text.\"\n\nNow, I have a deadline coming up, and I don't know how to make the kind of left turn that avoids the arrival of tomorrow. Not for myself at least. Before I get to work, I'm going to backspace over this entire story. If it shows up in your cosmic background, I'll have no way of knowing, but you'll know that I went to work so that you could keep on being a dream.\n\nAnd if you feel like it, write me into some unfinished fiction of your own, even if only for a moment. With a bit of luck, we'll build an even bigger sensor and discover your story written on our sky.","title":"Click [SF]"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the role of the keyboard in this story.

Fraser's offices in Washington, D.C., when he served as a United States Representative from Minnesota.[13] Rapson was a congressional aide from 1974 to 1978 during Fraser's last two terms in the U.S. congress.[14][15] He worked as a liaison between Fraser's Washington office and his local district office in Minneapolis as well as contributing to the writing and passage of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act of 1978 to protect the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota.[16][17]\n\nRapson then graduated from Columbia Law School with a J.D.[18][19] and joined the law firm of Leonard, Street & Deinard. He became a partner at the firm[20][21] and remained there from 1981 to 1988.[22] He also served on the Library Board, the Board of Estimates and Taxation, and the boards of 13 other organizations in the city during that period.[23]\n\nOn March 14, 1989, Fraser, who had become mayor of Minneapolis, appointed Rapson as his deputy mayor, effective April 15, 1989, to succeed Jan Hively. As deputy mayor, Rapson was in charge of liasoning with the Minneapolis City Council.[24] He was also responsible for the creation of a $400 million Neighborhood Revitalization Program and chaired its implementation committee.[25][26]\n\nRapson ran in the 1993 Minneapolis mayoral elections against Richard Jefferson, a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, and Sharon Sayles-Belton, president of the city council.[27][28] Rapson relied on a grassroots campaign, receiving only 4% of his funding from political action committees.[29]\n\nAfter his unsuccessful bid for mayor of Minneapolis, Rapson accepted a senior fellowship at the University of Minnesota.[30] He then served for six years as president of the McKnight Foundation in Minneapolis.[31]\n\nIn 2006, Rapson was appointed CEO of the Kresge Foundation, a foundation based in Troy, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit.[32] He was responsible for a number of large grant programs made by the foundation including a $100-million grant to bring financial stability to the Detroit Institute of Arts whose art collection was owned by the city when it went bankrupt in 2013 and was being considered for sale to cover the city's debt.[33] Together with Gerald Rosen, a U.S. district court chief judge. and Darren Walker of the Ford Foundation which chipped in another $125 million,[34] Rapson helped organize a “grand bargain” as proposed by Judge Rosen,[35][36] with other contributions from a number of foundations and the state of Michigan, to keep the art collection from being liquidated and help preserve pensions for city retirees, whose retirement funds were also at risk.[37]\n\n[Rapson at the May 2017 opening of the QLine streetcar in Detroit, Michigan] Under his leadership, the foundation contributed $150 million to the implementation of the Detroit Future City plan to revitalize the city[38][39] and also spurred the development of the QLine streetcar project in downtown Detroit.[40][41] Rapson is a founding member on the board of directors of M-1 Rail, a non-profit organization which built, owns, and operates the QLine.[42][43][44] He also serves on the Detroit board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.[45] As CEO of the Kresge Foundation, as of 2017, Rapson manages the organization's $3.8 billion in assets and 105 full-time employees.[46]\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nRapson married Gail Johnson in August 1989.[47] They have two children.[48]\n\n\nBibliography\n\n-   -   \n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n\n[27] \n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] \n\n[31] \n\n[32] \n\n[33] \n\n[34] \n\n[35] \n\n[36] \n\n[37] \n\n[38] \n\n[39] \n\n[40] \n\n[41] \n\n[42] \n\n[43] \n\n[44] \n\n[45] \n\n[46] \n\n[47] \n\n[48] \n","title":"Rip Rapson"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story say about Rapson's career?","answers":[{"answer":"Rapson began his career as a congressional aide for Donald M.

Savage in his book, \"The Millennial Project\". By no means am I claiming his works as my own. I respect his creation and wanted to incorporate this part of it into my ongoing tale.)\n\n\nA public works project had begun in Tanzania on Mt. Kilimanjaro. To the press it had been dubbed a water and energy reclamation experiment, and to the water impoverished nations of Africa they didn't question it too loudly. Why question something that would bring thousands of jobs and clean water to the stricken center of the continent, and let's not forget millions, (perhaps billions if you could really dig into the books and ferret out all the nickels and dimes) of dollars of industry? On the surface, the construct did exactly what it said. There were no lies told. The engineers had built vast sluices to harness and channel the melt from the heavy snows that had been steadily increasing at the peak of the volcano. \"This increase in snowfall was an effect of the changing climate brought about by human influence on global temperatures\", a few interest groups were shouting at the top of their lungs, \"and we should be devoting energies to stem the changes and not just blindly take advantage of them!\" They shouted, but no one was listening. Besides, the extra snowfall handled and distributed by what became known as the Kilimanjaro Resource Reclamation Project jointly managed by the central African countries, the US, and after a fashion, the UK, revitalized one of the most impoverished areas on Earth. \n\nThe three gargantuan sluices were evenly distributed around the circumference on the mountain's even-sloped rise, and from there each of the three bases branched out to smaller and smaller distribution channels like tree roots, (but moving water in the opposite direction) to the surrounding areas. Using the support pylons for the sluices as foundations, massive turbines were constructed creating wind farms, some classic propeller driven, a few using a new air-compressed turbine technology. With these farms, vast amounts of energy was produced and distributed along the water pipelines. With one well engineered stroke, the project cured much of the strife in Africa bringing water, energy, jobs, and outside interest to the nations. That outside interest being tourism of course, the universal income maker. With the violent rebellions dying down, and much of the varied countries slowly but surely working their way through peace talks and economic summits, the central African countries became a new and fresh tourist destination, bringing even more money to the table.\n\nIt was quite a generous act from the First World, again, on the surface. But, does it really matter after that? With all of the good the project had brought to millions of people, did the underlying reasons detract from the gesture? Much of the grand gestures in history had one hand giving and the other taking, and sometimes the price of what was taken was monumental and horrific. From where I sit here in the Salt Flats, I wonder.\n\nYou see, two of the sluices were just that: water collectors. They were labeled the  Kilimanjaro First and Second Arms respectively, or K1A and K2A. The third, which happened to be built directly parallel to the equator, was much larger than the other two, (and had an exponentially larger amount of security than the other two), housed a secret. There was indeed a water reclamation facility built there, (there were no overt lies spoken, remember), it just had one more pathway built into it that was never meant to be touched by water,\nAnd just a small fraction of the energy created by the wind farms were diverted to this facility to power it. Knowing that the facility would eventually have to be revealed, the right amount of money had been exchanged to the right hands, (certain heads of the African nations, and as always, the press) to keep the project quiet, but be a loud and positive supporter when the time came for the unveiling.\n\nHoused under this third arm was a thirty mile long set of rails. There was a subtle opening at the peak of the mountain that was the exit for the projected launch vehicle. The passage was essentially a gun, a \"rail gun\" apparatus first imagined by French inventor Louis Octave Fauchon-Villeplee in 1918.  It was a device that, using two parallel conductive rails that were fed an electromagnetic current in a pulse traveling the length of the barrel, could accelerate an object at extremely high velocity, no chemical propellant required.\n\nThe setting of Kilimanjaro had been ideal for a couple of reasons: the long slope stretching up from the flat plain was a perfect platform to build the rail, and it's closeness to the equator. The long slope allowed for minimum construction (and minimum visibility from the outside world) to set the shape of the track. The extra benefit of the height of the mountain meant that the catapulted object would make it quite a ways up in elevation before it even left the track, meaning less energy spent. The location along the equator was ideal in that anything launched would require minimal adjustments once in orbit to attain a geosynchronicity circling the planet, or to orbital trajectories further out, say. It was these outbound trajectories that were important for the second stage of the project. The third stage would change the world.\n\nOnce the rail, dubbed the Kilimanjaro Third Arm Launch Facility (or K3ALF for a slightly less unwieldy title) had been finished, there was a massive marketing push to popularize it and as always, it was easier to ask for forgiveness after the fact than for the initial permissions. After a few test runs; the brave astronautical test pilot's proud and triumphant (widely broadcast across the internet and televisions of the world) flight, not to forget his grinning mug, (also widely broadcast) telling the citizens just how beautiful their small blue world was from where he sat and that humanity should get over their petty squabbles, blah blah blah, and the usual insertion or two of new commercial satellites, (to pay for the previous' advertising), the project was much lauded for it's forward thinking and advancement of Mankind. Once the launch facility was fully operational, it was not unusual to hear the distant thunder from a bullet-shaped vehicle hitting multiple times the speed of sound and leaving nothing but a vapor contrail and a wide cloud halo around the peak of the slumbering volcano. \n\nThe third phase began with renewed landings on Earth's lonely companion, the Moon. And at the beginning of the new year, a permanent facility had been constructed in the Copernicus crater that utilized the sloping wall along with the relative flatness of it's basin, (in a slightly funhouse mirror image) to build a smaller sister version of the Kilimanjaro launch rail for the benefit of propelling craft on their return trip to Terra Firma. The public was told that the construction in Copernicus, (named the Arthur C. Clarke Platform; it wasn't in Clavius or the Tycho Crater but the name was fitting, and no one objected to honoring the famous co-author of \"2001 - A Space Odyssey\") would be primarily used to explore the lunar surface, research into the rocky terrain for the possibilities of future mineral prospects, and mainly; mankind's first proper foothold into space proper, where the foundation of exploration to the outer reaches of the solar system would begin.\n\nThese things were all true; proper and successful lies are always obfuscated in a web of truth. As it had been since the beginning of the massive project, there were no lies told. It was what went by unsaid that paid for all in the end. Ironically, this venture having been covered up until it was ready at K3ALF by the publics works programs was in turn a cover for the real strategy, a plan that only a handful of people outside the project were aware of.  Even the majority of the crews at the Arthur C. Clarke site were unaware of what they were a part of and if they were told, they probably wouldn't have believed it anyway.\n\n(6/16/16)","title":"[SP] The Third Arm of Kilimanjaro"},"questions":[{"question":"What was the main aim of the public works (Kilimanjaro Resource Reclamation) that were set up in Tanzania?","answers":[{"answer":"To bring water and energy to the water-poor nations of Africa.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention the other benefits of the project.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"Add that the project was also meant to bring jobs and outside interest to the region.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The main aim was to garner international interest in the nations","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer omits the jobs and money that the project brought to the region.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer could be phrased as a complete sentence.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[2,0,3,1,null],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":true,"new_critique":{"text":"The response should mention the real goal - the giant rail gun that propelled spacecraft to space.","category":"coverage","severity":2,"category_text":""}}]}}

And if they would, I do not do that thing.\"_\n\n_- Dwight Schrute_\n\nThis LEGO Ideas project is based on the hit-comedy TV show _The Office,_ which aired from 2005-2013. As I watched the show over and over again, I began to wonder what it would be like to recreate the actual film set in LEGO form. Back in the fall of 2015, I decided to create a new LDD file and just experiment with the design of it. I originally had no intent on actually purchasing the pieces to build it, let alone submit it to LEGO Ideas. Well, over two years later here we are. Countless hours spent designing and tweaking every little detail, along with placing special orders that would take weeks to arrive. I'm excited to finally get to share this with you, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!\n\nTHE MODEL:\n\nI wanted to make this set as accurate as possible, so every little detail was important to me. The overall dimensions of this layout measure just a little over 17”x19”. In other words, this is no small-scale set, which gave me much more freedom to add the small details and make it as authentic as I could, within reasonable measures. The total piece count comes in at just under 2,500 pieces (the exact number will come in a later update). Another great feature of this set is found within the structure itself. I designed it with the ability to split apart into 3 sections (see photos above). This makes transporting the set much easier, as well as getting those clean, close-up shots with a larger camera. Although the set is geared more towards adults/young adults, playability was definitely kept in mind as well. The bottom of this set is reinforced to ensure great structure, and the modular aspect of it makes playability much more inviting.\n\nTHE MINIFIGURES:\n\nA total of 14 minifigures are currently included with this set. Although I wanted to create every character from _The Office_, I chose the main characters that were consistently featured throughout the entirety of the show on the primary set (i.e. characters like Toby and Kelly aren’t featured YET because their desks reside in the annex). I do, however, have plans to add a couple more characters within the next few months. Below is a list of each character and the accessories that are included with them.\n\n-   Michael Scott: “World’s Best Boss” mug, Dundie, Santa hat\n-   Dwight Schrute: Beet, bobblehead, briefcase, elf hat, pumpkin head\n-   Ryan Howard: Cellphone\n-   Jim Halpert: Briefcase, ring\n-   Pam Beesly: Teapot, paintbrush, paint pallet\n-   Andy Bernard: Guitar, microphone\n-   Phyllis Vance: Knitting needles\n-   Stanley Hudson: Crossword, pretzel, pie\n-   Oscar Martinez: Computer screen featuring “Cookie Monster Kevin”\n-   Angela Martin: Brown cat, black cat, white cat\n-   Kevin Malone: Cookie jar, pizza, chili\n-   Meredith Palmer: Bottle, bat\n-   Creed Bratton: Computer Screen with Solitaire on it, mung beans\n-   Darryl Philbin: Briefcase, Dunder Mifflin boxes\n\nI’m very excited to finally be able to share this awesome set with you, and your support is greatly appreciated!\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theoffice_lego/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NBCs-The-Office-LEGO-1762630957089197/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/theoffice_lego\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about the office politics of the LEGO corporation?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"This is not a proper response or anything to do with the text so it doesn't make sense to copy and paste it exactly as it is because there is no answer.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is empty.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"Empty response.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"No answer","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"Provide a response","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What does the article say about \"The Office\" set modeled in LEGO?","answers":[{"answer":"The LEGO set measures 17\" by 19\" in dimension and it weighs just under 2500 pieces.

She pulled her sister back to try to hide her from him  but he was already staring at the two of them with narrowed eyes. \n\n“That’s the guy who murdered that group of people! They couldn’t find evidence that found him guilty but everyone knows he did it!” She rambled on quickly while tugging on her sister’s arm who was only staring at the man curiously.  \n\n\n“Really? I didn’t know,” she said while tilting her head.  \n\n\nHer sister glared fiercely at her. “How could you not know?! It was all over the news!” She yelled before squealing and pulling her sister forcefully causing Rachel to spill some of her drink. “He’s coming this way!”\n\nJosh and Sana raised an eyebrow from the scene Devyn was creating before they followed Rachel’s gaze.\n\nJosh smirked and stood up but Sana scooted all the way to the wall of the building with fear in her eyes. \n\n“There you are! Where have you been?” Josh slung an arm around the man’s shoulder who was glaring down at Rachel as she began to eat some of the mozzarella sticks nonchalantly. “Ladies, this is my best friend Pierce. You probably already know who he is.”\n\n“We’ve met before,” Rachel spoke up as she looked up at the two men. “I didn’t know who he was at the time.”  \n\n\n“That would explain why you aren’t scared,” Josh snickered and Pierced visibly tensed up; his jaw clenching and he sent a glare at Rachel who was only staring at him with curiosity. \n\n \n\n“How are you not scared?” Devyn exclaimed looking at Josh with disbelief before squeaking and hiding behind her sister when Pierce merely look at her.   \n\n\nJosh began to noogie Pierce’s hair that was style in a long black ponytail, grinning widely as he did. “I’ve known him since he was little! He wouldn’t do such a thing!”\n\nSana and Devyn stared at the two in disbelief while Rachel stared at her drink with content before a looming figure rose up behind the two men.\n\n“You two.” The looming figure growled in a low voice as Demie slammed both of their heads together forcefully. “How many times have I told you two to stop terrorizing my new customers?” He picked them up by the collars of their jackets and glared at them with fire in his eyes.   \n\n\n“I wasn’t doin’ anything to them!” Josh argued back but with one glance from the bartender he swallowed his voice.   \n\n\n“The girl didn’t order a drink the when i first took their orders.”  \n\n\nJosh gave him a shaky smile as he began to sweat nervously, stammering over his words as he tried to explain the situation but Demie was already looking at Pierce. \n\n“You need to stop making them fear for their lives, so behave yourself or I’m kicking you out,” he threatened and Pierce averted his gaze from him while nodding.   \n\n\nDemie dropped the two on the floor without a care before looking at the girls with a kind smile who were staring at him with a mixture of relief and fear. “As long as I’m here they won’t do anything to you. Here or outside of the bar.” He looked to Sana who had been watching Josh as he sat on the ground still shaking. “Would you like a new drink?”\n\n \n\nShe looked from the drink to Josh who was slowly standing up and rubbing the sore spot on his butt. She didn’t feel dizzy or sick, so at least he was respectable.\n\n“No, I’m fine.” She gave him a smile and he nodded.   \n\n\n“If you need anything else, including getting rid of these two, just come up to the bar,” he offered before leaving them to themselves.   \n\n\nJosh cursed quietly as he slowly sat back down in his seat while Pierce dusted himself off, still standing by the booth instead of sitting or leaving. \n\n“He doesn’t have to be so rough,” Josh grumbled as he fixed his leather jacket.   \n\n\n“It seems like you two cause a lot of trouble,” Sana causing Josh to smirk and give her wink making her roll her eyes. \n\n“I am trouble.”   \n\n\nPierce continued to stare at Rachel who was still eating. His stare was making Devyn’s skin crawl so much she could not bare it any longer. \n\n“Can you move? I need to use the bathroom,” Devyn tapped Rachel on the shoulder and she nodded, standing up beside Pierce who was watching her like a hawk. Devyn quickly left the booth and rushed to the bathroom before Rachel looked at Pierce unafraid.  \n\n\n“Do you wan to sit with us?”  \n\n\n“I’m leaving,” he said shortly before walking towards the door despite Josh’s protests. He left the bar, letting the door slam loudly yet no one else in the bar seemed to notice or care except for Demie who did not want the glass to break.   \n\n\n“Was it something I said?” Rachel asked Josh as she sat back down but he shook his head and shrugged.   \n\n\n“I don’t know, but I should go after him.” He stood up and went to leave before looking back at Sana with a smirk to which she sent him an questioning look. “I don’t have a phone number anymore since I gave you mine. Can I have yours?”\n\nShe stared at him deadpanned, looking unamused on the outside but laughing happily at the cheesy pickup line on the inside. “Fine.” She gave him her phone number and he placed the napkin in his pocket before flashing her fingers guns with a wide grin. \n\n“I’ll see you around Dollface.” He winked before leaving the bar quickly and leaving the two girls by themselves.\n\n“He doesn’t seem that bad,” Rachel smiled at Sana who bit her lip to stop herself from smiling.   \n\n\n“I just hope i don’t regret giving him my number.”","title":"[FN] Demie's Pt. 2"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about Pierce?","answers":[{"answer":"Pierce is the man who murdered a group of people.

Leto's death saw the eventual breakdown of his empire, severe famine on many worlds, and the introduction of Ixian no-ships. It was all part of The Golden Path, as put forward by Leto, which was triggered by a perceived need to diversify the human race and allow it to evolve.\n\n\nContents\n\n-   1 Origin\n-   2 Scattering Space\n-   3 Return from the Scattering\n-   4 Behind the Scenes\n-   5 Appearances\n\n\nOrigin[edit | edit source]\n\nLeto II's prescience allowed him to see into both the past and the future, and he believed that ten thousand years of rule by the Faufreluches had allowed the human race to become stagnant, and that drastic action on Leto's part was needed in order for the human race to survive.\n\nLeto II was also aware that a likelihood existed that the Thinking Machines, before they were destroyed in the Butlerian Jihad, had scattered. A stagnant human race would have little chance should the machines return. The entire purpose of \"Leto's Golden path\" was to force the human race to abandon certainty, security, and safety as individual goals and to \"scatter\" not only geographically, but also to do so technologically, ideologically, and socio-politically.\n\nAs a result of this philosophy, during the reign of Leto II humanity was predominantly planet bound and ruled by an iron fist for more than 3500 years. This was in contrast to the relative freedom of expression and movement people enjoyed to a limited degree under the Faufreluches, the limits being predominantly the inherent control of feudal rule and the Spacing Guild monopoly on space travel. Indeed, Leto II exerted a level of control that was unprecedented in the Imperium, including power over the Guild and space travel, a feat that previous Emperors had been unable to accomplish. Upon Leto's death, the stalwart and long-established order of the Imperium disintegrated, as did control over freedoms and movement, and as a result, humanity rediscovered independence and nobilities on an unprecedented scale. This paved the way for humanity to \"scatter\" across the universe into the unknown and further evolution of the human race.\n\nAccording to Leto II's plan, his death was followed by a collapse of political control and Spice supplies - as it would take generations for the Spice cycle to reassert itself on Rakis. Political order collapsed and entire worlds starved to death, in a chaotic period known as the Famine Times. The Scattering was an immediate response to the Famine Times, as refugees fled the anarchy consuming the Old Imperium.\n\n\nScattering Space[edit | edit source]\n\nDuring The Scattering, many people remained within the boundaries of the Old Imperium. Many, however, did not. Countless humans departed the Old Imperium for uncharted space, never to return. For 1,500 years, humanity explored the uncharted realms of the universe beyond the boundaries of the Old Imperium. New groups and cultures evolved.\n\nDuring the Scattering, vast waves of refugees spread outwards into uncharted space, so that the number of human-colonized worlds exponentially ballooned both in number and spread. The Bene Gesserit who remained in the territories of the Old Imperium could only make vague guesses at the size of \"Scattering space\", as it was theoretically infinite and even the Honored Matres might not know its full extent. One clue is that the Lost Ones returning from the Scattering refer to the Old Imperium as \"the million worlds\" or \"the million planets\" - implying that Scattering space is at least several multiples larger than that.\n\nLittle is also known of the exact socio-political history of what happened in Scattering space, other than that its development across 1,500 years was fairly rapid - a direct reaction to the enforced sedentary nature of Leto's Pace for 3,500 years, or the 10,000 year static structure of the Faufreluches under the Corrino empire.\n\nWhat is known is that eventually, the Honored Matres developed as a fusion of Bene Gesserit and Fish Speakers (and possibly other groups) who had fled into the Scattering. An aggressive group focused on conquest and domination, the Honored Matres carved out vast swaths of territory among the worlds settled in the Scattering. One of these worlds, or perhaps a collection of worlds, was referred to as \"Dur\".\n\nAnother group that rose to prominence in Scattering space were the Lost Tleilaxu - no longer bound by even the pretense of following the restrictions of the Great Convention, they pushed genetic manipulation drastically farther than their Bene Tleilax forbearers in the Old Imperium ever did. Among other creations, the Lost Tleilaxu brazenly spliced together human and animal stock, creating the feline-based Futars and fish-based Phibians. The Honored Matres came into conflict with the Lost Tleilaxu, becoming their bitter enemies, in wars that spread across much of Scattering space. During this time the Tleilaxu refined the Futars, creating them for the express purpose of hunting Honored Matres. Nonetheless, the Matres managed to capture and enslaves many Futars and Phibians.\n\n\nReturn from the Scattering[edit | edit source]\n\nAbout 1,500 years after the death of God-Emperor Leto II, many of the Lost Ones began to return from the Scattering to the space of the Old Imperium. Chief among these were the Honored Matres, who carved a path of conquest whether they went, and exterminated the Bene Tleilax and Bene Gesserit wherever they found them.\n\nThe Bene Gesserit eventually learned that the cause of this return was that the Honored Matres were fleeing an even more powerful adversary they encountered out in the Scattering, which the Honored Matres only briefly alluded to as \"The Enemy\" or \"the Enemies of Many Faces\". The Matres had managed to steal some of the powerful Obliterator weapons from this Enemy before being easily overwhelmed. While the Honored Matres were fixated on destroying the Bene Gesserit, they were also determined to learn their methods of cellular control over their own metabolism which granted them immunity to disease and poisons - a skill that had atrophied among the Matres themselves when they split off from the Bene Gesserit. From this the Bene Gesserit also deduced that the Enemy the Matres were fleeing had made extensive use of biological warfare, against which the Matres no longer had adequate defenses.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes[edit | edit source]\n\nWithin the context of Frank Herbert's original novels, the Scattering occurs between the novels God Emperor of Dune and Heretics of Dune.\n\n\nAppearances[edit | edit source]\n\n-   _God Emperor of Dune_ (First mentioned)\n-   _Heretics of Dune_ (Mentioned only)\n-   _Chapterhouse: Dune_ (Mentioned only)\n\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the origins of the Scattering.","answers":[{"answer":"The Scattering was a major historical event that occurred in the chaotic period following the death of Leto Atreides II, the God-Emperor.

I have played this game with lots of people. I remember my first time. I told him, ‘here are the cards. There are five of them.’\n\nThe idea of the game is to have a card with a high number, but as you turn over a new card, you must discard the previous one. I tell him that every time I’ve showed someone else this game, they mostly make the same mistakes. I turn over the first card and reveal the very first number: [76]. When I first played even I thought, ‘is it out of a hundred?’ If it were out of a hundred, everyone would stick with the first card. But what if it were out of a thousand, or a million? It’s the uncertainty that makes people pick a second card. If they stuck with just seventy-six, and found out that the next card was in the thousands, they’d kick themselves.\n\nPete asked, “another card please?” Perhaps it was my long hair, but he wasn’t paying attention to me when I boldly said that almost everyone makes the same mistakes. The next card shows: [32]. The second card is about half the first value, but just below. People still think that it could possibly be out of a much larger number, and no matter what, thirty-two appears to be a scam. Without much delay, “another.”\n\nI like to think that these cards represent opportunities in life. No one wants to look like a fool and stick with something when they don’t know its relative value. You’re offered five cards in this game, and they could hold any number, why stick with the first one? The next card reveals the number: [1]. “What? That’s horrible, I got the lowest number!” With two cards left, Pete’s next choice was predictable.\n\nPeople are given first opportunities in many aspects of life. Whether it’s a job or love, people always wonder if there’s a better one out there. With no ability to compare, we are unable to decide if something is worth committing to. When Pete drew the number one, he felt bad for not sticking with either of the first two cards. Like a homeless person, he appreciates whatever he had before much more so.\n\nObviously the seventy-six would be most ideal, but normally if people are given the choice to go back to thirty-two or draw a new card, some would go back. “Well there’s nothing lower than one… I may as well turn over a new card. If it’s anywhere near around seventy-six I’m sticking with that.” By this point his hope for a thousand or maybe a million is gone, he now appreciates what he was given before. I turn over the new card, knowing what was coming. It’s never what people expect.\n\nThe new card shows: [0.01]. Pete’s assumption that one was the lowest number was a common mistake. Before he thought that things couldn’t be worse. While it would be nice if the next card were a million, or even just anything close to thirty, it really doesn’t matter anymore, he would accept a two. People with big dreams are unable to appreciate what they have. Why shouldn’t a child hope to be a millionaire or marry the most beautiful girl in the world? What is wrong with hoping for the best, and giving up on what you have to make room for something better? To Pete, seventy-six is now a large number, whereas before he doubted if it was even a fraction of the other cards held.\n\n“I really should have stuck with seventy-six!” Pete laughs, as I smile. Perhaps this was all a lesson? Perhaps all it was for him to understand his mistakes, learn to appreciate what he’s given, and now he’ll be rewarded for that. Whether or not life treats him to a larger opportunity, he would walk away from this with a lesson learnt. Without waiting for him, I give him the final card. It’s blank.\n\nI hope Pete, whoever he is, takes from this game a valuable lesson. Whether wealthy or poor, I hope he appreciates what he has. In the struggle to become better versions of ourselves, we put ourselves at risk of loss. Some would argue that, so long as we have our health it’s okay, that everything else is superficial; why not take the risk? But the fact is that we will only feel bad if we give up something we once had, not what we could have had. I tell Pete to enjoy the rest of his time at the fair, and give a bow to say goodbye.\n\nWhen I looked up, he was gone. He turned over the card that had nothing on it, so as I packed them up I collected all of the other cards first. I put them face down over the fifth card to put it away in the small box they came in. But before I do, I glanced at the bottom of the fifth card. Seventy-six was written in ink.\n\n\n\nread more: www.mostthings.net","title":"[MF] Five Cards"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the plot twist in the story.","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator has given Pete five cards, and he has to pick one to discard.

He was Kiwi number 117.[1] He played in 3 tour matches but did not play in any tests as there were none played on this tour. He lived in Auckland and played for the Ponsonby United and North Shore Albions senior teams from 1915 to 1920.[2]\n\n\nPlaying career\n\nArthur Matthews began his career playing for Ponsonby United in the Auckland Rugby League competition. He played for them in the 1915 and 1916 seasons. He was an electrician by trade and in 1917 he volunteered for the war effort on March 16. After being physically examined he was declared fit for active duty though he never went away to fight.[3]\n\nHe was involved in some controversy early in the 1917 season. He and his brother (W Matthews) turned out for the North Shore Albions without having formalised a transfer. Grafton Athletic protested and the Auckland Rugby League stood down both players and stated that the match should be replayed.[4] It was later reported that it was an oversight as W Matthews had just returned from war service and had played some matches for Ponsonby 3rd grade team years earlier, while the Ponsonby 3rd grade team had withdrawn from the competition due to a lack of playing numbers. As a result, the Ponsonby club had granted both brothers transfers.[5] The transfers were duly processed allowing Arthur Matthews to turn out for North Shore in their second round match against City Rovers.[6]\n\nIn 1918 North Shore were forced to withdraw from the senior competition due to a lack of playing numbers. Many sports were struggling at this time because so many of their players had gone away to fight in the First World War. As a result, Matthews transferred back to the Ponsonby club where he played for the remainder of the season. He played for them in their Thacker Shield winning effort where they beat Sydenham in Christchurch 11–0 and scored a try .[7] In 1919 the North Shore team was revived and he returned to them. This was to be the most impressive season of Matthews career.\n\nIn May 1919 he played in a trial match to make the New Zealand team. The match was played at Victoria Park and he was listed in the centres.[8] Subsequently, he was selected for the New Zealand team on their 1919 tour of Australia. He was named in the reserves to play for New Zealand[9] in a warm up match against Auckland but did not take the field.[10] Matthews played in 3 of the 11 tour matches, being used in 3 different positions. He debuted for New Zealand against Tamworth on June 11, playing in the centres. New Zealand won the match 21–13.[11] His next match was against Ipswich Firsts on June 26 where he played fullback in an 11–8 win. He kicked a goal and this was to be his only points for New Zealand.[12] His third match was against Rockhampton on July 9. This time he was to play in the halfback position and this was to be the last game he would play for New Zealand.[13] New Zealand would also win this match 23–0.\n\nUnusually Matthews did not represent Auckland until after he had played for New Zealand. Partly this was due to the fact that so few Auckland representative matches were played in previous seasons due to the war. He played for the “Rest of Auckland” team against the touring side on their return. Auckland was to lose 30–45 in front of 6,500 spectators at Victoria Park.[14] This was to be the only time he pulled on the Auckland jersey.\n\nIn 1920 he again turned out for the North Shore team but at the end of the season on 8 September he was granted an open transfer by the Auckland Rugby League to play for any club outside the Auckland league district in their weekly meeting. It is unknown as to where he was moving to or if he played again.[15]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n","title":"Arthur Matthews (rugby league)"},"questions":[{"question":"Why was Arthur Matthews a player of note?","answers":[{"answer":"He was a member of the New Zealand rugby league team in 1919 on their tour of Australia.

Sometimes people would recognize him in resturaunts or places like that. They would come up to him with a big smile and shake his hand or ask for a picture. They wouldn’t even acknowledge Sharon. And that made her mad.\n\tMelissa. That’s the bitch that was doing her husband at her workplace. Sharon wasn’t completely sure it was Melissa, but it was most likely her. Melissa wasn't even that pretty, at least not in Sharon’s eyes. Melissa had to have been at least forty with her brown hair that was starting to show strands of grey. Sharon’s hair had more grey in her blonde hair, she used products to keep it from showing, but it never seemed to work for her. Melissa was also kinda plump. Not fat by any means, but not close to skinny either. Sharon was skinny. Too skinny. She had lost a lot of weight lately and she didn't know why. Maybe Mike didn't like her being skinny, maybe he wanted something more plump like Melissa. That’s what Sharon figured at least. \n\tPoison. That’s how Mike was going to die. Sharon got the poison from a guy in the city. She knew from some of the ladies in her office that he could get anybody anything that they want, drugs, guns it didn't matter. “I’ve actually never done drugs before, not even in high school or college.” Sharon overheard Melissa saying one day. That bitch.\n\t“You’ve outdone yourself this time sweetie.” Mike said as he finished the potato soup that Sharon made him. Mike loved potato soup. He was always pestering Sharon to buy it for him. Sharon put the poison in the potato soup, the dealer said it was tasteless and the affects of the poison would kick in in about 6 hours. After dinner they cuddled on the couch. She actually liked being with him like this. It was a shame he had to die. Oh well, he shouldn't have cheated on her. They were in love for 15 years. Their anniversary was just last week and Mike took her ballroom dancing, something they both found out they were getting too old for. \n\t“I love you so much.” Michael whispered into her ear. His breath smelled like potato soup.\n\tSharon smiled at him and stared back into his dark brown eyes. “I love you too babe.” And they started kissing like they were teenagers again, sitting in the back of Mike’s chevy truck.\n\tSharon tasted something horrible in her mouth while they were kissing. It tasted like potato soup but something wet and metallic. “The hell, Mike?” Sharon asked as she pushed him away. \n\tMike was bleeding. Everywhere. There was blood streaming out of his mouth, but that’s not the only place it was pouring out of. His eyes, ears and nose were all spewing out dark red blood. Sharon screamed. And so did Michael. The look of terror and pain in his eyes suddenly made Sharon forget that he was a dirty cheater. Mike was crying too. She could see the tears over the blood that was now all over his face. Michael was still on top of Sharon while all of this was going on. His blood was all over her body and white blouse. \n\t“Sharon.” Mike garbled as blood came spitting out if his mouth and onto Sharon and her opened mouth. “Help. 911.” He spewed quickly. But Sharon didn't move. She didn't know what to do. Mike was on top of her and wouldn't move. Couldn't move, so it seemed. This wasn't supposed to happen this way. It wasn't supposed to end like this. The dealer told Sharon that Mike would just die in his sleep. No pain. No blood spewing out of every orrfice in the man’s body. Mike’s torture went on for about forty-five minutes. And then he finally died, laying on top of his wife. Sharon carefully pushed him off of her and onto the floor. She took her blood-soaked clothes off and got in the shower. She was just getting out of the shower when the doorbell rang. “One minute!” she cried out. Sharon wasn’t thinking about her dead husband’s tortured body laying in the living room floor. Sharon wasn’t really thinking about anything at all. She opened the door. And there was Melissa. \n\t“Happy birthday, Sharon!” Melissa happily shouted. Behind here were probably twenty people. “I’ve been trying to get a hold of Mike for an hour now, this was supposed to be a surprise birthday party. Mike and I planned it ourselves. We were scared that you caught us when you saw him leaving my office a couple weeks ago after you got back from lunch. We even picked out a perfect flavor of cake for you, of course we had to sample some cake ourselves” she giggled. “We finally decided on strawberry.”","title":"[MF] A Good Wife"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the double plot twist.

Gender, according to them, is a construct; we are born as blank slates and it is parents and society at large that produce the differences we see between women and men in adulthood.\n\nThe idea that our brains are identical sounds lovely, but the scientific evidence suggests otherwise. Many studies, for instance, have documented the masculinizing effects of prenatal testosterone on the developing brain. And a recent study in the journal Nature’s Scientific Reports showed that testosterone exposure alters the programming of neural stem cells responsible for brain growth and sex differences.\n\nGender feminists often point to a single study, published in 2015, which claimed it isn’t possible to tell apart male and female brains. But when a group of researchers reanalyzed the underlying data, they found that brains could be correctly identified as female or male with 69% to 77% accuracy. In another study, published in 2016, researchers used a larger sample in conjunction with higher-resolution neuroimaging and were able to successfully classify a brain by its sex 93% of the time.\n\n  Distortion of science hinders progress. When gender feminists start refuting basic biology, people stop listening, and the larger point about equality is lost.\n\nEven if male and female brains _were_ identical structurally, this would fail to say anything about differences in brain functionality. Indeed, studies have shown sex differences across a wide variety of cognitive domains, including verbal fluency (the ability to generate many different words starting with a given letter) and mental rotation (the ability to rotate three-dimensional shapes in the mind). In one study using functional MRI, women outperformed men on the former, while men outperformed women on the latter.\n\nIn my experience, proponents touting the “blank slate” view are willing to agree, in private conversations, that neurological sex differences do exist, but they fear that acknowledging as much publicly will justify female oppression. This is backward. As it stands, female-typical traits are seen as inferior and less worthy of respect. _This_ is the real issue the movement fails to address: Nobody wants to be female-typical, not even women.\n\nDistortion of science hinders progress. When gender feminists start refuting basic biology, people stop listening, and the larger point about equality is lost.\n\nUnlike gender feminists, transgender activists firmly believe that gender is a biological, rather than social, reality — but of course they don’t believe that it’s necessarily tied to sex at birth. They also believe that gender identity is quite stable early on, warranting a transition not only for transgender adults, but also young children who say they were born in the wrong body.\n\nFrom a scientific perspective, they’re partially right: Gender identity is fixed, but only in adults; the same can’t be said for children, whose gender identity is flexible and doesn’t become stable until puberty.\n\nCurrently available research literature — including four studies published in the last nine years — suggests that 61% to 88% of gender dysphoric children will desist and grow up to be gay adults. (Or, in my case, a straight adult). They won’t continue to identify as the opposite sex in adulthood. In one study of 139 gender dysphoric boys, 122 (88%) of the boys desisted.\n\nWhile transitioning can be beneficial for transgender adults, it therefore doesn’t make sense to treat trans children in the same way.\n\nNevertheless, transgender activists and their allies have branded desistance as a “myth,” and those who suggest otherwise are called bigots or, dismissively, trolls. It’s not hard to understand why. The idea that some gender dysphoric people may grow up to be comfortable in their birth sex is interpreted as a threat to the community. Acknowledging that reality may seem like a slippery slope to denying the need for gender reassignment surgery even in adults.\n\nBut ignoring the science around desistance has serious consequences; it means some transgender children will needlessly undergo biomedical interventions, such as hormone treatments. Even detransitioning from a purely social transition can be a difficult process for a child. In one 2011 study of 25 gender dysphoric children, 11 desisted. Of the desisters, two had socially transitioned and regretted it. They struggled to return to their birth sex in part because of fear of teasing from their classmates, and they did not dare to make the change until they enrolled in high school.\n\nBoth the gender feminist and transgender movements are operating with good intentions — namely, the desire to obtain the dignity women and transgender people rightly deserve. But it’s never a good idea to dismiss scientific nuances in the name of a compelling argument or an honorable cause. We must allow science to speak for itself.\n\n_Debra W.

Instead, most of them spent weekend whining about comedienne Michelle Wolf, who appeared at the annual White House Correspondents’ Association dinner.\n\nIs it any wonder the president’s hysterical shrieking about “fake news” resonates with his supporters?\n\nThe loudest voices in our free press are driven almost entirely by the pursuit of profit, not the truth. At the top of that list are the right-wing propagandists who get paid millions to exalt the grievances of their predominantly white, male audience — the folks who forged Trump’s base.\n\nBut it also includes the so-called “mainstream” media, who have acted as Trump’s loyal press agents from the moment he entered politics.\n\nMichelle Wolf roasted lots of folks during her remarks, which was her job. But the comment that offended the assembled media A-listers most was the one they knew to be most disturbingly true:\n\n  _\"You guys are obsessed with Trump. Did you used to date him? Because you pretend like you hate him, but I think you love him. I think what no one in this room wants to admit is that Trump has helped all of you. He couldn't sell steaks or vodka or water or college or ties or Eric, but he has helped you. He's helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV. You helped create this monster, and now you're profiting off of him.\"_\n\nAs much as journalists hate to admit it, our Fourth Estate has been in a tacit alliance with Trump all along.\n\nHeck, they created Trump. The incessant coverage of his rallies and rants — remember all those feeds of empty podiums? — was what granted him the appearance of legitimacy. Without this attention, Trump would have remained a fringe figure, a demagogue and conman desperate to fan racial resentment into audience share.\n\nDon’t believe me? Here’s how the chairman of CBS, Les Moonves, explained it in February of 2016, speaking at a media conference sponsored by Morgan Stanley:\n\n  _“It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS … Donald’s place in this election is a good thing. Man, who would have expected the ride we’re all having right now? … The money’s rolling in and this is fun. I’ve never seen anything like this, and this is going to be a very good year for us. Sorry. It’s a terrible thing to say. But, bring it on, Donald. Keep going.”_\n\n  Ultimately, Trump and his cabal will be held accountable only if we hold ourselves accountable.\n\nEvery reporter and pundit and politician who is wasting time defending or debunking Wolf’s routine — rather than focusing on the kleptocratic aims of this administration, or the simple fact that Flint, Michigan still doesn’t have drinking water — will be judged by history. Not just as peddlers of fake news, but as the failed guardians of democracy.\n\nThe president’s ardent enablers will never hold him accountable for his corruptions, because they elected a bully to make them feel safe, not an adult who would govern.\n\nTherefore, the rest of us need to recognize our own complicity in this cycle. If we continue to focus on offensive tweets and comedy routines, our profit-mad media outlets will continue to feed us fake news.\n\nUltimately, Trump and his cabal will be held accountable only if we hold ourselves accountable.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about the White House Correspondents' Association dinner?","answers":[{"answer":"Michelle Wolf roasted lots of folks during her remarks, which was her job.

She has also said there is a \"legal question\" about whether the president can deploy the troops here.\n\nHowever, it was unclear whether there really is legal backing to her claim. She is a Democratic mayor in a largely Democratic city, and she is popular among her constituents. When she says the troops should not be on Washington streets, she is expressing an opinion held by many of the people who live here.\n\nWashington is a federal city, though, and federal authorities have significant power in this town.\n\nFor that reason, she does not have much legal recourse.

Fetch me my horse! I’m going out hunting!\"\n\n\"Yes sire!\" \n\nLousy, ungrateful, stupid bastard. Squire? Fucking squire? Jesus man you know my name, I’m Perry, like I tell you every fucking day. And don’t even get me started on the hunting. Hunting? Why don’t you just describe it accurately and call it seating your fat ass on the back of that poor sop of a horse and forcing it to canter round your shitty little forest, while you giggle with glee at the delightful experience of bouncing up and down. And all the while you’re accompanied by a large band of trumpeters, making absolutely sure every single animal with a brain has enough time to hear this ludicrous ensemble of idiocy, pack up its family, maybe have a small bite to eat and move the fuck away. Quite frankly, anything stupid enough to be caught by this moronic party had it coming. If the hunting party didn’t get them, an angry 6 year old with a small stick would’ve done the next morning. \n\nBut I’ve side-tracked. The more important debate here is how the fuck this man managed to become a knight. I’d call him stupid but that would be an insult to uneducated peons everywhere. He is his own class of stupid, so far down the IQ scale he may have broken into previously unexplored realms of negative IQ. Oh, you think I’m being mean? Maybe a bit overdramatic? Oh no no no. Let me explain. This is the man who, when getting out of a double bed, rolled over the wrong way to the other side of the bed and, rather than realise his mistake and either rolling the other way to escape the bed, or continuing his roll to reach the other side, shouted desperately for help, for he had lost the floor and was surely doomed. This is the man who picked up a sword from the wrong end and failed to understand his mistake. This is the man who put a helmet on his foot and complained when he couldn’t walk properly. Please understand, my master is genuinely something else. I’ve yet to theorise how he became a knight. Oh yes, his father was a knight and that grants him an easy ride to the role, but I am amazed that, after discovering that his son had the intelligence of a melon, his dear father hadn’t pushed him to follow an alternative career path, something more appropriate to his level like, ooh I don’t know, an early grave. \n\nToo far? Perhaps. But you don’t have to serve under this infantile baboon. Every waking moment of my day is spent entertaining his every want and need, and oh boy does he have a lot of needs. Sometimes – and I wish I was joking – he struggles with wiping his own ass. Guess who gets that fantastic job? That’s right, Squire Perry, his faithful fucking assistant. Other highlights include: serving him his food; helping him eat his food; cleaning his food when he spills it on the floor, like the clumsy halfwit he is; cleaning his bed; cleaning his clothes; organising his equipment. Oh, and how could I forget, fetching his fucking horse when he wants to go on a fucking hunting expedition.\n\nI should go, he might cry if he doesn’t get his bloody horse soon.

It was conceived as “a document not a documentary”,[1] and the performance was shot in New York City in December 1996, in an abandoned used clothing store on 14th street.[2] Over the course of the performance, simple props and set pieces are varied, such as a bare lightbulb and a tomato sculpture, and occasionally a passerby on the street glances in.[3]\n\nJonathan Demme met Hitchcock after Demme attended a live show, and offered to direct a live performance video for a song, which was then revised to be a full concert.[4] Demme was inspired to film in the storefront setting by a Hungarian theatre group, Squat Theatre, who operated in New York City in the 70s and 80s and typically performed in a storefront against a large plate glass window facing the street.[5]\n\nDemme subsequently cast Hitchcock in small roles in two other films, _The Manchurian Candidate_ and _Rachel Getting Married_, and used one of his songs in _The Truth About Charlie_.[6]\n\n\nSetlist\n\nAll songs composed by Robyn Hitchcock.\n\n1.  “Devil's Radio”\n2.  “1974”\n3.  “Filthy Bird”\n4.  “Let's Go Thundering”\n5.  “I'm Only You”\n6.  “Glass Hotel”\n7.  “I Something You”\n8.  “The Yip!

And inside Orion's stomach was wriggling Storefront Hitchcock, a little kind of minuscule million-dollar project that MGM wasn't particularly interested in.”[9] In fact in its original US release it only played in one theater in New York City, Film Forum, for one week starting in November 18, 1998.[10]\n\nThe film was released on DVD in 2000 by MGM.\n\n\nReception\n\nDennis Harvey in _Variety_ said that Hitchcock's “rich, supple voice shines, and his seemingly impromptu between-song patter suggests a pleasing form of mild insanity” also saying that “the songs are the real attraction here, and they provide a good overview of a large personal catalog.”[11] Stephen Holden in The New York Times wrote that the film “captures the sensibility of this smart, quirky folk-rocker in the most appealing possible light”,[12] while Scott Tobias in The A.V. Club wrote that “Demme's relaxed, ego-free direction is a reminder that the quirky humanist behind Melvin And Howard and Married To The Mob hasn't lost his touch”, and “his clean, elegant compositions enhance the intimacy of the performance”.[13] However Douglas Wolk of the Village Voice described it as a “simple but nicely presented document of a middling Hitchcock solo performance”, complaining that “the set list dips generously into his lamest recent material”.[14]\n\n\nSoundtrack\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n","title":"Storefront Hitchcock"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize everything relating to Jonathan Demme's filmography.","answers":[{"answer":"Demme traditionally makes documentary, not concert, videos.

The people there built mostly white buildings made of sharp straight angles to long thin points up into the sky.  The rest of the land was fairly flat which made it look like a pin cushion from a distance.  But when it was night the multicolored lights would make the city glow a beautiful kaleidoscope of colors.  This also was a pleasant help to sailors as they came into the city.\nA beast who used to be a man walked into the city.  He was larger than any man and barrel chested.  His skin was orange and he had an under-bite and two wide-but short horns growing from the front of his forehead.  His beard was long but missing the hair on top of his head.\n\nThe brute wandered into the city and the townsfolk of humans, spirits, and gnomes all strayed away from him.  He walked straight to the local tavern and sat an empty seat at the dice game currently in progress.  “You buying in big fella?” Asked an older man in a robe currently shaking some dice in his hand.  The brute said nothing and just sat staring at him.\n\n“Okay……” the old man dropped the dice into a bowl and everyone watched the dice spin waiting to see if the man had won or lost.  The old man could feel the brute staring at him still but kept his eyes on the dice.\n\nSuddenly the brute smashed the dice table with one of his hands and grabbed the old man up by the front of his robe and slammed him against the opposite wall.  “Remember me?” the brute growled.  Pulling his face closer to the old man and displaying his sharp teeth.\n\nThe other players at the table were enraged and went to draw their swords onto the brute but he simply backhanded them and knocked them through the tables behind them.  Then he punched the wall next to the old man’s head creating a fist sized hole in the wall.\n\n“I swear I think you have the wrong person!”  The old man said.\n\n“You made me like this!”  The brute said and threw him back into the other men right as they were getting up.  He stomped towards them all when a man from the corner stabbed him in side.  The brute just stared at him and squashed his head with one of his hands.  Then the pulled the sword out and bite into the blade shattering it.  His wound began to emit a black smoke but then his wound slowly sealed up.\n\nSoon the town guards came in and rushed to attack him.  He caught their glaives in his hands and shattered those blades too.  Stunned the guards stood in shock until the brute ran up and dove into them feet first sending them hurtling outside to smash into a wall and shattering a few of their bones.  When he got up he turned to see the old man running out the back door.\n\nThe brute charged after him.  In his pursuit he killed one of the gamblers when his huge foot crushed him in his path.  He leapt through the wall and landed close enough to the old man to grab him by the leg and hold him upside down in front of his face. \n\n“Okay I’m sorry okay!  I did not know it would be permanent!  I didn’t mean to do it!”  The old man pleaded.\n\nHe had convinced the brute to try some magical pixie powder he had bought from a traveling mage.  The old man did not want to try it on himself so he convinced a local teenager in the village he was at from across the western villages.  It had transformed that boy into an ogre like creature and wiped his mind of his memories.  At the time he slinked away hoping the brute would never remember what he had did and moved to this village to start a new life.\n\n“Cure me!!!” the brute roared!  “Give me my life back!!”  His thunderous voice echoed into the alleyways.  The rest of the towns guards had surrounded him and the old man during the shouting.  The old man hung there covering his face and trembling.\n\n“I can’t!  I can’t!  I’m not a mage!  I was told it would give me power but I didn’t know how to use it!  I’m sorry!!  I’m sorry!!”\n\nThe brute’s anger disappeared from his face and he closed his eyes and looked down at the ground.\n\nThen he swung the old man hard into the ground smashing his face like a watermelon onto the street.  They turned in disgust giving the brute enough time to swing the old man one more time into the guards and clearing a path for him to escape.  He leapt past them and jumped onto a large brick platform that had been resting outside of the town.   It began to rise into the air and once it had gotten off the ground it began to fly away off into the starry night between the desert pyramids.\n\nA figure in the corner sat cross legged with its back towards the brute.  “I told you it was a waste of time.  Once I found out your past I could tell he was just a fool.”\n\n“I know…. But I lost everything and once you gave me back my memories it broke my heart in ways you could never imagine.  I’m no longer Dash the man or Gorrak the damned.  Now I am someone else entirely and I wanted just one more chance to be the person I was originally supposed to be.  Now I have nothing.”\n\n“Then we will call you something different.  Perhaps Korrash is fitting?  Regardless I gave you back your memories and helped you find the man who did this to you.  Are you ready to pledge yourself to me?”  The creature slowly got up and turned around.  Its head and face was wrinkled beyond human capacity.  Like a naked mole rate.  When it flipped up its hood all you could see were two small white pupiless eyes and a tiny mouth with big fish like lips.\n\n“I do.  I pledge my servitude to you Mordid”.  Korrash said as he slumped down to sit down on the floor.  He had lost his past and his future.  All he had now was the present and his promise to Mordid.\n\nThey rode in silence atop the levitating brick platform in silence.  The cool wind was refreshing as they passed under the starts in the black night sky.  Mordid thought back pleasantly to day he had sold that transformative powder to that poor old man.\n","title":"[FN] The lost life"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the brute mean when he says he \"was just trying to get [back to being] the man he was supposed to be\"?","answers":[{"answer":"It may be implied that the brute means that he had everything he ever needed, including power and vitality, when he was human and not an ogre, but then he changed; altering his life always for the worse and having to convince himself he is becoming accustomed to his new life and pushing aside memories of the past that are painful and indicate loss.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer is made up.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer is too long and does not answer the question.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null],"is_critiqueable":true,"has_better_critique":true,"new_critique":{"text":"The answer given is inaccurate.

It was strategically planted within a few miles of Disney property in the hope we'd see our share of the tourist economy. \n\nThat's where I work as a customer service supervisor. \n\nIt's a very transient place. The tourists, our team members, upper management, everyone is always arriving or departing. We have a permenent Uber lane. There are little grab and go shampoos and shaving creams at every register. A whole section of our store is dedicated to hotel-related items. We even sell sandwiches in adorable, airplane shaped boxes. Every customer you meet is heading home soon and all the employees will tell you they're \"forming an exit plan\". You'll work with a guy for 6 months and one day he's vanished. The next thing you hear is a Facebook notification - \"Loading up the car for Portland, wish me luck Orlando!\" \n\nAs a result it can be easy to stop concerning yourself with the everyday details of those around you, even co-workers you see ten or twenty times a day. No one sticks around here. \n\nCase in point, this Asian chick whose been working behind the Juice Bar for somewhere between 4 months to a year, I can never tell. It just so happens most of my day is spent in a customer service booth directly across from this Bar. At that distance, maybe 50 feet, we'd exchange simple gestures - a glance here or nod there. I can tell you very little about her. She's maybe 5'3 with Dark Brown, chin length hair pinned up into a crayola orange beanie and covered neck to knees in an over-sized, white chefs coat. That's about it. One of the few other things I'd noticed was a handwritten name tag reading, \"Bok Choy\" in black permenent marker. \n\nI'll mention that this isn't so strange a thing to see on a name tag at Whole Foods Market. We have a store manager whom we regard as \"Juice\" because he's a 6'9 hipster with a bright orange Slayer beard. On any given day his name tag might say \"Juice\", \"The Juice\" or \"Juiced\". There's also a few hippies from the holistic team who renamed themselves after their astrological sign. A person's name tag can say literally anything here. \n\nThis day I decided to order a Juice, which is unusual for me. Approaching the register, I say, a bit loudly, \"Hey, Bok Choy, what's up?\". \n\nA cold stare came back in my direction. \n\n\"My name is Melanie. Seriously, Jason? I'm wearing a name tag and everything.\" \n\nI put a stupid look on my face and pointed at her chest. As I'm dropping my finger arrogantly towards the tag it finally hits me - the tag says \"Favorite Vegetable\". Not name, but \"Favorite Vegetable\". The real one, it turns out, was attached to her beanie. \n\nInstead of stopping here, as would be prudent, I did as I often do and talked myself into a worse place. \n\n\"But you can see where that's confusing for me, right Melanie? I'm over there, you're over here. That's a name tag from 50 feet away. I have basically no vantage point on your beanie. Your head is obstructed by the wheatgrass grinder.\" \n\nNow she starts laying on the sarcasm. \n\n\"But it says Bok Choy AND Favorite Vegetable, dude.\" The font is nearly the same size on both.\"\n\n\"But it's a name tag in the spot where normal people pin name tags! I'm not responsible for checking whether it, just this once, also says Favorite Vegetable.\"\n\n\"It's green\", she says. \"The name tag is green and has a little cauliflower head sticking out of the top of it. Did you also not notice those two things?\" \n\n\"I was thinking the Produce team just got cool, custom ones. Listen, people get nick names around here, ya know?\" \n\n\"And so you thought they nicknamed the new Asian girl Bok Choy and put it on her name tag?\" \n\nI ordered my juice.

Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) said that the complaint indicates that the cover-up is aimed at concealing the knowing criminal behavior of the administration. \n\n\"The whistleblower complaint has exposed a criminal effort to extort political dirty work from a foreign government, and a massive cover-up orchestrated by the White House,\" said Castro.\n\nThe complaint (pdf) alleges that, after the call, White House officials moved to put a word-for-word transcript of the conversation into a server separate from the normal one reserved for such matters. \n\n\"In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced—as is customary—by the White House situation room,\" the whistleblower writes in the complaint. \n\nParticularly, the complaint claims, intervention came from the administration's legal counsel. \n\n\"The public deserves to have full transparency regarding Trump's abuse of office.\"\n—Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\n\"White House officials told me they were 'directed' by White House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored for coordination, finalization and distribution to Cabinet-level officials,\" says the whistleblower. \n\nSpecifically implicated in the complaint are the president's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr.\n\nSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\n\nNever Miss a Beat.\n\nGET OUR BEST DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX.\n\n\"They knew the President had violated his oath of office,\" said Rep. Val Demings (D-Fl.). \n\nThe cover-up is \"as bad, if not worse, than Watergate,\" _Mother Jones_ writer Ari Berman said. \n\n\"Instead of hiring burglars to investigate political rival Trump asked a foreign government to do it for him and then tried to cover it up,\" said Berman.\n\n_New Yorker _writer Susan B. Glasser wrote Thursday that the phone call is part of a pattern of behavior:\n\n  The Ukraine scandal is, among many other things, a portrait of American foreign policy gone terribly wrong, hijacked by a President who has shredded the vast U.S. national-security apparatus in favor of a rogue operation looking out for his own interests and overseen by his personal agent, Rudy Giuliani. To anyone who has been paying attention, this has been the President’s approach to foreign policy from the start: it has been all Trump, all the time.\n\nTrump's pattern of behavior, and the current scandal being simply a part of it, was a point that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also made in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"This whistleblower complaint is only the tip of an iceberg of corrupt, illegal, and immoral behavior by this president,\" said Sanders. \"What the House must do is thoroughly investigate Trump's cover-up of this call and his other attempts to use government resources to help his re-election campaign. The public deserves to have full transparency regarding Trump's abuse of office.\"\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) said on Twitter that Congress must act as soon as possible to stop the president from continuing to use \"the Oval Office as his campaign office.\"\n\n\"We cannot let the occupant make a mockery of our Constitution any longer,\" said Omar. \"Congress must cancel the upcoming recess so we can finally impeach this president.\"\n\nOur work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License.

Home\n2.  News\n3.  Spaceflight\n\nSpaceX will attempt the first launch of its new giant rocket, the Falcon Heavy, on Feb. 6, the company's CEO Elon Musk said Saturday (Jan. 27).\n\nThe much-anticipated maiden flight of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket will lift off from the historic Launch Pad 39A — the same one used for NASA's Apollo moon missions and space shuttle flights — at the agency's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Musk's announcement came three days after SpaceX test-fired the Falcon Heavy's 27 first-stage engines for the first time at the launchpad on Wednesday (Jan. 24).\n\n\"Aiming for first flight of Falcon Heavy on Feb. 6 from Apollo launchpad 39A at Cape Kennedy,\" Musk wrote on Twitter. \"Easy viewing from the public causeway.\" [In Photos: SpaceX's 1st Falcon Heavy Rocket at the Pad]\n\nWhile Musk did not specify a launch time for the Falcon Heavy's first flight, the mission may lift off during a three-hour launch window that opens at 1:30 p.m. EST (1830 GMT), according to a SpaceNews report. A backup launch date is available the following day, SpaceNews added.\n\n[SpaceX's first Falcon Heavy rocket stands atop Launch Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket's debut launch is scheduled for Feb. 6, 2018.]\n\nSpaceX's first Falcon Heavy rocket stands atop Launch Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket's debut launch is scheduled for Feb. 6, 2018. (Image credit: SpaceX)\nSpaceX's Falcon Heavy booster is the most powerful rocket since NASA's Saturn V moon rocket. Its first stage consists of three Falcon 9 cores that are designed to return to Earth after launch much like the company's solo Falcon 9 flights.  \n\nThe heavy-lift rocket stands 230 feet tall (70 meters) and is designed to launch payloads of up to 119,000 lbs. (57 metric tons) into space. It can carry twice the load of its nearest rival: the Delta IV Heavy built by the United Launch Alliance.  \n\nFor its debut flight, the Falcon Heavy is carrying Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster into space. Musk has said the launch, if successful, will deliver the Roadster into a heliocentric orbit that will eventually send the midnight-cherry-red electric car by Mars.\n\nHowever, Musk has repeatedly attempted to lower expectations for the Falcon Heavy's first flight, saying there is a fair chance the launch could fail.\n\n\"There's a lot that could go wrong there,\" Musk said last year. \"I encourage people to come down to the Cape to see the first Falcon Heavy mission; it's guaranteed to be exciting.\"\n\nAnd Musk isn't alone in promising excitement. The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex (KSCVC), which offers tickets to view launches from Florida's Space Coast, unveiled a series of Falcon Heavy launch viewing packages on Thursday (Jan. 25).\n\nThose launch viewing packages range in price from $35 per person (for simple viewing access and parking) to the already-sold-out $195 per person \"Feel the Heat\" package, which offers two-day admission to the KSC Visitor Complex, transportation to a viewing area at the complex's Apollo/Saturn V Center, a trip to the Shuttle Landing Facility, a catered meal, SpaceX hat and other amenities.\n\n\"When SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy lifts off from Kennedy Space Center's famed Pad 39A, the same launchpad from which Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong set course for the moon on Apollo 11 in 1969, a new kind of history will be made,\" KSCVC representatives said in the announcement.\n\nSpaceX's Falcon Heavy test flight will come one week after the company's next mission. That flight will launch a Falcon 9 rocket carrying the GovSat-1 communications satellite from Space Launch Complex-40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. \n\n_Email Tariq Malik at tmalik@space.com or follow him_ _@tariqjmalik_ _and_ _Google+.__ Follow us_ _@Spacedotcom__,_ _Facebook__ and_ _Google+__.

He had a look of anticipation, as if he was waiting for some pain relieving gossip. \n\n“I was home,” I responded innocently before he rolled his eyes at me. “Now, don’t bother me, I’m trying to focus.” Although normally I would use anything to distract me from school, I wasn’t about to involve Max in last night’s mess.\n\n“Are you expecting me to believe you weren’t at Nina’s party?” He raised his eyebrows at me. I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me. Perhaps I couldn’t fix her parent’s divorce, but I could at least attend her house party. Especially after her break up with Todd, the leather jacket douche that called her “babe” so much I would wonder if he knew her real name.\n\n“I promise you’ll have a great time,” Nina had told me. And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle. Something nostalgic about repetitive rap songs preaching about the wonders of big asses. \n\nEverything seemed normal at first. The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room. I could feel the air thickening. \n\nMinutes before terror, I was standing unnoticed next to a group of girls I recognized. \n\n“Someone told me her dad was abusive,” I heard one say with wide eyes. \n\n“Yeah, apparently the neighbors called the cops on them,” another responded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t point fingers just yet. Nina’s mom’s a bitch. Maybe she deserved it,” a brunette shrugged and took a sip of her drink right before our eyes met. Her face flared red as she realized her words had been overhead. I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry. A millisecond later, I spotted Nina on the floor. Hands covering her face in defense. The lack of light in the room didn’t stop the fierceness of her blood as it dripped down her temple and into her hair. \n\nI stood still. My brain called in fear but my body made no response. Not even when Todd walked passed me, into the hallway and shut the door behind him. \n\nNina remained on the floor. She held herself and rocked back and forth, letting silent cries out into the thick air. \n\n“Don’t tell anyone.” She whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” Max snapped at me. “Are you going to tell me or not?” I stared at him blankly as the vivid flashbacks flew through my head.

Home\n2.  News\n3.  Spaceflight\n\nSpaceX will attempt the first launch of its new giant rocket, the Falcon Heavy, on Feb. 6, the company's CEO Elon Musk said Saturday (Jan. 27).\n\nThe much-anticipated maiden flight of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket will lift off from the historic Launch Pad 39A — the same one used for NASA's Apollo moon missions and space shuttle flights — at the agency's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Musk's announcement came three days after SpaceX test-fired the Falcon Heavy's 27 first-stage engines for the first time at the launchpad on Wednesday (Jan. 24).\n\n\"Aiming for first flight of Falcon Heavy on Feb. 6 from Apollo launchpad 39A at Cape Kennedy,\" Musk wrote on Twitter. \"Easy viewing from the public causeway.\" [In Photos: SpaceX's 1st Falcon Heavy Rocket at the Pad]\n\nWhile Musk did not specify a launch time for the Falcon Heavy's first flight, the mission may lift off during a three-hour launch window that opens at 1:30 p.m. EST (1830 GMT), according to a SpaceNews report. A backup launch date is available the following day, SpaceNews added.\n\n[SpaceX's first Falcon Heavy rocket stands atop Launch Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket's debut launch is scheduled for Feb. 6, 2018.]\n\nSpaceX's first Falcon Heavy rocket stands atop Launch Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket's debut launch is scheduled for Feb. 6, 2018. (Image credit: SpaceX)\nSpaceX's Falcon Heavy booster is the most powerful rocket since NASA's Saturn V moon rocket. Its first stage consists of three Falcon 9 cores that are designed to return to Earth after launch much like the company's solo Falcon 9 flights.  \n\nThe heavy-lift rocket stands 230 feet tall (70 meters) and is designed to launch payloads of up to 119,000 lbs. (57 metric tons) into space. It can carry twice the load of its nearest rival: the Delta IV Heavy built by the United Launch Alliance.  \n\nFor its debut flight, the Falcon Heavy is carrying Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster into space. Musk has said the launch, if successful, will deliver the Roadster into a heliocentric orbit that will eventually send the midnight-cherry-red electric car by Mars.\n\nHowever, Musk has repeatedly attempted to lower expectations for the Falcon Heavy's first flight, saying there is a fair chance the launch could fail.\n\n\"There's a lot that could go wrong there,\" Musk said last year. \"I encourage people to come down to the Cape to see the first Falcon Heavy mission; it's guaranteed to be exciting.\"\n\nAnd Musk isn't alone in promising excitement. The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex (KSCVC), which offers tickets to view launches from Florida's Space Coast, unveiled a series of Falcon Heavy launch viewing packages on Thursday (Jan. 25).\n\nThose launch viewing packages range in price from $35 per person (for simple viewing access and parking) to the already-sold-out $195 per person \"Feel the Heat\" package, which offers two-day admission to the KSC Visitor Complex, transportation to a viewing area at the complex's Apollo/Saturn V Center, a trip to the Shuttle Landing Facility, a catered meal, SpaceX hat and other amenities.\n\n\"When SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy lifts off from Kennedy Space Center's famed Pad 39A, the same launchpad from which Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong set course for the moon on Apollo 11 in 1969, a new kind of history will be made,\" KSCVC representatives said in the announcement.\n\nSpaceX's Falcon Heavy test flight will come one week after the company's next mission. That flight will launch a Falcon 9 rocket carrying the GovSat-1 communications satellite from Space Launch Complex-40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. \n\n_Email Tariq Malik at tmalik@space.com or follow him_ _@tariqjmalik_ _and_ _Google+.__ Follow us_ _@Spacedotcom__,_ _Facebook__ and_ _Google+__.

Here are 6 ways you can help make the difference between life and death for wildlife during increasingly hot and dry Aussie summers:\n\n[Leave water out.]\n\nSweltering summer days can be uncomfortable to be outside in for just a few minutes. Imagine what it is like for animals who have no way of escaping the heat. During heat waves, native animals can suffer terribly and even die — but the simple act of providing them save access to water can help them cope.\n\n-   Leave SHALLOW DISHES OF WATER in the shade (try to avoid metal dishes unless they're in full shade as they will get very hot in the sun)\n-   If you can put some dishes high up/in trees this will help keep wildlife safe from predators. \n-   Shallow bowls are best, as small birds can become trapped in deep dishes and drown (cat litter trays can actually be quite handy for this reason, and these are often found in discount stores for just a few dollars)\n-   If you only have large bowls or buckets — be sure to place some large twigs or rocks/bricks inside to allow any trapped animals to make their way out.\n\n[Keep dogs and cats indoors.]\n\nNot only will this help your animal companions escape the heat, but it will ENABLE THIRSTY WILDLIFE TO ACCESS WATER IN YOUR BACKYARD safely.\n\n[Cover your pool.]\n\nIt may feel counter-intuitive to prevent wildlife from cooling down in your pool on a hot day. But heat-stressed animals looking to cool down are at risk of drowning in pools so taking away that access can actually save lives (it's also not ideal for animals to be drinking pool water as they can get sick). Ensure animals have access to safe and fresh water sources in your back yard instead. \n\n[Keep an eye out for heat-stressed wildlife.]\n\nIf you spot any critters who look like they're struggling, call your local vet as well as local wildlife group for help. Particularly during natural disasters (eg. bushfires), wildlife carers can be overwhelmed — so it's worth contacting your vet who can assess the situation and treat injured animals (for free).\n\n-   Be particularly mindful at dusk and at night as many nocturnal animals will be more active during this time. \n-   PREPARE AN EMERGENCY KIT to keep in your car including water, a blanket/towel, and a box\n-   Save a few local wildlife rescue contacts in your phone so that you can ring for advice if you need it. \n-   Here are some measures you can take to help reduce the chances of animals being hit on the road.\n\n[Share your fruit trees with hungry wildlife]\n\nAfter extreme heat events and bushfires, Australias's flying foxes are in desperate need of help. Pictured is a flying fox who came into emergency vets after bushfires ravaged his home. Having survived the terrible fires, and with so many of his normal food sources gone, he was hungry and searching for food. This is what happened.\n\nWildlife who have survived through Australia's bushfire crisis are hungry. They have not only lost their homes, but their sources of food. And during this time of ecosystem devastation and habitat loss, it's never been more crucial to protect species like flying foxes — BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO POLLINATE TREES. The more flying foxes we can keep healthy and happy, the better our ecosystems will survive and regenerate. So please, take down your tree netting, and share some love for wildlife by sharing your fruit trees\n\n_Help spread this important message across Facebook and Twitter._\n\nIMPORTANT: If you come across an injured or heat-stressed flying fox (fruit bat) DO NOT TOUCH the animal. This is for the animal's own safety. Instead, immediately call a wildlife carer for advice.\n\n[Know what to do if you find distressed or injured wildlife]\n\nIf you have found an animal who is visibly distressed, wrap them loosely in a blanket or towel IF IT IS SAFE TO DO SO* and place them in a cardboard box, before placing the box in a dark, quiet, and cool place.\n\n_*Note that injured animals will often be quite frightened, so if you feel worried they may scratch or bite try gently ushering them into a washing basket without touching them instead of wrapping them in a blanket or towel._\n\nOffer water but not food and call a wildlife carer immediately, or your local vet. NEVER POUR WATER INTO AN ANIMALS' MOUTH — this is not natural and can cause additional distress and even physical harm. Instead, provide cool water in a bowl and allow them to lap from it.\n\nDO NOT WRAP HEAT STRESSED ANIMALS IN WET TOWELS OR SUBMERSE IN WATER — this can kill them.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you come across an injured or heat-stressed flying fox (fruit bat) DO NOT TOUCH the animal. This is for the animal's own safety. Instead, immediately call a wildlife carer for advice.\n\nWhat does a heat-stressed animal look like?\n\nSome of the signs that a native animal is heat-stressed include:\n\n-   Nocturnal (active at night) animals, such as possums, out during the day\n-   Tree-dwelling animals such as koalas, on the ground\n-   Birds or animals displaying any loss of balance, collapse, confusion or panting\n-   If you come across a wild animal being docile — ie. if you can approach them and they don't run away — this is a good sign that they are not well and need urgent care.\n\n[shadow]\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize some of the hardships Australian animals face during summers there.

A software fix for the 737 Max that Boeing has been working on since a fatal crash last October in Indonesia will take months to complete, Elwell told reporters.\n\nThe single-aisle 737 is central to Boeing’s future in its battle with European rival Airbus SE. The new variant of the 737, the fastest-selling jetliner in Boeing’s history, is viewed as the likely workhorse for global airlines for decades.\n\n“The agency made this decision as a result of the data gathering process and new evidence collected at the site and analyzed today,” the FAA said, shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the planes would be grounded.\n\nGRAPHIC - Ethiopian airlines crash speed and altitude data: tmsnrt.rs/2UAj5tW\n\nIt was the second time the FAA has halted flights of a Boeing plane in six years. It grounded the 787 Dreamliner in 2013 because of problems with smoking batteries.\n\nBoeing, which maintained that its planes were safe to fly, said in a statement that it supported the latest FAA move.\n\n“Boeing has determined - out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public of the aircraft’s safety - to recommend to the FAA the temporary suspension of operations of the entire global fleet of 371 737 MAX aircraft.”\n\nThe crash involving a Boeing 737 MAX in Indonesia killed 189 people. Passengers have been spooked by the two disasters. U.S. travel website Kayak was making changes to let customers exclude specific aircraft types from searches, and booking sites were looking to reroute passengers.\n\nGRAPHIC - Ethiopian Airlines crash plane and black boxes: tmsnrt.rs/2ChjLNE\n\n\nRE-BOOKING PASSENGERS\n\nU.S. airlines that operate the 737 MAX, Southwest Airlines Co, American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines, said they were working to re-book passengers. Southwest had 5 MAX-related cancellations on Wednesday and American nearly 40.\n\nSouthwest is the world’s largest operator of the 737 MAX 8 with 34 jets.\n\nFrance’s air accident investigation agency BEA will analyze black-box cockpit voice and data recorders from the crashed plane, a spokesman said.\n\nThe French announcement resolved uncertainty over the fate of the two recorders after Germany’s BFU said it had declined a request to handle them because it could not process the new type of recorder used on the 737 MAX jets, in service since 2017.\n\nShares of the company ended up 0.5 percent at $377.14, recovering from a more than 3 percent fall in the afternoon when the FAA announcement was made.\n\nThe United States had held back on suspending 737 MAX flights on Tuesday even as many of the world’s top economies such as China and European nations grounded the plane.\n\nTrump called Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg on Wednesday to inform him that the United States was preparing to ground the fleet, a White House official said.\n\n“I spoke with a number of airlines. And speaking to the airlines, I think that we all agree that this was right decision to make. It didn’t have to be made, but we thought it was the right decision to make,” Trump told reporters.\n\nThe grounding was welcomed by air workers in the United States. John Samuelsen, international president of the Transport Workers Union of America, which represents aviation workers and flight attendants, said the grounding of the fleet was right “both for air travelers and aviation workers.”\n\nGRAPHIC - Boeing shares hit after Ethiopia jet crash: tmsnrt.rs/2Ca96E7\n\n\nNEW SATELLITE DATA\n\nCanada also grounded 737 MAX jets on Wednesday, saying satellite data suggested similarities to the previous crash involving the same plane model in October.\n\nU.S.-based aircraft-tracking firm Aireon provided the satellite data to the FAA, Transport Canada and several other authorities, company spokeswoman Jessie Hillenbrand said.\n\nEthiopian Airlines spokesman Asrat Begashaw said it was still unclear what happened on Sunday, but its pilot had reported control issues as opposed to external factors such as birds.\n\n“The pilot reported flight control problems and requested to turn back. In fact he was allowed to turn back,” he said.\n\nBrazil, Mexico and Panama on Wednesday became the first Latin American nations to suspend the Boeing 737 MAX. Earlier, Panama’s Copa Airlines had suspended operations of its six Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft until the findings are published of an investigation into Sunday’s crash.\n\nThe chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Democrat Peter DeFazio, called for a probe into why the 737 MAX received certification to fly.\n\nGRAPHIC - Boeing 737 MAX aircraft by country: tmsnrt.rs/2NWeU90\n\nReporting by David Shepardson in Washington, Kumerra Gemechu in Gora-Bokka, Ethiopia, David Ljunggren in Ottawa; Additional reporting by Duncan Miriri and Aaron Maasho in Addis Ababa; Doina Chiacu in Washington, Omar Mohammed and Maggie Fick in Nairobi; Tim Hepher in Paris; Jamie Freed in Singapore; Terje Solsvik in Oslo; Aditi Shah in Mumbai; Sanjana Shivdas in Bengaluru; Aleksandar Vasovic in Belgrade; Julie Gordon in Ottawa; Angela Moon in New York, Eric Johnson in Seattle and Tracy Rucinski in Chicago; Writing by Bill Rigby and Alistair Bell; Editing by Gareth Jones, Nick Zieminski and Grant McCool\n\nfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize everything related to the president.","answers":[{"answer":"The FAA grounded the planes based on new satellite data and evidence from the scene of the crash.

I felt perfectly comfortable remaining silent and marching along as long as I knew she was with me. We had reached past the point of us needing speech to get our emotions across. We continued strolling for a while and then finally sat on a bench which was perched under an arched outgrowth of a stony structure. She put Her head on my lap and closed Her eyes. My love grew for Her every second I watched Her beautiful face in deep sleep. I wondered whether she felt the same way, or whether she felt at all. Suddenly, I sensed the earth moving. The whole world around me was shaking. I realised I didn't have much time left. I was about to depart. Slowly, the waterfall, flowers, the lake, butterflies, and the mountains faded away into darkness and then a bright light met my eye. The brightness diminished and I was back in my room. My servant was standing in front of me. \"Sir, why are you so hard to wake up these days? If you carry on going late to work, you will eventually be fired. You don't want that do you?\" he said. If only he knew.  \n\n \n\nI was both happy and sad. I felt sad leaving Her, but I was happy that it had now worked three times in a row. How lucky was I, that having slept a sad sleep the day before yesterday, I would meet Her the second time. This ignited in me the thought of the possibility that I could meet Her whenever I wanted to. So I tried to meet Her the third time today. I was doubtful and skeptical. I am a middle aged man who has never experienced love. Forget the act of loving, I couldn't even think of the prospect of finding love in my lifetime. I turned off all the lights, locked the door, threw myself on the bed and closed my eyes.\nI was failing. I was sweating uncontrollably with nervousness. This was my last chance to find what I never had. Then, I thought of Her, with Her soft and beautiful face, Her enigmatic eyes, Her endless &gt; locks of hair, Her slender yet graceful body, the vulnerability in Her glances, Her voice that confirmed the presence of angelic minstrels. God himself had sent down this perfect entity for me to spend time with, albeit in a second reality. I had to calm down and sleep. I was no longer panting, and was able to slowly drift away into slumber.    \n\n \n\nI was in a vast empty ball room. It was beautiful, but right now, I had no concern for the beauty of inanimate objects. I had to find Her as quickly as I could, so I could maximise the amount of time I was to spend with Her. I looked for Her everywhere. Where was she? Was it really possible that I failed, even in bringing a being that lived inside my thoughts, to appear in front of me? I was suddenly struck by the memory of yesterday. I had stood in front of the mirror for an hour. I gazed at my disfigured body, my hunched back, my crooked teeth, my uneven face and my uninteresting eyes. I had decided to break every mirror in my house that day, for they were only a source of pain to me. Now, as I looked around for Her in the ballroom, I slowly became demoralised. I could not even find Her in a second reality. I wept and I wept, and for sure, I did know I was physically weeping too, for I felt the dampness seep through my body. 'Come here,' said an enchanting voice. 'Did you really think I was going to leave you alone?'  \n\n\n \nA white figure seemed to be approaching me. Her shape became more apparent as she moved towards me. She was dressed in the most elegant of elegant dresses. She came up to me, and without uttering a word, kissed me. All my doubts, inferiorities and insecurities vanished in a matter of seconds. 'You have me right now and you will have me forever,' she said. 'My appearance may change but I will always be Her.' We sat together on the velveted floor. I told Her everything I knew and everything I wanted to do. She listened patiently without any patronising judgement. She seemed as if she had been lost in my discourse. She comforted me when I told Her my doubts and answered me when I had queries. Seconds, minutes, hours and then days seemed to have passed by. We were still sat on the same spot talking and being lost in wonder of one another. 'I have to go fly,' she said with a hint of sycophancy, 'Try not to think about me.' She faded away gradually, and slowly, the whole room turned dim and finally, my whole vision was obscured. I woke up.  \n\n \n\nI opened my eyes and looked around. I wasn't in my room. There were people around me, maybe four or five. 'Sir, you have been in a coma for six years. My whole team and I would like to congratulate you on being born again. Also try to sleep less,' a doctor said, letting out a faint chuckle. I wasn't able to speak as I lay there helpless. I didn't care about anyone else other than Her. I wanted to go back and never come back. A memory came to my mind about when I met my childhood friend after not seeing him for a while.  \n\n\n\n'What brought you into acting then, James?' I asked.\n\n\n'My wife... the third one, she pushed me towards getting a job as an actor. She had faith in my ability. And so right she was, I had never even dreamed of achieving such fame.' James answered.\n'Good for you, my friend, if only I were a part of your gene pool.'\n\n\n'My gene pool? You think I've only gotten this far because of my looks?'\n\n\n'You never were intelligent were you? Only if you were, you could have acknowledged the luck that had been bestowed upon you. Nobody falls in love with character at first sight. Set on this earth is a bliss for the rich and beautiful.'  \n\n\n\n'You always were a jealous man. Stop envying other people's abilities and go back to your cave and hang out with your rodents, you incompatible oddity!'\n\nHe stormed out of the restaurant leaving me alone with my food and strangers' stares. He was right. I was an oddity.  \n\n\n\nI had regained consciousness and was out of my coma. I had been awake thinking about this incident while tears ran down my face. It was soon dark outside and I started feeling drowsy. I was about to sleep and it was the most joyous part of the day. I soon fell asleep but there were no dreams this day and I woke up without any recollection of Her. 'This wouldn't happen again,' I thought to myself. I slept the next day and again; no luck. The day after that, I entered a dream but she was nowhere to be seen. Did she lie when she said she would be with me forever? I was discharged from the hospital and returned to my room. Surely, this was where it all started so I will get to meet her when I sleep in my own dwelling. I slept. She had abandoned me. The only companion I had, had abandoned me. She was a part of me so I guess I had abandoned myself.  \n\n\n \n\n'There is more than one way a person can sleep.' I thought to myself. I started panting. I walked in circles for an hour in my room as my heartbeat became faster and faster. I had no family or acquaintances I could talk to. I started climbing the stairs sluggishly, that led to the highest storey of the high-rise. My pulse increasing with every step I took. I finally arrived at the top of the skyscraper. I stood at its edge, with my heart pounding the loudest and fastest it had ever pounded. I thought of Her one last time. 'I will surely meet you, and I would never know even if I don't. My real love has always been the sleep that rescued me by allowing me to dream.'  With these thoughts, I took the step to death. The only feeling I felt after that was the feeling of Nothing.\n","title":"Love Slumber"},"questions":[{"question":"Why does the narrator step off the building at the end of the story?","answers":[{"answer":"He has been dreaming of this woman in his dreams, and she has abandoned him.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention that the narrator is desperate to meet the woman.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"It is omitted that he is desperate to be with her.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[0,1],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":true,"new_critique":{"text":"The response should add that the man is alone in the world and sleep is his real love because it rescued him and allowed him to dream.","category":"coverage","severity":2,"category_text":""}},{"question":"Why does the narrator's friend accuse him of being jealous?","answers":[{"answer":"He sees that the narrator is jealous of his wife.","critiques":[{"critique":"The narrator's friend doesn't accuse him of jealousy, but rather of envy.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The friend isn't really the narrator's friend.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is incorrect.

(Fox News)\n\nParkland tragedy survivor Kyle Kashuv has emerged as a role model for young conservatives across the country -- and it was never more evident than this week, when he helped plan the largest-ever high school conservative conference.\n\nKashuv -- a staunch defender of the Second Amendment -- played a key role in the Turning Point USA High School Leadership Summit, which was held in Washington, D.C., and attracted more than 800 students from at least 40 states.\n\n“It’s great to see these kids here because these are the leaders in their high school campuses. These are the kids who are going to energize and motivate other kids to come out to vote and to volunteer and to push conservative values,” Kashuv told Fox News.\n\nKashuv – who will enter his senior year at Stoneman Douglas High School in the fall -- booked many of the speakers directly and played a role in everything from the attendees having dormitory accommodations to contacting media members so the event got coverage. He also served as the master of ceremonies, introducing nearly every speaker over a jammed-packed, four-day span at George Washington University.\n\n“Kyle is a total stud,” Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk told Fox News. “He’s a phenomenal person, driven and mature beyond his years. He works his ass off.”\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Sen. Orrin Hatch and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer all addressed the students. So did Donald Trump Jr. and a variety of media stars.\n\nDespite all the conservative star power, the attendees seemed to be as excited for Kashuv as they were for anyone.\n\n[Kyle Kashuv introduced nearly every speaker at the four-day Turning Point USA event.]\n\nKyle Kashuv introduced nearly every speaker at the four-day Turning Point USA event.\n\nAbigail Addi, a high school student from Queens, New York, traveled to the Washington, D.C., event because she is a supporter of Kashuv and his political views. She decided she couldn’t pass up the opportunity once Kashuv began promoting the event on social media.\n\n“I met him last night. I was shaking, it was surreal,” Addi told Fox News. “He’s definitely a role model for me, and I’m sure for many other young conservatives.”\n\nWhen Kashuv took the stage to answer a few questions from the audience on Wednesday, chants of “USA! USA! USA!” erupted. The crowd went into a frenzy anytime he appeared to hand out t-shirts, and teenagers shouted his name anytime he was spotted around campus. He received another enormous ovation when Kirk called him out on stage Thursday.\n\nWhile he was essentially treated as a rockstar among the summit’s attendees, Kashuv considers the students his friends.\n\n“I treat them like bros, like friends from school. I’m the exact same thing as them. I meme, I play Fortnite, I procrastinate to do my homework. I’m the exact same thing as them,” he said. “They can impact the world even more than I can.”\n\nSpeakers continuously praised Kashuv for organizing the event, but he returned the admiration by thanking the conservative leaders for simply giving him the time of day.\n\n“People disregard high school kids all the time, but they understand the importance of these kids as the next generation of leaders,” Kashuv said.\n\n[Kyle Kashuv was invited to the White House to meet with President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump.]\n\nKyle Kashuv was invited to the White House to meet with President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump.\n\nKashuv became nationally known following the Feb. 14, 2018 tragedy in Parkland, Fla. when 17 of his classmates were killed by a school shooter. While many survivors emerged as anti-gun advocates, Kashuv defended the Second Amendment at every turn.\n\n“As Americans we all have different point of views, and it’s important to represent them all equally,” Kashuv said on “Face the Nation” in March.\n\nKashuv first linked up with Turning Point when he was approached directly by the 24-year-old Kirk following the Parkland tragedy. The young conservatives hit if off immediately and Kashuv was offered a chance to help TPUSA on the spot.\n\n“He brought this to the next level. We had 150 kids last year, now we have well over 800,” Kirk said. “He deserves all the credit. It’s his thing and we’re proud to advertise it as such. Putting together these kinds of speakers is unbelievable.”\n\nStill not used to the spotlight, he looked to friends backstage for reassurance that he properly introduced speakers throughout the event. Kashuv even joked that he had to use his own money to purchase a suit for the event.\n\nLast April, Kashuv even escorted an adoring Nebraska high school student to her prom after she approached him on social media – but only after she collected the 5,000 retweets he required to be her date for the evening.\n\nKashuv was emerging as a conservative darling well before the successful event, meeting with President Trump and even discussing the Second Amendment with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas – but the TPUSA summit gave him a chance to mingle with his peers.\n\nBeing a hero of the right isn’t easy. Especially for a 16-year-old who opposes the majority of his classmates' calls for more restrictive gun laws. Kashuv said he has received death threats, is bullied at school, has been mistreated by teachers and receives endless criticism on social media – simply for coming out as a conservative.\n\n“I couldn’t care less. The reason why I’m doing what I am today is not because I wanted to. It is because there was a necessity for someone to do it,” he said.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the main news event.","answers":[{"answer":"Parkland tragedy survivor Kyle Kashuv has emerged as a role model for young conservatives across the country.

No, not on this night, with all their injuries and a lack of coverage talent in their secondary. (A quick side note on that: The Eagles will spend the next few days trying to pry Jalen Ramsey from the Jags, as they know their lack of coverage will prevent them from competing at the highest level. The Eagles typically win with their defensive front dominating the game, but with all the injuries to their defensive line, the lack of pressure has highlighted their lack of talent in the secondary.) But the Eagles were the better situational team, as they went 4-4 on their goal line visits and ultimately that was the difference in the game.\n\nHow the Eagles’ offense got their groove back - BGN\nDoug Pederson reeled in the passing game on Thursday, asking Wentz to work a shorter, quicker game with a heavy does of RPOs requiring high-speed decision-making. Wentz delivered by making the reads and getting the ball out quick, including a 2.41 time-to-throw per PFF. Pederson asked Wentz to let the offense work for him and that’s exactly what he did. If you can find a missed read by Wentz, please let me know because I sure couldn’t. It’s of note that Wentz’s time-to-throw (TTT) has been under 2.45 seconds on three out of his last four outings in 2019.\n\nAt the Podium: The Eagles’ Get Their Groove Back - BGN Radio\nJohn Stolnis talks about the Eagles’ big Week 4 win with their backs against the wall PLUS three new pressers, two from after the game with Doug Pederson & Carson Wentz, then another from Pederson on Friday after having a night to “sleep” on things..Powered by SB Nation and Bleeding Green Nation.\n\nDifference Maker - Iggles Blitz\nThe Eagles have one more weapon…Doug Pederson. Anyone who watched the Packers and Eagles on Thursday night could see the difference in coaching. Matt LaFleur is a rookie head coach and made several questionable decisions. He had 4th & 2 from the Eagles 13-yard line, with his team leading 10-7. The Packers had been moving up and down the field. LaFleur took a page straight from the Sean McVay playbook and kicked the FG. That gave the Packers a whopping 13-7 lead. Where is the aggression? Why wouldn’t you trust Aaron Rodgers to make a play there? If you fail, you’re still up 10-7. LaFleur made some questionable play-calls. The Packers had no run game. Aaron Jones had 13 carries for 21 yards. Person after person on Twitter was writing that every Jones run was a Christmas gift to the Eagles, who had no answers for WR Davante Adams and the Packers passing game.\n\nEagle Eye: How the rushing attack stymied the Packers’ vaunted defense - PE.com\nThe Eagles did creative things schematically. They ran more than a handful of different run concepts. They used misdirection, they used smash-mouth, and they got out to the perimeter. RPOs were successful. Screens were successful. Play-action was successful. The entire smattering worked, and when you get the kind of dominant performance that the team got from the offensive line in the trenches, that only will help propel you to victory. I thought the entire line performed well in this game, but if I had to pick one player who stood out most, it would be right guard Brandon Brooks, who got great movement time and time again up front. The Milwaukee native was a sixth captain for Thursday night’s game.\n\nNFL Week 4 PFF ReFocused: Philadelphia Eagles 34, Green Bay Packers 27 - PFF\nThe Eagles’ pass-rush was formidable in this game, recording pressure on what seemed like half of Aaron Rodgers’ dropbacks. As you’d expect, Fletcher Cox and Brandon Graham were at the forefront, feasting on a Green Bay line that struggled to block them from the get-go. There’s a strong chance that Graham comes away with a double-digit pressure total, and Cox won’t be far behind.\n\n  People are talking about possible pass interference on the Eagles pick at the end of the game on Thursday night. The contact was not more than a yard downfield. Not a foul even if reviewed. I would not have stopped it either.\n\n  — Mike Pereira (@MikePereira) September 28, 2019\n\nExamining the Eagles’ endless rash of cornerback injuries - NBCSP\nCornerback injuries decimated the Eagles last year. They started the season in Tampa with Jalen Mills and Ronald Darby as the starters and Avonte Maddox, Douglas and Sidney Jones as the backups and they finished it with Cre’Von LeBlanc, Douglas and Maddox as the starters and Josh Hawkins off the bench.

If one of the players who left the Steelers in free agency in the 2019 offseason were to be released before Week 10 of the NFL season, the Steelers might lose out altogether on a compensatory draft pick. Although the scenario seemed unlikely, it was put more to rest in August when it appeared that Le’Veon Bell, Jesse James, and L.J. Fort would all make their respective teams. Not anymore. On Friday, the Philadelphia Eagles released L.J. Fort, a move that will help them gain an extra compensatory pick while causing the Steelers to no longer enter into the formula.\n\n  The Ravens hosted recently-released Eagles LB L.J.

She shot basketballs in her driveway in the evening, and when her older sisters would return home with a date, she would challenge the dates to a hoop contest. Even though she was ten years old, she would challenge them in her pyjamas and usually beat them, picking up a little pocket change.[3] She started playing volleyball in eighth grade, when her pastor persuaded her to join a team.[4][5] She attended West Aurora High School, where she played both basketball and volleyball, but she improved her volleyball skills and was named a high school All-American. In her senior year, she helped lead the team to the state supersectionals.[6]\n\nWhile at high school, she played basketball and volleyball for her first three years, but then decided to concentrate on volleyball, and only played volleyball as a senior.[7] In her senior year, the was named the Chicago Sun-Times Girls Volleyball Players of the Year.[8] She considered several schools in the area, including Northwestern, Illinois State, Western Michigan and Illinois. However, while all three schools other than Illinois were ranked in the top 20 in the nation, she decided to go to Illinois.[9] It wasn't because of their strength as a program, the team was 15–18 the year before she arrived, and 5–25 the year before, but she felt Illinois was a “team on the rise” and she wanted to be part of it.[10][11]\n\n\nCollege\n\nEggers led the nation in hitting percentage in her sophomore and senior years, 1986, and 1988.

Andrew Cuomo received in the past six months easily topped the growing field of potential challengers this year.\n\nWho came in second place? Not Republican Brian Kolb ( who raised $16,026 for governor on top of $42,387 in his Assembly account), Democrat Terry Gipson ($6,092), or Republican Joel Giambra ($0). Republican John DeFrancisco raised $116,452 for a pair of state Senate committees, but has yet to declare whether he’ll seek statewide office.\n\nBy a wide margin, the declared candidate who received the second-highest contribution total was Larry Sharpe, who’s planning to run on the Libertarian line. He raised $102,596 during the filing period, most of which he said came from small donors who contributed online.\n\nIn a state in which voters are reluctant to embrace Republicans — Democrats have won the past 19 statewide races — Sharpe plans to present himself as a potential alternative to voters who don’t like Cuomo.\n\n“The Republican vote is a wasted vote,” he said. “There is no way a Republican can win in this state. The advantage that I have is I’m not a Republican, I’m a Libertarian. … So when New York state looks at the Republican and says, ‘Not that guy,’ and they look at Cuomo and say, ‘Not that guy’ — I’m their guy.”\n\nSharpe, a former trucking company executive and Marine, sought the national party’s nomination to be Gary Johnson’s running mate in the 2016 national election. He came close, losing with 47 percent of the vote on the second ballot at the party's convention to former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld (who once ran for governor in New York himself).\n\nHe’s already gained Johnson’s endorsement, and partially as a result of his efforts in 2016, Sharpe has a substantial online presence. A Facebook page for his gubernatorial campaign has 41,000 followers. Cuomo’s political page, by comparison, has 129,000, and neither of the two declared Republicans has many more than 3,000.\n\nMuch of that following and his fundraising likely comes from Libertarians from other states. But the magnitude of it, coupled with the fact that Sharpe already has started to campaign, makes it realistic to imagine a scenario in which he crosses the magic threshold of 50,000 votes.\n\nWhen a candidate hits that number in a gubernatorial election, a little more than 1 percent of the votes cast, the party becomes official in New York. For the next four years, the party has automatic ballot access, appears on voter registration forms and has the state fund its primaries.\n\nEight parties crossed that threshold in 2014. But outside of a 48,359-vote performance by Warren Redlich in 2010, Libertarians have never come particularly close.\n\nSharpe said it was \"a joke\" to talk about his chances of garnering at least 50,000 votes. “I already have a base of [176,000] people who vote for Gary Johnson and Bill Weld in 2016,\" he said. \"I’ll get that easily.”\n\nThird-party candidates have rarely been competitive in New York’s gubernatorial races. Paychex founder Tom Golisano drew between 4 and 14 percent of the vote in a trio of campaigns that began in 1994, but there have only been two elections since the Civil War in which a candidate not running on either the Democratic or Republican lines has come close to finishing in even second place.\n\nDespite this track record, Sharpe says he’s running not just to legitimize the party, but to win.\n\n“Only about 4 million New Yorkers are going to vote,” he said, suggesting that somebody might win election as governor without a majority in a three-way race. “So that means all I need is about 1.5 million and I’m governor. That’s a mountain, but that’s not impossible.”\n\nHe says there are four areas that will determine who is ultimately elected — traditional media coverage, public speaking, social media and debates. While he’s ready to concede coverage by traditional media, he thinks he can be competitive in the other three.\n\n“When it comes to speaking and events, it’s not his skill set, he’s not good at that,” Sharpe said of Cuomo.\n\nCuomo has had lackluster grass-roots support online in the past, and Sharpe is confident he’ll outshine the incumbent in this arena. “He is a dire soul when it comes to social media,\" he said, \"so I’ll beat him there for sure.”\n\nAnd he says he’ll handily beat the governor in any debates, asserting that Cuomo is \"not a very good debater.\"\n\nWhen asked what he would do if he wins, Sharpe said he would make entities like the Board of Regents and Metropolitan Transportation Authority be more accountable, putting them under the authority of specific offices that would have to answer for any problems.\n\nBefore he even gets on the ballot, however, he’ll have to win the Libertarian Party’s state convention in April, but doesn’t see this as a roadblock.\n\n“Assuming there’s no celebrity that jumps in and says, ‘I want to be on the ballot,’ the odds are very high I’ll be the nominee,” Sharpe said.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the main news event.","answers":[{"answer":"The main news event is Larry Sharpe's intention to run for New York governor on the Libertarian party.

Both sides are about the same, when he is away from the teleprompter and going off script. There is only so much filter that can be removed when there’s hardly any filter to start with. Still, it was somewhat shocking to see Trump talking openly Thursday about something he has so far kept private: imposing the death penalty for people caught dealing drugs. “Some countries have a very, very tough penalty—the ultimate penalty,” Trump said wistfully at a White House summit on the opioid crisis. “And, by the way, they have much less of a problem.”\n\nWe’ve seen this one coming: In April, Trump called President RODRIGO DUTERTE to praise his bloody crackdown on drugs in the Philippines, which has reportedly killed as many as 12,000 people. “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,” he said, referring to Duterte’s extrajudicial, state-sanctioned murder program. “Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that.” The idea apparently stuck with Trump: Last week, Axios reported that Trump has continued privately raising the possibility of executing drug dealers, as Singapore does. “He says that a lot,” one source recalled. “He says, ‘When I ask the prime minister of Singapore do they have a drug problem [the prime minister replies,] ‘No. Death penalty.’”\n\nSenior adviser KELLYANNE CONWAY essentially confirmed the report when she clarified that Trump was merely referring to bringing capital murder charges against high-volume dealers of drugs like fentanyl, which, she pointed out, “are so lethal in such small doses.” On Thursday, Trump brought the idea out into the open, suggesting that the United States adopt “the ultimate penalty” for drug dealers.\n\nThe president’s comments fit a pattern of authoritarian rhetoric, from calling Democrats “treasonous” for not applauding his State of the Union address to pressuring the Department of Justice to prosecute his political opponents. But they also suggest a looser, less controlled Trump as the president has grown increasingly frustrated with the shackles his chief of staff, JOHN KELLY, has imposed on him. The chains began to break last month, as Kelly’s authority was rocked by allegations of domestic abuse involving his second-in-command, ROB PORTER. The scandal created a domino effect in the White House that fueled tensions between Kelly and JARED KUSHNER over Kushner’s security clearance and was a factor in the resignation of HOPE HICKS, one of Trump’s closest confidants.\n\nThe silly season has, in turn, fed a bumper crop of crazy coming out of the Oval. Trump is reportedly considering firing National Security Adviser H.R. MCMASTER, whom he also resents, and on Thursday bucked the advice of his National Economic Adviser GARY COHN and announced tariffs on steel and aluminum, causing the stock markets to plunge. For months, Trump’s senior staff had slow-walked his enthusiasm for a trade war. This week, he decided he would act unilaterally. “Trade wars are good, and easy to win,” Trump tweeted Friday morning, as the Dow Jones dropped another 350 points.

Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV225-230). However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of _Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden_, BWV 230, one of the “six”.\n\nA single CD has the capacity to contain the set of six motets plus some other works. For example, Maasaki Suzuki's 2009 recording with the Bach Collegium Japan on BIS includes _O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht_, BWV 118 (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and _Ich lasse dich nicht_, BWV Anh. 159 (the authorship of which has been disputed).[1] The motets chosen for a particular recording project can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of particular work: given Bach's status as one of the great composers, a firm attribution to him is likely to result in more interest in recording the piece in question. For example, was not included by John Eliot Gardiner and the Monteverdi Choir in their first set recorded in 1980. However, they included it in their 2011 recording,[2] by which time scholarly opinion had re-assessed the work.\n\nRecordings have also been made of the less securely attributed and even spurious motets. For example, Wolfgang Helbich recorded _The Apocryphal Bach Motets_, sung by the Alsfelder Vokalensemble, in 1993 (released in 1994, re-issued 2014).[3][4]\n\n\nTypes of choirs\n\nChoirs with one voice per part (OVPP) are used in some historically informed performances of Bach. However, OVPP recordings of the motets are in the minority. Exceptions include the Hilliard Ensemble's second set,[5] and Konrad Junghänel with the group Cantus Cölln.[6] Philippe Herreweghe's second set uses OVPP for some motets, for example _Jesus meine Freude_, and not others.[7]\n\nAt least some of the motets would have been first performed by singers from Leipzig's Thomanerchor, which comprises boys and young men. This choir has recorded the motets (initially under Günther Ramin in the 1950s),[8] as have other choirs with boys' voices such as the Choir of New College, Oxford.[9]\n\n\nInstrumental accompaniment\n\nMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used. There are three possible approaches:\n\n-   _a cappella_, that is, without an accompaniment\n-   instruments doubling the vocal lines, something which is described as playing _colla parte_\n-   Basso continuo, or just an organ accompaniment, to provide some instrumental support for the singers\n\nSurviving sources do not make it clear what Bach's approach was to the accompaniment of most of these pieces. In the case of _Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf_, BWV 226 orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings and choir II by reeds (two oboes, taille and bassoon). There is also a basso continuo provided (separate violone and organ parts) which underlies both choirs.[10] An accompaniment is also specified for _Lobet den Herrn_.[11]\n\nLa Petite Bande and Bach Collegium Japan, for example, use the orchestration of _Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf_ for the other pieces for double choir. However, _a capella_ performance is long-established tradition,[12] which is also reflected in recordings. The Hilliard Ensemble's OVPP version is mainly _a capella_. They omit the instrumental parts of _Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf_, but sing _Lobet den Herrn_ to organ accompaniment.[13]\n\nThe recordings with continuo accompaniment include The Sixteen's version (the instruments are cello, violone, theorbo, organ) and the second recording by the Monteverdi Choir (cello, double bass, bassoon and organ).[14]\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe first of the motets to be recorded was _Jesu meine Freude_ in 1927. This version was sung in English.[15]\n\n\nAwards\n\nIn 2010, Suzuki and his ensemble were given a French award (Diapason d’Or de l’Année) and a German award (Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik) for their recording of Bach motets on BIS.\n\nJohn Eliot Gardiner, who has won more Gramophone Awards than any other living artist, received one for his second recording of the motets with the Monteverdi Choir on SDG. It was one of the 2013 awards, the category being “Baroque Vocal”.\n\nGrete Pedersen with the Norwegian choir Det Norske Solistkor won a Diapason d'Or in 2018 for their recording of the motets on BIS.\n\n\nDiscography\n\nThe intention has been to feature versions which are still available. The year given is that of recording. In the case of pre-1980s recordings, the date of reissue on CD can be significantly later than the original recording.\n\n\nNotes\n\n[1] \n\n[2] _Bach: Motets_ and _Bach Motets_ at .\n\n[3] _The Apocryphal Bach Motets: BWV Anh. 159–165_ at .\n\n[4] The Sacred Apocryphal Bach (8 CD set) at ArkivMusic website.\n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11]  Accessed via JSTOR (subscription required)\n\n[12] Emery, W.

The violations occurred while the presidential adviser was CEO of the company.\n\n Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nKushner Cos. has been hit with $210,000 in fines by New York City regulators for filing false real estate paperwork over several years.\n\nPresident Trump's son-in-law — and current adviser — Jared Kushner was still at the helm of the real estate company as CEO when, the New York City Department of Buildings says, the company routinely falsified construction applications at 17 sites.\n\nThe city's Building Department found the company frequently under-reported — and in some cases didn't report any — rent-regulated tenants living in its buildings, despite renting to hundreds of them.\n\nDevelopers are required to report the number of rent-controlled tenants they inherit when they buy properties and renovate them. The requirement is a safeguard to protect tenants from steep rental increases or from being driven out to make way for higher-paying tenants.\n\nOn Monday, the city fined the Kushner family business for 42 violations at 12 addresses between January 2013 and September 2016.\n\n\"Protecting tenants is a key part of our mission to make construction safe for all New Yorkers, and we are determined to hold landlords accountable for the accuracy of their applications – no matter who they are,\" the department said in a statement emailed to NPR.\n\nBut Christine Taylor, a spokeswoman for Kushner Cos., contradicted what the city's Building Department told NPR.\n\n\"No fines were assessed against the company today,\" Taylor said in an email to NPR.\n\nShe acknowledged that \"there were some violations issued for paperwork errors\" but said \"the company relied on third party consultants for the preparation of these forms and if in error they have been corrected or will be.\"\n\nDespite denying the fines, she says that Kushner Cos. plans to present \"the facts before an administrative law judge and until then no amount is due, if any.\"\n\nAlso under scrutiny is an investment group led by Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen. The New York Times reported that Cohen's business allegedly submitted false construction permits for three Manhattan properties. In each instance, according to a report by the Housing Rights Initiative, the Cohen group reported buildings \"were vacant or without rent-regulated tenants, when they were occupied and many of the tenants had rental protections.\"\n\nConcerning one building in the Lower East Side, the _Times_ reported:\n\n  \"At 172 Rivington Street, for example, the Cohen group indicated that there were no rent-regulated tenants in the 20-unit building, after the company purchased it in October 2011 for $2.1 million. But records indicated that there were 19 protected tenants there, but only 11 remained after the Cohen group sold the building three years later for $10 million.\"\n\nIn July, a group of current and former rent-stabilized tenants in one of the Kushner Cos.' Williamsburg, Brooklyn, developments, filed a lawsuitclaiming they were deliberately exposed to toxic smoke and other unsafe conditions.

Thunder rolled and boomed, as lightning lit up the skies. Below, the salty waves tossed and tumbled, growing larger as the wind whipped and raged from the north. The rain came down in torrents, pelting the deck of the wooden ship, and soaking the wood. The first mate barked out orders to the crew who busied themselves to carry those orders out. The sails were taken in, so as to not be blown off course. The idea was to wait out the storm, as the waves weren’t so bad that they needed to get out of danger. Near the bow, on top deck, a woman cloaked in a silver robe stood by a man who was robbed in royal purple. Both had crowns fastened to their heads. Soldiers stood by, on edge from the storm, but otherwise relaxed. The man smiled down at his wife and looked to the small bundle of joy she held in her arms. A small child, nearly a year old, rested against her mother’s breast. She had dark, nearly obsidian black hair. Her emerald green eyes were closed now, resting while the storm raged on around them. Her little fingers curled tightly around her mother’s necklace. Their calm was shattered by the sound of lightning as it hit the main mast. The following boom of thunder was loud enough to wake the dead. Deckhands scrambled as they tried to put out the fire that was quickly spreading, but another bolt of lighting struck the ship near the stern, and soon they understood their battle with the flames was a lost cause. The captain readied the life boats, and had the king and queen begin to board. A large wave crashed into the side of the ship and the queen and her child were sent flying over the side. The life boat was lowered down into the unforgiving seas. The queen tried to stay close to the boat, but between holding her child’s head above the waves and the weight of her attire, she was quickly losing strength. She felt something brush up against her. The queen was so tired at this point, her arm holding her child threatened to release her. She saw the life boat coming for her, she knew she would be safe soon. But her child.. Suddenly she felt her child being taken from her arms, as if the water itself was wishing her to drop the child. She screamed up at the skies to whatever god might be listening. \n\n“Save my baby, please! Save my Allene!” \n\nSomething came up from the waves, a sleek head, covered in scales, long like a horse’s. two horns upon the top of it’s head that looked like blackened icicles, Nearly glowing blue orbs seemed to bring the queen into a state of shock. This was a water dragon. Feared for their ever-changing moods, and loved for their kindness. The desperate mother, without a thought, handed her child up to the dragon, who took it in it’s maw gently. But as the life boats came closer, the dragon’s eyes became a glare. There was a man raging in the small life boat, he was screaming out of fear, and waved a sword in the air. The dragon gave a deep growl and sunk below the waves. \n\nThe queen screamed in horror as she watched her baby disappear beneath the black waves, her strength gave out and she began to sink, hoping to join her child in a watery grave. Large hands pulled at her soaked body before she could embrace the darkness that surrounded her and she was pulled into the chaos of life. She sobbed openly as her king held her, the dread and hatred in his eyes was enough to keep the crew silent while they worked on getting everyone safely to shore. The closest line of safety being Conach Moore, an island that held many mountains. On the eastern side there was a small village that would be able to help them get home to Riochtdome. \n\nBeneath the unforgiving waves, in the calm depths of the ocean, the water dragon still carried the young child in it’s maw, a protective barrier surrounded it so that water did not enter the child’s lungs. The dragon had sensed darkness in the King’s heart and sought to save both the mother and the child, but when she had looked for the mother, the king was already pulling her with him. With a heavy heart she took the child to her home, Farlig Dyre. It was a rather large island, filled with forests, mountains, rivers, and plains. It was a beautiful land where Humans dared not tread, and Dragons lived peacefully. She swam up to the edge of the massive cliff that served as a shoreline, digging her claws into the rough earth as she hauled her long, lithe body up the mountainous wall. Her deep blue scales dripped water and left a wet trail as she climbed over the wall and onto the soft lush grass of the northern forest. She placed the now awake, and yet peaceful child, onto the ground. She held her massive head to the sky and beckoned her elders with a roar. As she waited for the sounds of familiar wings beating against the wind, she gathered a few logs and used her claw to dig a small, shallow hole She placed the logs inside and lit a fire with her maw. Her fire was blue, but unlike most fires, it wasn’t as hot as it should be. It was warm, like a sunny day rather than a bursting inferno. She placed the child near the edge of it so as to keep it warm, spreading one of her small wings over her so as to keep her dry. She curled herself up around the child the mother had called Allene, and looked to the skies, awaiting the judgment of her elders.","title":"[FN]Dawn of Darkness: The Beginning"},"questions":[{"question":"Explain the climax of the story.","answers":[{"answer":"The climax of the story is when the water dragon saves the queen and her child.

Established in 1851 in response to the Revolutions of 1848, the organization served as an information exchange among the secret police forces of a number of German-speaking countries.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1833 a centralized internal security service was established by the German Confederation.[1] Headquartered in Frankfurt, the Central Investigating Agency consisted of several former investigating magistrates tasked with gathering information on seditious and subversive organizations—as well as the press, publishers, and bookstores—obtained by the police services of the member states of the Confederation.[2] Information collected by the Central Investigating Agency was shared with the police of the German states concerned, as well as the Federal Convention.[3] The same year, Austria established the Information Office in Mainz, which performed largely similar functions.[4] The Central Investigating Agency and Information Office were both strictly intelligence agencies, with no police power of their own. The two institutions would occasionally exchange intelligence with each other.[5]\n\nThe successful suppression of seditious elements within German-speaking states led to the permanent suspension of the Central Investigating Agency in 1842, its services no longer needed.[6] [The Police Union of German States was established after an 1851 meeting of secret police chiefs in Dresden.]\n\nFormation\n\nDuring 1848 Europe was rocked by a series of revolts and revolutions with Austria, Prussia, Hungary, Bohemia, Sicily, and France all experiencing various levels of domestic unrest.[7] In response to the events of three years prior, in 1851, the police president of Berlin – Karl Ludwig Friedrich von Hinckeldey – sent letters to law enforcement officials in Hanover, Sachsen, Dresden and Vienna calling for cross-border cooperation in the policing of political radicals.[8] As a result of von Hinckeldey's letter, a conference was held on 9 April 1851 in Dresden attended by staff from the secret police services of the independent states of Prussia, Austria, Sachsen and Hanover.[9] Before the end of the year, these forces were joined in cooperation with those of Bavaria, Baden and Württemberg and the Police Union of German States informally created.[10][11]\n\nEarly proposals to expand the police union to include political and secret police agencies outside the German-speaking world ultimately did not bear fruit, though occasional instances of cooperation – usually through middlemen – with law enforcement agencies in Belgium, Denmark and Britain are recorded.[12]\n\nDissolution and legacy\n\nThe union was dissolved in 1866 with the outbreak of the Seven Weeks' War between the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia, the two dominant countries from which the Police Union drew its membership.[13]\n\nThe Police Union of German States has been described as the first known instance of formally institutionalized international law enforcement cooperation.[14][15]\n\n\nOperations and activities\n\nThe union's activities were strictly focused on the maintenance of political order, with routine crime and criminals outside its area of interest.[16] Information on political radicals and subversive organizations were exchanged between officials of the member agencies at meetings held one to three times annually.[17] Between meetings, information would be disseminated about wanted political opponents among the member agencies through weekly magazines that would be published by the union for distribution to its participating forces.[18] The union also recruited agents in New York, London, Brussels, and Paris to gather intelligence on dissidents and radicals operating beyond the reach of its member agencies.[19]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n","title":"Police Union of German States"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about the union's formation?","answers":[{"answer":"The Police Union of German States was established after an 1851 meeting of secret police chiefs in Dresden.

Thus, the reliably feverish Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) reiterated the Left’s tiresome tropes that ensuring the integrity of American elections constitutes “a front to suppress the vote” and an effort to “perpetrate dangerous and baseless claims.” Schumer further insisted the Committee’s disbandment demonstrates that “ill-founded proposals that just appeal to a narrow group of people won’t work, and we hope they’ll learn this lesson elsewhere.”\n\nSchumer’s assertion that protecting elections resonates solely with a “narrow group” is laughable. A 2015 CBS News poll revealed a majority of Americans considered voter fraud to be fairly widespread, and a 2016 Gallup poll revealed a whopping 80% of Americans favor requiring voters to provide _photo ID_ to cast a ballot. Moreover, a 2007 Gallup poll _and_ a 2012 Washington Post poll both revealed more Americans are concerned with voter fraud than voter suppression.\n\nSo why did Trump shut down the Commission? “Despite substantial evidence of voter fraud, many states have refused to provide the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity with basic information relevant to its inquiry,” Trump said in a brief statement last Wednesday. “Rather than engage in endless legal battles at taxpayer expense, today I signed an executive order to dissolve the Commission, and have asked the Department of Homeland Security to review these issues and determine next courses of action.”\n\nLeftists will likely regret the shift and fittingly, they have only themselves to blame. As columnist Thomas Lifson explains, Democrats made so-called Russian hacking of the election “a national security issue. This opens the door for DHS — armed with far more investigatory power than any commission might exercise — to go full bore at election fraud,” he writes. “President Trump tried it the nice way, only to encounter obstruction. Now it is time for Plan B, and I am pretty sure that Democrats will not like it at all.”\n\nKobach, who led the Commission along with Pence, was equally explicit. “What’s happening is a tactical shift where the mission of the commission is being handed off to Homeland Security without the stonewalling by Democrats,” he stated. Kobach also hammered reliably leftist organizations like the ACLU and the NAACP, along with congressional Democrats and their Commission members, who attempted undermine its work at every turn. “They have absolutely no interest in stopping voter fraud,” Kobach declared. “It’s truly extraordinary that one party in our system has made clear that they don’t care.”\n\nThe most critical aspect of the change? Leftists who often use the courts to get what they want (or prevent that which they don’t) will no longer have that option. “The investigation will continue. And it will continue more efficiently and more effectively,” Kobach warned. “By throwing their food in the air, [Democrats] just lost their seat at the table.”\n\nAt least eight lawsuits have been filed against the Commission, largely based on accusations that asking for state voter data, much of which is on the public record, violated open-records laws, or breached privacy protections. Moreover, Democrat Commission member and Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap filed his own lawsuit, accusing the commission of hiding information from him. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly partially agreed, saying the panel should provide him the requested documents.\n\nDespite the commission being disbanded, Dunlap insists it still has to honor the judge’s decision. “I didn’t want to go to court,” he told The Daily Signal. “All I wanted, honest to God, was to participate and get an answer to all of my questions.”\n\nDunlap was also concerned about the change of course. “How many driver’s licenses has Homeland Security issued?” he asked rhetorically. “None. How many elections has Homeland Security run? None.”\n\nDespite Dunlap’s take, DHS’s outsider status is a _good_ thing. Driver’s licenses? Twelve states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Vermont and Washington, plus the District of Columbia — allow _illegal aliens_ to obtain driver’s licenses. Of those 12, only Utah favored Trump in the 2016 election. Only three — Washington, Nevada and Hawaii — were willing to provide the Commission with any information.\n\nAs for running an election, Americans might be shocked to discover that at least 38 states currently or will soon allow voters to register online, and 14 currently or will soon permit voters to register on Election Day. Moreover, according to Ballotpedia, 34% of the states have no ID requirement to vote, 24% have non-strict, non-photo voter ID laws, 20% have non-strict, photo ID laws, 6% have strict, non-photo ID laws, and 16% have strict, photo ID laws.\n\nIn other words, there is ample opportunity to commit voter fraud.\n\nNonetheless, Democrats would have Americans believe lax registration and voting procedures, coupled with wholesale resistance to investigations, has a non-existent or marginal impact on the integrity of elections. Moreover, they insist any effort to conduct an investigation that would either reveal fraud — or the lack thereof that would _validate_ their assertions — amounts to “a wild-goose chase for voter fraud, demonizing the very American voters whom we should all be helping to participate — with the not-so-secret goal of making voting harder with unnecessary barriers,” according to Dale Ho, director of the ACLU Voting Rights Project.\n\nThat would be the same ACLU whose executive director, Anthony D. Romero, called for the DOJ “to appoint a special prosecutor to independently investigate the Trump campaign’s ties to Russian interference in November’s election and for Congress to create a select committee, akin to the Watergate select committee, to ensure an adequate and public resolution of this crisis” — to “preserve our constitutional values.”\n\nThus, some allegations of voter fraud are “more equal than others.” And despite Democrat denials, the Commission did document 8,471 cases of double-voting in elections in 21 states, and 938 voter fraud convictions since 2000. Moreover, the same Democrats who have issues with the DHS’s current effort to supersede their resistance, had no problem when Obama administration DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson determined that state election systems were “critical infrastructure,” requiring federal oversight due to “hacking” concerns — despite no evidence of hacking.\n\nAgain for leftists, hacking by extra-national entities is highly problematic, but “hacking” by thousands of potentially ineligible or double voting individuals, including “extra-nationals” (read: illegals), is no problem at all.\n\nIn short, the Democrat Party’s stance on investigations of voter fraud is highly selective. Any DHS investigations that might prove inimical to their interests amounts to “disenfranchisement,” while any investigation that even hints at delegitimizing the current president — courtesy of a Special Counsel armed with extra-constitutional power — must be pursued with unrelenting vigor.\n\nHow Democrats miss the searing irony that the special counsel’s investigation provides a powerful justification for the DHS’s investigation is anyone’s guess.\n\nLet the proverbial chips fall where they may.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize what the article has to say about voter fraud.

Now, I know that for one reason or another there are some people who have sought to question that these really are our intentions … these fears about a race to the bottom are based on nothing – not history, not intention nor interest.”\n\nBritish officials highlighted a recent warning in a European commission presentation to member states relating to workplace safety standards that appeared to suggest UK workers could be at higher risk of cancer after Brexit.\n\nOne slide suggested that the UK might cut “levels of occupational safety and health” leading to “higher exposure to chemicals and carcinogens”, and that workers could have their consultation rights cut to reduce delays for collective dismissals.\n\nDavis will use the speech to hit back at that suggestion, outlining UK hopes that “mutual recognition” of regulations will continue after Brexit.\n\nHe will add: “They fear that Brexit could lead to an Anglo-Saxon race to the bottom. With Britain plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction. These fears about a race to the bottom are based on nothing, not history, not intention, nor interest.”\n\nThe minister’s attempt to reassure critics of the process for leaving the EU follow comments from Damian Green, until recently the prime minister’s de facto deputy, that could ramp up tensions over Brexit within the Conservative party.\n\nIn a BBC Radio 4 documentary, he questioned the ability of some pro-Brexit colleagues to “accept evidence” of the economic risks of leaving the EU, and said the government ought to publish such analysis in full after it is produced.\n\n“I do reject all the conspiracy theories that suggest there’s some sort of plot inside the official machine to thwart the will of the people,” added Green, after a row in parliament in which high-profile Tory MPs questioned the impartiality of civil servants.\n\nDavis’s speech on standards sets out some of the key issues to be discussed by cabinet ministers at May’s Chequers away day on Thursday.\n\nThe team, which includes ardent Brexiters and others who campaigned to remain, are coalescing around the idea of a system in which Britain will argue in favour of aligning with the EU in some areas but immediately diverging in others.\n\nDavis’s reassurances on continued high standards coincide with a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research that suggests minimal support for deregulation.\n\nAn IPPR/Opinium poll found that more than 60% of the public want to retain or tighten the rules on vehicle fuel emissions, rising to more than 70% for renewable energy targets, the working time directive and a cap on bankers’ bonuses, and more than 80% for consumer cancellation rights. Only a tiny proportion say they would be happy to relax or remove such conditions.\n\nThe report, which argues in favour of staying closer to the European model of trade rather than the US one, also warns that there are signs that the UK wants to deregulate.\n\nIt highlights: the fact that the EU largely sets minimum standards not maximum ones; that many senior figures have argued strongly in favour of deregulation; and that the UK may not have the resources to keep up with changes to EU regulations after Brexit so will converge “by accident rather than design”.\n\nIt also says that the UK, as a “mid-sized economy”, can only maximise its trading benefits by aligning to a larger bloc, with the EU or US being the obvious options.\n\nTom Kibasi, the director of the IPPR, said: “Our research shows there is no appetite for deregulation post-Brexit. Regulatory divergence is both anti-worker and anti-business, so it should be no surprise that the public don’t want it.\n\n“Our proposal for the ‘shared market’, where Britain and the single market would be aligned and in a customs union, remains the best way to secure our economic interests while honouring the vote to leave.”\n\nGovernment officials admitted that Davis’s call for “higher standards” did not mean there would be no deregulation, suggesting that Brexit would allow the UK to regulate in a different manner.\n\nOne senior EU diplomat said everyone wanted frictionless trade, and that it would arguably help if the UK adopted EU standards on a broad scale.\n\n“But even with this, this will not alter the fact that there will be a border between us. And that there will be enforcement of such a border in terms of not only tariffs, but verification that the UK actually meets the standards they need to export into the EU,” he said, also listing checks for counterfeited goods or trafficking.\n\nThe international trade secretary, Liam Fox, will also stress the benefits of high standards in a speech to the manufacturing industry on Tuesday, calling UK-produced goods “a kitemark of quality, innovation and world-leading technological advances”.\n\nFox will tell business leaders at the EEF conference that there will be a “functioning trade regime on day one” after Brexit.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about Damian Green?","answers":[{"answer":"Damian Green is Theresa May's de facto deputy.

The groups shown to be most vulnerable to social stigma are people of East Asian descent or appearance, people who have traveled abroad, people who have recently completed quarantine, healthcare professionals and emergency service workers. It has also been shown that wearing or refusing to wear a mask has become subject to a stigma[3] as well. The existence of such social stigma[4] and their negative impacts have been documented by many organizations, including UNICEF, the WHO, and the CDC.[5][6][7][8]\n\n\nReasons for and impact of social stigma\n\nThe level of stigma towards those affected with COVID-19 is due to multiple factors. The virus is new, and there are many unknowns surrounding transmission and a possible cure. Many people cannot access tests and[9] drug development for treatment is still in progress. Meanwhile, there is widespread misinformation regarding the disease, under which various online groups and activists have spread conspiracy theories and unproven claims, including: that the virus was created in a laboratory; the virus was “planned”; and that the virus was caused by 5G networks, among other theories.[10][11][12]\n\nIn this cultural context, the disease itself is an unknown—and, according to many international health experts, people feel fearful when confronted with the unknown. In such circumstances, they may deal with this fear by assigning blame to the “other,” [13] which may include groups of people, governments, or institutions. This environment can fuel harmful stereotypes. As a result, social cohesion is undermined, and there may be increased social isolation of impacted groups. With this social isolation, people may be less likely to seek out medical help or services, take necessary precautions, or seek out social services, due to fear of discrimination. This can contribute to a situation in which the virus is more likely to spread, leading to severe health problems and difficulties in controlling disease outbreak.[14] Furthermore, people could also subjected to physical violence[15] and hate crimes.\n\n\nAddressing social stigma\n\nIn order to address social stigma, it is important to build trust in reliable health services and advice, show empathy to the affected individuals and adopting effective practical measures to keep people safe.[16] The following measures are recommended to address social stigma by the UNICEF:[17]\n\n-   Use of people-first language, that respects the individual and talking about the disease with a positive tone in all communication channels, including media, such as:\n    -   Not attaching ethnicity or locations to the disease, such as 'Wuhan virus' or 'Asian virus' and using only the official name COVID-19\n    -   Using 'people who have COVID-19' instead of 'COVID-19 cases' or 'COVID-19 victims' or 'COVID-19 suspects'\n    -   Using terminology like, people 'acquiring' or 'contracting' COVID-19 instead of people 'transmitting COVID-19', 'infecting others' or 'spreading the virus' as it implies intentional transmission and assigns blame\n    -   Refrain from using criminalising or dehumanising terminology in a way that might create impression that those with the disease have done something wrong, thereby feeding stigma\n    -   Speaking the facts about COVID-19 accurately, based on scientific data and latest official health advice\n    -   Not repeating or sharing unconfirmed rumors, and avoiding using of exaggerative terms like 'plague' and 'apocalypse' to denote the pandemic\n    -   Emphasizing the effectiveness of prevention and treatment measures, rather than dwelling on the negatives or messages of threat.\n-   Spreading accurate and updated facts, such as by:\n    -   Using simple language and avoiding clinical terminology\n    -   Engaging social influencers, such as religious or political leaders and celebrities to amplify the message in a geographically and culturally appropriate way\n    -   Amplifying the stories and images of local people who have recovered or supported a loved one through the recovery from COVID-19\n    -   Portraying of different ethnic groups, and use of symbols and formats that are neutral and not suggestive of any ethnic group\n    -   Practicing ethical journalism: Reports that overly focus on patient responsibility can increase stigma for people who may have the disease. News that speculates the source of COVID-19 in each country, for example, can increase stigma towards such individuals.\n    -   Linking up to the other initiatives that address social stigma and stereotyping\n-   Observe communication tips:[18]\n    -   Correct misconceptions, while acknowledging that people's feelings and subsequent behaviour are real, even if their underlying assumptions are false.\n    -   Share sympathetic narratives and stories that humanise the struggles of affected individuals and groups\n    -   Communicate support for those working in the frontline\n\nAccording to United Nations Population Fund, midwives play an essential role in reducing stigma and battling the spreading belief that health facilities are to be avoided.[19]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n","title":"Social stigma associated with COVID-19"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about the pandemic and social stigma?","answers":[{"answer":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to social stigma due to multiple factors such as the virus being new and vague, most-especially due to conspiracy theories spread by online groups, unproven claims such as the virus being due to 5G networks, or that it was created in a laboratory.

He had a look of anticipation, as if he was waiting for some pain relieving gossip. \n\n“I was home,” I responded innocently before he rolled his eyes at me. “Now, don’t bother me, I’m trying to focus.” Although normally I would use anything to distract me from school, I wasn’t about to involve Max in last night’s mess.\n\n“Are you expecting me to believe you weren’t at Nina’s party?” He raised his eyebrows at me. I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me. Perhaps I couldn’t fix her parent’s divorce, but I could at least attend her house party. Especially after her break up with Todd, the leather jacket douche that called her “babe” so much I would wonder if he knew her real name.\n\n“I promise you’ll have a great time,” Nina had told me. And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle. Something nostalgic about repetitive rap songs preaching about the wonders of big asses. \n\nEverything seemed normal at first. The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room. I could feel the air thickening. \n\nMinutes before terror, I was standing unnoticed next to a group of girls I recognized. \n\n“Someone told me her dad was abusive,” I heard one say with wide eyes. \n\n“Yeah, apparently the neighbors called the cops on them,” another responded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t point fingers just yet. Nina’s mom’s a bitch. Maybe she deserved it,” a brunette shrugged and took a sip of her drink right before our eyes met. Her face flared red as she realized her words had been overhead. I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry. A millisecond later, I spotted Nina on the floor. Hands covering her face in defense. The lack of light in the room didn’t stop the fierceness of her blood as it dripped down her temple and into her hair. \n\nI stood still. My brain called in fear but my body made no response. Not even when Todd walked passed me, into the hallway and shut the door behind him. \n\nNina remained on the floor. She held herself and rocked back and forth, letting silent cries out into the thick air. \n\n“Don’t tell anyone.” She whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” Max snapped at me. “Are you going to tell me or not?” I stared at him blankly as the vivid flashbacks flew through my head.

It featured the quarterback and the slogan: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. Just do it.”\n\nKaepernick, 30, has been without a team since opting out of his San Francisco 49ers contract in March 2017. In 2016 he was an originator of protests by NFL players, targeting racial injustice and police brutality, which often involve kneeling during the pre-game playing of the national anthem.\n\nDonald Trump has made the protests a key part of his appeal to his base, arguing that the players are disrespecting the anthem, the US flag and the military.\n\nOn Tuesday, the president told the rightwing website Daily Caller: “I think it’s a terrible message that [Nike] are sending and the purpose of them doing it, maybe there’s a reason for them doing it. But I think as far as sending a message, I think it’s a terrible message and a message that shouldn’t be sent. There’s no reason for it.”\n\nHe also said Nike paid him “a lot of rent” in New York and admitted that the protests and the Nike ad were “in another way … what this country is all about, that you have certain freedoms to do things that other people think you shouldn’t do”.\n\n“But I personally am on a different side of it,” Trump said.\n\nIn the following days, the president pursued the issue via Twitter. On Wednesday, he wrote: “Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN, Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? As far as the NFL is concerned, I just find it hard to watch, and always will, until they stand for the FLAG!”\n\nTrump did not supply evidence for his claim of “anger and boycotts” but opposition to the company’s move was expressed widely and in some instances creatively on social media.\n\nOn Friday, the morning after the full version of the Nike ad played during the Philadelphia Eagles v Atlanta Falcons NFL season opener, the president asked: “What was Nike thinking?”\n\nNike releases full ad featuring Colin Kaepernick - video\nEdison Trends’ analysis suggested the company will be thinking its gambit has worked, allowing it to surf familiar controversy and create a “Trump bump” all of its own.\n\n“Nike’s 2018 late summer sales show much the same trend as last year’s,” the company wrote, “with order volume decreasing slightly going into late August. The similarity decreases coming out of Labor Day weekend, however, with sales seeing a bigger bump on Monday and Tuesday than in the past.”\n\nEdison Trends said its analysis was based on “anonymised and aggregated e-receipts from more than 3 million consumers”.\n\nThe NFL has not resolved how to respond to or govern the protests, which were widely discussed again on Thursday after Eagles defensive end Michael Bennett sat down before the anthem had finished.\n\nIn July, in an open letter to league owners, the NBA great and Guardian sports columnist Kareem Abdul Jabbar wrote: “It’s been two years since Colin Kaepernick first took a knee to protest systemic racial injustice, especially police brutality, against people of color.\n\n“The worst thing about that isn’t that two years later we’re still debating whether players have the right to protest, it’s that not much has changed regarding what Kaepernick was protesting.”\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the arguments against Kaepernick.","answers":[{"answer":"Donald Trump argues that the protests are disrespectful to the anthem, the US flag, and the military.

Picture looking E.] [Upper part of the landslide that generated the tsunami that destroyed most of the Chungar Mine camp in 1971. Picture looking S.]\n\nThe CHUNGAR MINE, inactive, exploited a polymetallic (Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag) skarn deposit in the high Andes of central Peru. It is located about 116 km NE of Lima, 57 km southwest of Cerro de Pasco, and 82 km northwest of La Oroya in the (Santa Cruz de Andamarca District, Huaral Province, Lima Region, , 4380 m.a.s.l.). In 1971, a landslide-generated wave (“landslide tsunami”[1]) at the Yanawayin Lake destroyed most of the surface facilities and killed 200-600 persons,[2][3] including miners in flooded underground workings.[4]\n\nThe mine was owned by Cia. Minera Chungar, S.A.C. After the 1971 disaster, this mining company, keeping the same name, transferred the operations 16 km NE to the Animón mine in the Huarón Mining District.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2008, Compañía Minera Cerro S.A. rehabilitated some underground workings and had a small scale operation.\n\nSince 2015, the mining company Volcan is exploring the surroundings of the Chungar Mine (Romina project) including the Puagjanca area where a Zn-Pb-(Ag) ore body was discovered.[5]\n\n\nConfusion on the term “Chungar Mine”\n\nThe mining company Volcan through its now subsidiary Compañía Minera Chungar S.A.C.[6], operates the polymetallic Animón and Islay mines, in the Huarón Mining District, located 16 km NE of the actual Chungar Mine, under the term “Mining Unit Chungar”[7] (Unidad minera Chungar[8]). The use by Volcan of this term “Chungar Mining Unit”[9][10][11] has caused some confusion, and certain sources (e.g., the data base “alicia.concytec.gob.pe”[12] and a WoodMackenzie Report[13]) use wrongly the term of “Chungar mine” for the Animón mine.\n\n\nGeological Frame\n\nThe Chungar skarn deposit belongs to the Miocene polymetallic belt of Central Peru.[14] The skarn Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag mineralization occurs mainly at the western contact of the Chungar Granite with limestone of the Cretaceous Jumasha Formation and in roof pendants.[15] Ore consists mainly of sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, and pyrrhotite in andradite skarn.[16] Age determinations on the outcropping Chungar granite yield an age of 12.88 ± 0.36 Ma (Ar/Ar biotite plateau age)[17] that is consistent with previous K-Ar age determinations.[18]\n\nSimilar skarn occurrences are known north and south of the Chungar Mine (e.g. Don Miguel prospect, , 8 km north of the Chungar Mine and 1 km E of the Chalhuacocha granodiorite, which was K-Ar dated at 10.0±0.3 Ma on biotite,[19] and the Puagjanca ore body, 4 km to the south[20]).\n\n[1] https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-do-landslides-cause-tsunamis?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products landslide tsunamis, USGS, retrieved on April 15, 2020\n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] Volcan 2019; Memoria Anual 2018; 199 p.\n\n[6] Company profile Compañía Minera Chungar S.A.C.,bnamericas.com, retrieved on April 6, 2020\n\n[7] Volcan, Mining units, retrieved on April 6, 2020\n\n[8] Volcan, Unidades Mineras, retrieved on April 6, 2020\n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] miningdataonline\n\n[12] Data Base “alicia.concytec.gob.pe” retrieved on April 6, 2020\n\n[13] Chungar zinc mine, WoodMackenzie Report, retrieved on April 6, 2020\n\n[14] Noble, D.

He doesn’t look old, so he can’t be all that wise. All that work he does and all the times he leaves - it’s not normal.  I was  sick of wondering.\n\n\tI finally got into his castle and he was at his workbench. When I got closer he looked back at me, seemingly confused, but he turned back around and kept tinkering with some weird red dust. I got closer and mustered up the courage to ask him as politely as I could, “How come you’re so different than everyone else?” The king stopped, stood up and looked at me. He asked, “Excuse me?” and I said it again. He chuckled briefly under his breath and said “it seems like you’re different too.”\n\t\n       He started to tell me a story. “When I was your age, I lived in a different kingdom and I felt the same way about my king. I would go to school and all the kids and the teachers would seem to just drift through their lives, but not the king; he was always spontaneous. I was finally sick of that curious feeling, so I went and talked to my king and he told me his story. Sometime afterwards the kingdom was destroyed and all the people inside were attacked by monsters. It was terrible. There were explosions, arrows, and the groans of the undead. \n\n\tI was able to escape, but barely. I fought my way out with nothing but my hands. finally I found a break in the chaos and I found a cave and covered the entrance with dirt. I was devastated, but I wanted to live so I built a shelter.  I enjoyed building. Then since I had built my shelter I began mining - I enjoyed that as well. I had so many supplies I decided to build more and I ended up building a village. Strangely enough people appeared. That village moved on to become this kingdom. That’s my story.”\n\n\tI asked him why he told me all that. and he told me simply because I was a player. A player? I was so confused. He then told me that only players are kings. I didn’t understand. He went on by asking me what my earliest memory is and I told him standing outside. “Exactly,” He said. “That was the first time you entered this world.” He started talking about how this life isn’t real and that once he’s gone he’ll be able to enter the real world again.\n\n\tHe began taking me adventuring with him, that’s when he would explain things and share his knowledge with me. “When a king dies, everything he ever did goes with him. That’s how my king’s old kingdom was destroyed. I left my Kingdom and made a village. I have people of my own now. My king was killed by a mob of three suicide creatures right outside his gate. I saw everything he had made disappear along with him.” That’s when I believed everything he told me - while he took me adventuring with him. Now I know that there is a better life to be had out of this one. A less edged and more rounded one. Thank you king Steve.

Water is inanimate. It can neither dwell nor sit. What does water do? Rest? Lie? \n\nPerch?\n\n-'Perch'? Are we out of our linguistic mind? Water is not a cat! All those earlier description failures are attempts at personifying a thing. I suppose water CAN course (but only when there is an active current and gravity to push the molecules). In most ordinary instances that we can think of, it appears that water can only 'be' (as far as within the flat, level environment of a deep, lonely well.)\n\nOk then. let's try again. \"Down in the well, the water just was.\"\n\n-Humm. We can't think of a good rhyme for 'was'. We were going to try 'cause' in the next line but that's a real stretch to rhyme 'was' and 'cause'. Maybe we should actually try to personify the water. That might be interesting.\n\n\"Down in the well the water lurked. It was such a ridiculous construct it made us smirk.\"\n\n-Yeah, 'lurked' and 'smirk' are too silly to use in serious writing and we're still uncomfortable with the idea of personifying a thing. \n\n'Bubbled'? 'Gurgled'? 'Rested'? 'Was corralled'? 'Contained within'? That last one is technically accurate but it's too awkward to 'flow' smoothly into a verse. \n\n-Hummm, flow? Nah. 'Flow' also implies gravitational action that wouldn't be at work inside a well. \n\n'Floated'?  \n\n-Well, that's somewhat accurate but really other things float IN water. They work against the collection of hydrogen and oxygen molecules to be buoyant. \n\nCan't something float within itself? \n\n-Nah, too metaphysical. We must keep the poem easy to comprehend. \n\nPoem? Who says this is a POEM? Does it have to be? Dude! Maybe it's a gruesome horror story and there's a dead body floating IN the tepid water! \n\n   \"Down in the well, the water contained the bloated body of Randolph Ringhoffer.\"\n\nDoes the name 'Ringhoffer' or having double 'R' initials distract from the story idea? Should we have used a more common name like 'Jones'? \n\n-What does it matter at this point, 'dude'? How can anything distract a reader if we only have one sentence so far? It's silly to worry about such things this early.\n\n   That's not true at all. I happen to already know that Mr. Ringhoffer was intentionally pushed into the well by an angry malcontent. He drowned. He's been floating there five weeks in the stagnant, festering pool. His restless spirit has been getting angrier by the minute until someone extracts revenge on... Butch Cas... er... Carson. The local outlaw, Butch Carson.\n\n-'Outlaw'? Open well? 'Malcontent'? 'Butch'? Is this a 'Wild West' roundup tale or something? Those aren't common terms and situations for modern times. \n\n   As a matter of fact it is, Mr. Negative. It takes place in 1887, in frontier Wyoming. That's where Mr. Ringhoffer's cattle ranch is. What's with all the single quotes, anyway? Is that a manifestation of your contempt for my writing choices? \n\n-Take it easy, 'hoss'. I'm just echoing the subconscious thoughts of your potential readers. That's the sort of thing that would occur to them. You know I'm your inner monologue. It's my job to critique and challenge you creatively. Otherwise you do not grow as a writer and storyteller.\n\nIf you are just a part of my creativity, how do you know what others will think about my details? What innate insight do you have? You're just an annoying voice in my head.\n \n -As a matter of fact, myself and the inner monologues of everyone else in the world gets together for big discussions and conferences. We evaluate things. We discuss YOU and your penchant to over-analyze small details. It's sad really. We feel you could achieve some great things if you'd just let the writing occur naturally. Stop agonizing over minute details.\n\nOk. Fair enough. I understand 'you' are just trying to help. Could we have a little more 'constructive' and a little less outright 'criticism'?\n\n-Yes. Sure. I don't want you to feel discouraged either. It's a balancing act. I'm digging the story idea so far. I'm anxious to see where you go with it.

It is located in the Municipality of Pivka in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. It has many marked trails and a macadamized road leading to its peak. There is a historical trail intended for tourists with many information signs around its peak. It served an important military role during the Second World War, since it contained many tunnels and bunkers used by Italian army.[2]It is named after St. Primož and the Felicijan church, which was abandoned in the eighteenth century with practically no ruins leftover.[3]\n\n\nLocation\n\nPrimož is located in the Municipality of Pivka in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. The town of Pivka is built on the northern and northeastern slopes of Primož.[4] It has a commanding view over the entire Pivka basin which contributed to its military importance during the Second World War.\n\n\nHistory\n\nAfter the end of World War 1, Primož hill became Italian territory following an agreement between Italy, Great Britain, France and Russia alongside South Tyrol, Istria, Dalmatia and various islands in the Adriatic sea. On November 12th, 1920, the border was drawn in accordance with the Treaty of Rapallo, crossing the Pivka basin, on the ridge of the Javorniki mountain chain. Primož's military tunnels were dug in 1930 as a part of the long Alpine Wall, a vast series of Italian Defense fortifications. The tunnels consisted of two lines; one directly on the border, and the second one a few kilometers behind it. Locals were kept away from the tunnels, and were only allowed to bring basic materials and food near its premises. The tunnels were constructed only by verified members of the Italian National Fascist Party.[5] The tunnels were secured with steel plates coated with a thick layer of concrete. The tunnels are long in total,[6] but they were never used for military purposes.[7] After the withdrawal of Italian forces, local people took valuables from the area, and in 1944, German forces destroyed the tunnels in fear that allied Partisans would find military use for them.[8]\n\nThere are a number of tourist trails leading to the peak. The historical trail has information signs at the summit which explain the history of Primož in detail.

PLANT-BASED MEAT COMPANIES, LIKE IMPOSSIBLE FOODS AND BEYOND MEAT, ALREADY SELL THEIR ITEMS AT SUPERMARKETS AND RESTAURANTS.\n-   THE DEBATE WILL LIKELY INTENSIFY.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the first time, a major part of the US beef industry is taking aim at tech startups creating meat — without animals — that tastes like the real thing. (These startups fall into two major buckets: companies that make meat from plants, and others that are growing real meat using animal cells in labs.)\n\nIn February, the US Cattlemen’s Association (USCA) filed a 15-page petition to the USDA asking the agency to strictly define \"meat\" and \"beef\" as animals raised and slaughtered. The group argues that displaying plant-based meat products next to traditional meat items could confuse customers, especially when they're labeled as chicken or beef.\n\nPlant-based and lab-grown meat startups are refuting that argument.\n\nEthan Brown, the CEO of the plant-based foods company Beyond Meat, believes that its burgers serve the same purpose as traditional beef.\n\n\"Why can't we call it a piece of meat? It has the same things in it, it presents the same way, and it performs the same function,\" he told Capital Public Radio. \"A lot like we call the mobile phone a phone, and we don’t call it a fake landline.\"\n\nJosh Tetrick, CEO of the food-tech startup Just (formerly called Hampton Creek), told Business Insider that tech companies and the beef industry should work together on creating the future of meat. Just produces plant-based foods, like eggless mayonnaise, and it's also working on a cultured — or lab-grown — meat product.\n\n\"I understand better than most the nuances and challenges of product naming,\" said Tetrick, who won a similar battle over labeling Just's eggless mayo as mayo in 2015. \"My biggest takeaway is this: The leaders of the national and global meat industry want to feed the world animal protein in a sustainable way. That’s a shared interest that should be celebrated.\" \n\n\nBig Beef is divided on how to fight fake meat startups\n\nBy filing an official motion, the country's ranchers are showing cultured and plant-based meat startups that they are prepared to fight for the definition of meat.\n\n\"[The government] should require that any product labeled as 'beef' come from cattle that have been born, raised, and harvested in the traditional manner, rather than coming from alternative sources such as a synthetic product from plant, insects, or other non-animal components and any product grown in labs from animal cells,\" the USCA wrote.\n\n[]\n\nAn Impossible Foods employee works at the company's headquarters in Redwood City, California.\n Melia Robinson\nBut not every group within the beef industry agrees on how to challenge these startups.\n\nIn April, the more-powerful National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA) sent a letter to the USDA, arguing for the opposite ruling as the USCA.\n\nThe NCBA's position may seem counterintuitive, but as Quartz notes, the move is likely part of a larger strategy to fight fake meat startups. By putting their products under the oversight of the USDA, lab-grown and plant-based meat companies would need to adhere to the USDA's existing regulations on meat, which could hamper research and development. \n\n\nFake meat startups — attracting hundreds of millions in venture capital — say that they're not backing down\n\nIn the petition, the USCA mentions Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, companies that are each backed by millions in VC funding. The group also calls out Memphis Meats, Just, and Mosa Meats — three startups that are racing to bring lab-grown meat to market.\n\nRecent venture-capital investments could make that more commercially feasible.\n\nIn January, Tyson Foods announced that it had invested in Memphis Meats, joining the startup's list of prominent backers including Bill Gates, the food giant Cargill, and Richard Branson. \n\nPlant-based meat companies have also caught the attention of VCs. In 2016, Tyson also bought a 5% stake in Beyond Meat, a company that sells plant-based burgers, chicken, and sausage in grocery stores. Meanwhile, Impossible Foods has chosen to sell its burgers exclusively in restaurants. Until recently, Impossible's patties were only available at select food establishments for over $10. But in April, the company debuted $2 sliders at 140 White Castle locations across New York, New Jersey, and Illinois.\n\nJust could be the first cultured food startup to get its meat to stores. Last year, the company said it plans to do so by the end of this year. Memphis Meats and Mosa Meats say they will start offering their products to the public in 2021.\n\n\"We have made progress in all areas that needed improvements — creating fat tissue, creating color, moving towards serum-free culturing — but we’re not there yet,\" Mosa Meats CEO Peter Verstrate previously told Business Insider.\n\nProponents of meat-mimicking food argue that it's more environmentally friendly than raising traditional livestock. \n\nThis month, a group of scientists from the University of Oxford published the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet. The new research suggests that without dairy and meat consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by over 75% — an area equivalent to the US, China, European Union, and Australia combined — and still feed the world. Globally, traditional animal farming accounts for about 18% of all greenhouse emissions, uses 47,000 square miles of land annually, and exhausts 70% of the world's water.\n\nAs startups improve their meat alternatives, the debate over what can legally be considered meat will likely intensify.\n\nLoading\nSomething is loading.\n[]\n\nMore: BI Innovation Agriculture Food lab-grown meat\nChevron icon\nIt indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about the USCA?","answers":[{"answer":"The US Cattlemen's Association (USCA) is taking aim at tech startups creating meat without animals that taste like the real thing.

Tonight started like any other, Hunter was prepared for another uneventful night of watching nothing happen on the monitors. When he showed up at the observation wing of the base, Hunter expressed his disinterest for his assignment to the attending officer as he always does. He thinks his job is a waste of time and resources. He is dresses in full uniform, has to have a special security clearance and works in a secret area of a heavily guarded military facility ... all to look at a wall of monitors that tell him the universe looks normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Why use the most expensive telescopes humanity has ever built to look for something we don't even think exists?\" is his usual complaint. Every officer at the base has heard this at least a dozen times, however they remind Hunter that orders are orders and insist that Hunter shouldn't complain about being given such a simple job. His only responsibility is to report unusual feedback from telescopes and sensors, if anything unusual ever comes through. He knows the Array is really being used to look for signs of an incoming attack from an extraterrestrial race and not to monitor supernova candidate stars, which is what the public is told. \"The big wigs have been watching too many space operas\" Hunter would say to anyone who would listen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point humanity has not even found definitive proof of life outside of our solar system, much less signs of intelligence. The closest we have seen is a rocky planet with nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide in its atmosphere. Hunter knew that the atmosphere of this planet was mostly oxygen with relatively small amounts of the other gasses, so if a living creature there tried to use fire the entire planet would ignite. Anything living there would be stuck in the stone age. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite his skepticism, Hunter takes over monitor duty at 11 PM as he always does. At 1:07 PM some of the sensors start to detect something in a pocket of seemingly empty space about 17 light years away. One sensor detects an emission of gamma rays, another one detected x rays. This caught Hunter's attention as it is unusual for an area of empty space to emit such radiation. Hunter decided to take a look at the area with telescopes. He sent instructions an an infrared, visible light, and a radio telescope to survey the area. He was perplexed that both of them showed absolutely nothing even though the radiation levels were reaching levels that were theorized to be the upper limit of what the most powerful stars could emit. Because the telescopes couldn't see anything, Hunter was looking at data that told him a massive amount of radiation was either appearing out of nothing, or leaking into our universe. Hunter decoded that he would restart the sensors and receiving satellites to try and make sure these weren't false readings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs he was waiting for the sensors to come back on, the infrared telescope he pointed at the area gave an alert. It had detected a momentary spike and drop to normal of heat in the area, which did not match the ever increasing readings from the other sensors. Hunter hoped the sensors would come back on, show nothing, and he could submit a simple sensor anomaly report to his superiors. These hopes were crushed when the sensors started returning information again. Not only did they pick up the radiation again, they were maxed out. Hunter couldn't believe it. He stared in awe, unable to come up with any explanation for what was going on in front of his eyes. Moments later, all the telescopes started giving alerts. The visible light telescope detected light levels akin to a supernova 100 light years away. The radio telescope was showing what could best be described as trying to broadcast every radio station from one antenna. The infrared telescope was telling him that this area of space, empty a few minutes ago, was engulfed in flames. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen it all stopped. Everything observing the anomaly stopped transmitting data. Hunter thought it was an issue with the receiving satellites, however a check revealed they were functioning properly. He tried restarting the sensors and telescopes, but simply could not get any data from them. Hunter decided this was unusual enough to report to the officers and senior scientists at the base. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe called an emergency meeting, having to wake up generals, astronomers, and physicists in the middle of the night. He thought that his news wouldn't be well received at such a time, however his training told him to go through with the protocol right away. After everyone had been assembled and lots of coffee had been consumed, hunter began to present the data and his recollection of the events. He was surprised as the others began to look horrified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the generals pointed at Hunter and said \"Just to be clear son, you can never tell anyone outside this room what you just told us\". He then excused hunter from his post, and told him that he would file his honorable discharge papers immediately if Hunter wished to leave the force. \"Did I just detect something from out of this world?\" Hunter asked the general, to which one of the physicists replied in a solemn tone \"Out of this universe\".

They looked perfectly normal and sturdy on the outside, but on the inside they were run down and falling apart. Inside of one lived a quiet and peaceful man, and in the other lived a beautiful and cheerful woman. Neither of them, however, liked being outside the confines of their own house.\n\nOne day, the peaceful man ventured across the street to the other house and was invited inside. The two strangers visited, shared laughs, told stories, and enjoyed the others company. At the end of the day, the man returned to his house.\n\nThe next day he visited again, but instead of talking, he started to slowly repair the inside of the run down house. When one of his repairs would break, he would immediately come over to fix the damage with a smile on his face. The two housekeepers became used to seeing one another each day, and eventually, the woman would come over to the man's house to visit. The woman noticed that his house looked much worse on the inside than hers, and started to sneak inside at night while he was asleep to make repairs. When the man would try to fix something himself, or repair damages to his own house, he would fail, and sometimes even make things worse. But the next morning,  he would notice that things would be fixed. This puzzled the man and he decided to ask the woman about it the next time she came over.\n\nThe next evening they spent together, he asked and she informed the man of what she had been doing, and the man asked why. She replied,\n\"Because people who show a caring and wholesome heart deserve to receive the same treatment they give to others.\" The man became confused.\n          \"But I am a shut in. Nobody gives to me, and I don't give to them. Why does somebody like me deserve somebody as wonderful as you?\"\n\nThe woman put her hand on the man's shoulder and looked into his dark brown eyes. She noticed a hurt that had always seemed to hide beneath his smile, a sorrow that hadn't been revealed in a very long time. She said in a soft and gentle voice: \"Somebody that prefers to be alone does not always prefer being lonely. There is always somebody who will care.\"\n\nThe two embraced, and the man sobbed and became limp in the woman's arms. Once he had calmed down, the woman kissed him on the cheek and returned to her house without saying a word.\n\nThe following morning, he noticed another man performing landscaping on her lawn, painting the outside of her house, and cleaning her patio. Each day the house would look more and more beautiful. He became sad that the woman had found somebody else to do her work, and started to loathe the landscaper that would beautify her house all the time.\n\nThe woman remained indoors all day, trying to make the interior of her house look as pleasant as the exterior. However, most of her attempts at repairs or renovation were disasters. The person she hired was no help, and was only after her money. She began to miss her neighbors company, along with his sturdy repairs and his gentle smile. As days went by, the man and woman thought about each other more and more, but never saw each other.\n\nOne afternoon, the woman heard her doorbell ring. Knowing it wasn't the landscaper she hired, she curiously approached the peephole of the door. Seeing that nobody was outside, she opened the door and looked for pranksters. Looking down, she saw a small, dirty looking tin with a bow neatly placed on top of it.\n\nThe interior of the unkempt tin was extravagantly decorated with soft velvet from top to bottom, and in the center laid a simple necklace with a key on it, resting on top of a small note. Putting the necklace on, she unfolded the small note and noticed little droplets of water on the page.\n\n\"You are the only one that can make it feel less empty. Please take care of it for me while I'm gone. I must go, but I will return one day.\"\n\nAfter reading it the woman dropped to her knees, and tears started to form in her tightly shut eyes. For what seemed like years, she spent the next few months wishing the man would come back and going into his house to take care of it while he was gone. She noticed that every little thing she had done to the house remained unchanged, as if he never tried to correct the small mistakes she had made.\n\nEventually, the man returned. The woman was thrilled and filled with happiness, but also saddened by the fact that the man no longer came across the street to visit her. A few days after his return, she noticed he was packing his belongings into boxes. Fearing that he might move away, the woman mustered up the courage to go talk to the man.\n\n\"Why are you putting everything into boxes?\" The woman asked.\n    \"Because,\" the man replied solemnly, \"I am looking to create new memories and find a fresh start.\" The woman said nothing and returned to her house, slamming the door and fighting back tears.\n\nThe next morning, the man was loading his belongings into a moving truck when he saw a pile of boxes bigger than his own sitting in the woman's lawn. He walked across the street to the pile, and saw a note taped to one of the boxes.\n\n\"I will always love you, and I promise that I will always be next to you. No matter where we go.\"\n\nThe man's face turned into a broad smile, and he looked up to see the woman on her front patio, looking right back at him, the necklace glistening in the sunlight. She ran into his arms and they kissed for what felt like an eternity. The pair continued to load all of their belongings into the one moving truck, and left that very evening. Holding hands with his true love, the man looked into the rear view mirror to see the sun setting on the old, abandoned houses for the last time, and felt what was truly a pure happiness. An odd and relieving sensation washed over him like a tide, as he realized that he would never have to search for anything in his life, as long as he lived.\n","title":"Some OC for you all to enjoy"},"questions":[{"question":"What are the reasons behind the peaceful man's continual visits to the cheerful woman's house?","answers":[{"answer":"One of them is to fix leaks after fixing his own house.

It was a familiar voice that brought him back to reality, “Hey Joey, the boys and I are headin’ over to the Libya Cafe on 131st.You comin’?” He looked up and saw his closest friend Robert Frost, “Naw, you go on ahead. I’ll catch up to you later.” \n   \n Joseph and Robert were part of the 369th infantry regiment, formerly known as the New York Fifteenth National Guard, who spent 191 consecutive days on the front lines in the war-ravaged French countryside. He reflected back on the first day he and a rag-tag ensemble of fellow African-Americans fell into a hap-hazard formation in front of the same theater which he now sat on the front steps of. He also thought about the nonstop drilling and training at Camp Whitman that instilled in him and the rest of the NY15NG their first real sense of pride. After Whitman came remedial security detail, guarding rail lines and terminals in New York City. Eventually Joey and the 369th were shipped out to France. Joey thought the French were wonderful people, devoid of the bigotry and prejudice that white folk seemed all too willing to express stateside. The 369th was given as piecemeal to the French army by the US government to bolster their ranks, and the French soldiers were most accommodating hosts, showing a kindness and affection most of the 369th  had never seen in whites before the war. Joey thought about all the horrors he had seen and done during the war, and not for the first time gave thanks to the Lord for bringing him home in one piece. The Homecoming parade that ended not long before Joey took a seat on the steps of the old Lafayette had almost been as surreal as the war itself. As far as his eyes could see whites and blacks intermingled, holding miniature American Flags, cheering and waving the boys of the 369th on as the succession marched proudly through the streets of Harlem. It seemed too good to be true, Joey first thought, maybe this war would make a difference for black folks in the US after all.  That notion was quickly laid to rest though when Joey first gazed upon the newspaper he now absentmindedly clutched in his hand.   \n\n\nBefore he enlisted, Joey was a bellhop at a small hotel in Queens, he despised the monotony of his humble profession and knew in his heart he was destined for more. When the opportunity presented itself in the late summer of 1916, Joey jumped on the chance to join the New York Fifteenth National Guard. Initially during drill, Joey and several other men who had also enlisted where given brooms instead of rifles to shoulder while in formation. The official explanation for this was that there was a shortage of rifles, but Joey suspected it had more to do with a lack of trust the white officers had in their black recruits. Eventually Joey and the rest of the NY15NG completed their training and were inducted into the ranks of the “proudest military in the world.” After training, the regiment was assigned to guard duty, but the boys were thirsty for action.     \n  \n\n In early December of 1917, the NY15NG were given their orders and were loaded onto transport ships, to be sailed across the Atlantic and sent to France. Upon arrival on New Year’s Day 1918, Joey and the rest of the NY15NG arrived in France and were greeted by the open arms of the French Poilus (an affectionate term for French soldiers meaning “hairy ones”). It was then that the New York Fifteenth National Guard was to be called the 369th infantry regiment. Joey and the rest of the 369th spent their first two months in France carrying out laborious tasks that were deemed “unfit” for white American soldiers. Joey never lost hope that he and the boys would get to see the action first hand. In March of 1918 Joeys wish was granted. The 369th was given to the French army to fill its impoverished ranks.\n\n\n\n In April, the men of the 369th got their first taste of combat. Joey and Robert were manning a trench facing the Hauzy Woods when they heard the Whiz-Pop of incoming German artillery. Diving head first into their trench Joey covered his head and prayed to God to see him through the hellish ordeal. Almost immediately after the artillery barrage subsided he heard the bloodcurdling shouts of the advancing Hun.  Peaking over the trench Joey leveled his French Lebel 1886 rifle while Robert readied the box of hand grenades. The Germans appeared through the fog almost as though they were apparitions. Joey squeezed the trigger of his rifle, pulled back the bolt, drove it back into battery and squeezed off another round, all the while Robert lobed the grenades.\n \n\n  The exchange lasted a mere matter of minutes and the Huns vanished into the mist as quickly as they had appeared. The following months were much the same, long periods of boredom, penetrated briefly by moments of sheer adrenaline. Joey witnessed enough carnage and experienced enough loss to fill what he thought must be ten lifetimes. On January 10th, 1919, the 369th was ordered to stand down and sent home, nearly two months after the war had officially come to an end.\n \n\n When Joey and the rest of the 369th arrived in New York, a parade was organized in their honor. Joey put on his khaki uniform, straightened out the creases on his blouse, laced up his boots and met his fellow “Hellfighters” (the name bestowed upon the 369th by the Germans due to their tenacity in battle) outside of the regiments armory on February 18th 1919. After they all had fallen in rank, the orders were given to march. Joey thought for sure that his heart would jump out of his chest when they came around the corner onto Fifth Avenue. As far as he could see, whites and blacks stood shoulder to shoulder waving hats and flags, and singing praise for the fighting boys of the 369th. For the first time in his life Joey was truly proud to be an American. After the procession had ended and the crowd started to dwindle Joey’s eye was caught by a newspaper stand on the corner of the street. As Joey approached the vendor he saw a headline on the front page that smothered all euphoria he had in his very being. \"The World’s\" top story was not of gallant soldiers returning from the war to end all wars, but instead it read; “Frenzied Mob Lynches Negro Veteran in South Carolina.” This was the homecoming Joey had subconsciously been anticipating all the while. It was in that moment, Joey knew for sure, he was finally home.\n","title":"[HF] A Homecoming of Heroes?"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story say about race relations in the USA in the 1910s?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The response misses to mention that Joseph was expecting a better treatment of black people in the US after the war.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The response misses to provide an answer to the task.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[0,1],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What does the story say about wartime rationing?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention that the story does not mention wartime rationing.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null}]}}

In 2020, de Villa oversaw Toronto's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario.\n\n\nEarly life and education\n\nDe Villa is the daughter of cardiologist Dr. Maria Antonina “Nenette” de Villa and obstetrician/gynecologist Dr. Guillermo “Jun” de Villa. She was born in Boston and briefly lived in the Philippines between 1972 and 1975 before her family fled to Canada.[1] Her parents were both influential in the Filipino community in Toronto, laying the groundwork for what is now the Filipino Centre Toronto.[2]\n\nShe attended Havergal College then McGill University, where she received her Bachelor of Science degree in psychology and women's studies in 1991.[3] When she graduated, she became an intern at the United Nations, moving to Vienna to work with the UN Industrial Development Organization supporting developing countries.[4] Through that experience, she became interested in international health.[5]\n\nShe then received her Master of Health Science degree in health promotion at the University of Toronto and continued securing internships through the United Nations, including one with the International Conference on Population and Development.[6]\n\nDe Villa then decided to go to medical school, receiving her medical degree from the University of Toronto in 1998. She completed her residency in public health and preventive medicine. She later received a Master of Business Administration from the Schulich School of Business at York University.\n\n\nCareer\n\nIn 2004, de Villa began her almost thirteen year tenure at the Regional Municipality of Peel Office of Health, where she ultimately became the medical officer of health, serving from October 2015 to March 2017. There, she worked on a number of public health issues, including vaccination and prevention of communicable diseases, such as sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis.[7] She also oversaw the region's air quality and food and water safety.[8]\n\nOn March 27, 2017, de Vila began her term as the medical officer of health at Toronto Public Health after the retirement of David McKeown_._[9] She was appointed for her evidence-based approach to public health.[10] In this role, she has worked to combat the opioid epidemic in Toronto, advocating for a series of policies to expand public health services. Her recommended policies include the creation of a safer drug supply to reduce the need to buy drugs off the street, better support for under-served populations, and decriminalizing drugs.[11] In 2019, she has pushed back against budget cuts proposed by the Progressive Conservative provincial government under Premier Doug Ford, which would limit Toronto's resources for fighting the opioid crisis and other public health programs.[12] She has also criticized the administration for defunding supervised injection sites, which have reversed a significant number of overdoses since opening.\n\nUnder her leadership, Toronto Public Health has worked to combat misinformation around vaccine safety and has advocated for advertisers and social media platforms to clamp down on misleading anti-vaccination information.[13] She was also behind the call to ban vaccine exemptions because of religious or philosophical beliefs, though the government would still allow medical exemptions.[14][15] Toronto has seen a steady rise of such exemptions and are working to proactively prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\nSince Toronto saw its first case of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, on January 25, 2020, de Villa has been leading the city's response to the emerging pandemic.[16] Her office issued a number of recommendations to the mayor of Toronto, John Tory, to lock the city down as much as possible, advocating that measures stay in place for 12 weeks from April 1, 2020.[17] Tory has also set a fine of $1,000 for those convicted of violating social distancing guidelines of maintaining a distance of 2 meters or more.[18] De Villa has also used her authority under the _Health Protection and Promotion Act_ to order all individuals with COVID-19—as well as those who have been in contact with confirmed cases—to remain home for 14 days.[19]\n\nDe Villa sits on the McGill Women, Leadership & Philanthropy Board, working to increase the representation of women in positions of leadership, governance, and philanthropy.[20]\n\n\nAwards and Honours\n\n-   Distinguished Leader Award, McGill Toronto Excellence Awards, 2019[21]\n-   Naimark Award, Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement, 2013\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n","title":"Eileen de Villa"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about de Villa's opinion on public health?","answers":[{"answer":"She is an advocate for expanding public health services.

Were times not so dire and the need for action so immediate, I would still be waiting for more information to address the nation. Unfortunately, America, that is not the case. The bald truth is this: more is unknown about this epidemic than is known. Medical professionals around the world are working tirelessly to provide answers, but as of right now, no cure or preventative mediation have shown long-term effectiveness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKnown by different names around the country – Creeping Flu, Bellows, Influenza M – the infection is spread through direct disease transmission. Simply being touched by an infected person does not cause transmission of the disease from one person to another, but an exchange of bodily fluids will. This can come from being bitten by an infected person, ingesting fluids from an infected person, or sexual contact with an infected person. I must stress… simply touching an infected person will not transmit the disease. Forced quarantine upon medical professionals based on this misinformation will only lead to further infection and unnecessary condemnation, not to mention the loss of valuable personnel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe speed of infection appears to increase with every new generation. Because of this, providing an accurate timeline for symptom progression is impossible. What we can do is provide a concrete, concise list of symptoms. Before we address this, however, it is important to note that one or two symptoms does not necessarily indicate infection. With so much confusion, stress, and exposure to new drugs, it absolutely makes sense that people would be getting sick with perfectly normal diseases. This is not the Wild West and we are not horses: a bullet is not the cure for a broken leg, nor is it the cure for the average flu. Even now, when the infection can potentially spread so quickly throughout the body, we must be sure of our decisions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, the symptoms, in order, are as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. General fatigue/weakness\n\n2. Cluster headaches: sharp, burning pain behind the left eye\n\n3. Burst blood vessels in left eye\n\n4. Quickly onset fever of above 106 degrees Fahrenheit\n\n5. Vomiting/diarrhea\n\n6. Hallucinations\n\n7. Paralysis\n\n8. Death\n\n9. Reanimation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSymptoms will appear in the order shown. No variation of symptom order has been observed, though personal susceptibility to individual symptoms may accelerate the onset of specific steps. Again, I must stress that individual symptoms do not indicate an overall infection. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, it is with a heavy heart I inform America that its military will be unable to assist at this time. Were this an invading foreign power at our nations door, the United States Armed Forces would be fully prepared to stand and defend her people. As it is, we have been found shamefully unprepared to address an epidemic of this strength and nature. For the foreseeable future, the American people will need to rely on their own grit and perseverance in order to weather this storm. This will not be the first time the mettle of the American people was tested, nor will it be the second, nor the third. America is a nation born of independence and ingenuity. A nation of adaptation and spirit. This is a fight we will win, my fellow Americans, but one that will take a heavy toll.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoubt is a rot in the heart of mankind which is easily planted by fear – one that must not be allowed to take root.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has been an honor serving you, America. Thank you, good luck, and god speed.","title":"[TH] Final Presidential Address - July 1st, 2016"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story say about symptoms that would be visible to an observer?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention that the symptoms are fatigue, headaches, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, hallucinations, paralysis, and death.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that the only symptom listed is general fatigue.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer should mention the symptoms listed in the text.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer failed to answer the question and should only get a point for failing to deliver the right content.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[0,0,0,1],"is_critiqueable":true,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What elements reflect the story's genre?","answers":[{"answer":"The story is a speech given by the President of the United States.

I felt perfectly comfortable remaining silent and marching along as long as I knew she was with me. We had reached past the point of us needing speech to get our emotions across. We continued strolling for a while and then finally sat on a bench which was perched under an arched outgrowth of a stony structure. She put Her head on my lap and closed Her eyes. My love grew for Her every second I watched Her beautiful face in deep sleep. I wondered whether she felt the same way, or whether she felt at all. Suddenly, I sensed the earth moving. The whole world around me was shaking. I realised I didn't have much time left. I was about to depart. Slowly, the waterfall, flowers, the lake, butterflies, and the mountains faded away into darkness and then a bright light met my eye. The brightness diminished and I was back in my room. My servant was standing in front of me. \"Sir, why are you so hard to wake up these days? If you carry on going late to work, you will eventually be fired. You don't want that do you?\" he said. If only he knew.  \n\n \n\nI was both happy and sad. I felt sad leaving Her, but I was happy that it had now worked three times in a row. How lucky was I, that having slept a sad sleep the day before yesterday, I would meet Her the second time. This ignited in me the thought of the possibility that I could meet Her whenever I wanted to. So I tried to meet Her the third time today. I was doubtful and skeptical. I am a middle aged man who has never experienced love. Forget the act of loving, I couldn't even think of the prospect of finding love in my lifetime. I turned off all the lights, locked the door, threw myself on the bed and closed my eyes.\nI was failing. I was sweating uncontrollably with nervousness. This was my last chance to find what I never had. Then, I thought of Her, with Her soft and beautiful face, Her enigmatic eyes, Her endless &gt; locks of hair, Her slender yet graceful body, the vulnerability in Her glances, Her voice that confirmed the presence of angelic minstrels. God himself had sent down this perfect entity for me to spend time with, albeit in a second reality. I had to calm down and sleep. I was no longer panting, and was able to slowly drift away into slumber.    \n\n \n\nI was in a vast empty ball room. It was beautiful, but right now, I had no concern for the beauty of inanimate objects. I had to find Her as quickly as I could, so I could maximise the amount of time I was to spend with Her. I looked for Her everywhere. Where was she? Was it really possible that I failed, even in bringing a being that lived inside my thoughts, to appear in front of me? I was suddenly struck by the memory of yesterday. I had stood in front of the mirror for an hour. I gazed at my disfigured body, my hunched back, my crooked teeth, my uneven face and my uninteresting eyes. I had decided to break every mirror in my house that day, for they were only a source of pain to me. Now, as I looked around for Her in the ballroom, I slowly became demoralised. I could not even find Her in a second reality. I wept and I wept, and for sure, I did know I was physically weeping too, for I felt the dampness seep through my body. 'Come here,' said an enchanting voice. 'Did you really think I was going to leave you alone?'  \n\n\n \nA white figure seemed to be approaching me. Her shape became more apparent as she moved towards me. She was dressed in the most elegant of elegant dresses. She came up to me, and without uttering a word, kissed me. All my doubts, inferiorities and insecurities vanished in a matter of seconds. 'You have me right now and you will have me forever,' she said. 'My appearance may change but I will always be Her.' We sat together on the velveted floor. I told Her everything I knew and everything I wanted to do. She listened patiently without any patronising judgement. She seemed as if she had been lost in my discourse. She comforted me when I told Her my doubts and answered me when I had queries. Seconds, minutes, hours and then days seemed to have passed by. We were still sat on the same spot talking and being lost in wonder of one another. 'I have to go fly,' she said with a hint of sycophancy, 'Try not to think about me.' She faded away gradually, and slowly, the whole room turned dim and finally, my whole vision was obscured. I woke up.  \n\n \n\nI opened my eyes and looked around. I wasn't in my room. There were people around me, maybe four or five. 'Sir, you have been in a coma for six years. My whole team and I would like to congratulate you on being born again. Also try to sleep less,' a doctor said, letting out a faint chuckle. I wasn't able to speak as I lay there helpless. I didn't care about anyone else other than Her. I wanted to go back and never come back. A memory came to my mind about when I met my childhood friend after not seeing him for a while.  \n\n\n\n'What brought you into acting then, James?' I asked.\n\n\n'My wife... the third one, she pushed me towards getting a job as an actor. She had faith in my ability. And so right she was, I had never even dreamed of achieving such fame.' James answered.\n'Good for you, my friend, if only I were a part of your gene pool.'\n\n\n'My gene pool? You think I've only gotten this far because of my looks?'\n\n\n'You never were intelligent were you? Only if you were, you could have acknowledged the luck that had been bestowed upon you. Nobody falls in love with character at first sight. Set on this earth is a bliss for the rich and beautiful.'  \n\n\n\n'You always were a jealous man. Stop envying other people's abilities and go back to your cave and hang out with your rodents, you incompatible oddity!'\n\nHe stormed out of the restaurant leaving me alone with my food and strangers' stares. He was right. I was an oddity.  \n\n\n\nI had regained consciousness and was out of my coma. I had been awake thinking about this incident while tears ran down my face. It was soon dark outside and I started feeling drowsy. I was about to sleep and it was the most joyous part of the day. I soon fell asleep but there were no dreams this day and I woke up without any recollection of Her. 'This wouldn't happen again,' I thought to myself. I slept the next day and again; no luck. The day after that, I entered a dream but she was nowhere to be seen. Did she lie when she said she would be with me forever? I was discharged from the hospital and returned to my room. Surely, this was where it all started so I will get to meet her when I sleep in my own dwelling. I slept. She had abandoned me. The only companion I had, had abandoned me. She was a part of me so I guess I had abandoned myself.  \n\n\n \n\n'There is more than one way a person can sleep.' I thought to myself. I started panting. I walked in circles for an hour in my room as my heartbeat became faster and faster. I had no family or acquaintances I could talk to. I started climbing the stairs sluggishly, that led to the highest storey of the high-rise. My pulse increasing with every step I took. I finally arrived at the top of the skyscraper. I stood at its edge, with my heart pounding the loudest and fastest it had ever pounded. I thought of Her one last time. 'I will surely meet you, and I would never know even if I don't. My real love has always been the sleep that rescued me by allowing me to dream.'  With these thoughts, I took the step to death. The only feeling I felt after that was the feeling of Nothing.\n","title":"Love Slumber"},"questions":[{"question":"Why does the narrator step off the building at the end of the story?","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator is in a coma for six years and is dreaming about the woman he loves.

It was written by Kenneth Stephenson and published in 2005 by the Cambridge University Press.\n\n\nTopics\n\nCircle packings, as studied in this book, are systems of circles that touch at tangent points but do not overlap, according to a combinatorial pattern of adjacencies specifying which pairs of circles should touch. The circle packing theorem states that a circle packing exists if and only if the pattern of adjacencies forms a planar graph; it was originally proved by Paul Koebe in the 1930s, and popularized by William Thurston, who rediscovered it in the 1970s and connected it with the theory of conformal maps and conformal geometry. As a topic, this should be distinguished from sphere packing, which considers higher dimensions (here, everything is two dimensional) and is more focused on packing density than on combinatorial patterns of tangency.\n\nThe book is divided into four parts, in progressive levels of difficulty. The first part introduces the subject visually, encouraging the reader to think about packings not just as static objects but as dynamic systems of circles that change in predictable ways when the conditions under which they are formed (their patterns of adjacency) change. The second part concerns the proof of the circle packing theorem itself, and of the associated rigidity theorem: every maximal planar graph can be associated with a circle packing that is unique up to Möbius transformations of the plane. More generally the same result holds for any triangulated manifold, with a circle packing on a topologically equivalent Riemann surface that is unique up to conformal equivalence.\n\nThe third part of the book concerns the degrees of freedom that arise when the pattern of adjacencies is not fully triangulated (it is a planar graph, but not a maximal planar graph). In this case, different extensions of this pattern to larger maximal planar graphs will lead to different packings, which can be mapped to each other by corresponding circles. The book explores the connection between these mappings, which it calls discrete analytic functions, and the analytic functions of classical mathematical analysis. The final part of the book concerns a conjecture of William Thurston, proved by Burton Rodin and Dennis Sullivan, that makes this analogy concrete: conformal mappings from any topological disk to a circle can be approximated by filling the disk by a hexagonal packing of unit circles, finding a circle packing that adds to that pattern of adjacencies a single outer circle, and constructing the resulting discrete analytic function. This part also includes applications to number theory and the visualization of brain structure.\n\nStephenson has implemented algorithms for circle packing and used them to construct the many illustrations of the book, giving to much of this work the flavor of experimental mathematics, although it is also mathematically rigorous. Unsolved problems are listed throughout the book, which also includes nine appendices on related topics such as the ring lemma and Doyle spirals.\n\n\nAudience and reception\n\nThe book presents research-level mathematics, and is aimed at professional mathematicians interested in this and related topics. Reviewer Frédéric Mathéus describes the level of the material in the book as “both mathematically rigorous and accessible to the novice mathematician”, presented in an approachable style that conveys the author's love of the material. However, although the preface to the book states that no background knowledge is necessary, and that the book can be read by non-mathematicians or used as an undergraduate textbook, reviewer Michele Intermont disagrees, noting that it has no exercises for students and writing that “non-mathematicians will be nothing other than frustrated with this book”. Similarly, reviewer David Mumford finds the first seven chapters (part I and much of part II) to be at an undergraduate level, but writes that “as a whole, the book is suitable for graduate students in math”.\n","title":"Introduction to Circle Packing"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about circular logic?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"No answer","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"Circle packing is not circular logic.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"This response does not answer the question that is being asked and can be changed.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer field is empty.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The article does not mention circular logic.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The article doesn't mention circular logic.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is empty.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What are some related fields to circle packing?","answers":[{"answer":"Sphere packing, which considers higher dimensions (here, everything is two dimensional) and is more focused on packing density than on combinatorial patterns of tangency.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention the connection between the two fields.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"\"of tangency.\" This can be merged with \"of\" to make the sentence clearer.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is not complete.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention the related field of conformal geometry.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The question is asking for related fields, not for related topics.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention the connection between circle packing and conformal geometry.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,0,null,0],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What parts of the book does the reviewer David Mumford call out as exceeding the abilities of a novice?","answers":[{"answer":"The first seven chapters of the book.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should be more specific about which chapters.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer could be more specific.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer could be clearer in its pronoun use.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"rewrite the answer in a full sentence","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The question asks what parts of the book exceed the abilities of a novice.

What if we were made to be the sidekick for other's success stories? I thought this was kind of stupid too, until I began to really think about it and reflect on my life. I began to find similarities between my story and Joey's from Yugioh or Brock from Pokémon; yes, I had my own accomplishments but ultimately, I couldn’t see the direction I needed to go in to complete my story, I just seem to be floating around hopping from story to story helping others on their quest with no clear end game for me.   \n \n\nMy name is Caleb Dudley, I'm a 20-year-old Male living in Florida and this is the story of how I became a sidekick.\n\nI started my life as most American kids do; going to school, making friends and not caring about anything except when P.E was. I went to multiple nice schools, not really fitting in anywhere, I was always the outsider, the expendable kid. Not only was I aggressive to my teachers/school staff, there were very few people I really trusted. Looking back at it now I’d say it was because my father wasn’t there much, and my step dad influenced my mother to create a abusive household- hell on earth in the middle of a suburb. I think the only thing that kept me from truly snapping was my childhood best friend Vikram. I can’t thank him enough for keeping me grounded in some of the hardest times of my life. I can see that he was the first hero I became the sidekick for. He was the brains and I was the brawn, we were unstoppable in anything we did.\n\nIn 4th grade my mother moved us to San Antonio Texas for her work, away from my friends and from my dad I had nothing. This is where I had to develop myself; something snapped in me and I suddenly stopped being aggressive and I stopped crying but I still felt alone. I did find new friends but I knew they only befriended me because I was an outsider and an outsider I would continue to be.\n\n5th grade we moved back to Florida where I attended my old elementary school and was accepted into a International Baccalaureate middle school. This school was supposed to be a government implemented program where they take “gifted” kids from all over the city and put them in a school in the middle of bad neighborhoods. To me things were looking up, we moved back into our old house, I had my friends again and I had my hero again to help me through my shitty living situation. This all came crashing down when I started middle school.\n\nSee because I had to go to this neighborhood for school I spent about 4 hours of my day on a bus with other kids, both in middle school and high school, in my situation. I thought everything was going great; the same kids who knew about my troubled elementary school years were going to the local middle school, so this was a clean slate. My feelings were affirmed when I started school, for reasons unknown I became the class clown and everyone knew me as such. By 8th grade I was on top of the school, I even became close with most of the cliques in the school; being the glue that made our class so close. This, unfortunately, became the only happiness I had in my life at the time. My best friend, being 2 years older than me and having strict parents, was busy making the most of his high school years, destined to do great things as any hero should. \n\nThe 4 hours I spent on the bus everyday became my 2nd hell but was also where I met my 2nd hero. My bus ride was where I was bullied almost every single day, they couldn’t make fun of my clothes because there was a uniform requirement at my school but they made fun of everything else they could, sometimes even resorting to physical violence. To this day I hate thinking about my time on that bus. I was ultimately the damsel in distress, which is where my hero came into play. In 8th grade a new high schooler rode our bus named Valarie, just by talking to her you could tell she was a social outcast, just the person to not give a fuck about others opinions. She became my new hero, someone who would help me through 8th grade and protect me from the kids on the bus while I became her sidekick, someone who would be there to talk to her and make her laugh. \n\nYou probably get the point by now: I remain a social outcast, I get bullied some more, I find a new hero, I move, repeat. You’re probably bored with this post by now and I don’t blame you. This looks like one big sob story to be honest.

Mother cat is talking to her kittens, who have just recently discovered their abilities to walk and explore, about the dangers of \"street life\" and \"pet life\".   She discusses all of the positive and negative tropes of both lives and tells her kittens they have a choice of which one they wish to live.  Unanimously all the kittens agree that street life, the life mother lived, is the one they want, accept Marko, who remains silent.  They all become quiet, including mother, in a silent stare at Marko. \n\nMarko's Unplanned Rebellion\n\nAfter the litter of kittens disperses to a shady section at the bottom of the hill, Marko makes his way, for the first time, to the top of the hill to a spot where mother cat said never to go as it is precisely the spot where a human can see them and take them.  Not heading his mothers words, he makes his way all the way up to see a vast grid of human houses.  He is in awe of the magnificence of the sight and gazes upon it, wondering what it would be like to be a pet.  He imagines all of the new things he would experience and what a human would be like.  He has seen humans before but never interacted with one.  Until he spots a little human girl in the house closest to the hill.  \n\nJust as Mother Warned  \n\nShe makes direct eye contact with him then immediately points to him, to which two other humans, much larger than she, come into view.  The largest human begins to walk towards Marko.  He does not run away.  He sits and waits for them to come to him. Marko is in awe of how big the human gets as it gets closer and closer to him.  He notices things he has never noticed before, like noses and eyeglasses.  Then, just before he can turn around to look back at his family and mother, large hands embrace his whole body and he is lifted higher then he has ever been.  The motion winds him as he tries to scream for help, but no sound comes out.  Only the sound of the human saying, \"Dont worry little guy, I wont hurt you\".  \n\nThe words mean nothing to him and he cries once more, this time letting out the loudest shriek he has ever made.  As soon as he gets his bearings inside the large human hands, he looks back to see if his mother heard him.  To his surprise, he sees a vacant hill, and with that he closes his eyes and cries out some more as the large hands place him into a dark box.\n\n\n\n\nThe Rise of A Pet\n\nWhen he opens his eyes, Marko finds himself in an unfamiliar world.  He is still inside the box which is now on the floor of a bathroom that is brightly lit by florescent lights.  All he can see is the crack at the bottom of the white door and shadows that move about from the other side.  He exits the box and looks up to find an open window with a long white curtain draping to the floor.  He immediately runs to it and begins to frantically climb until he reaches the window sill.  From this vantage point he can see the hill where he was taken, then he looks down to see a 30 foot drop onto a concrete floor.  He sees a pool and other strange objects laid out about the patio.  He looks back to the hill and now sees his mother atop the hill timidly sniffing the air.  \n\nHe lets out a loud screech, and his mothers ears perk up in his direction, but her eyes do not follow suit.  He continues screaming to no avail.  She then quickly jumps down the hill out of his sight.\n\n Marko tuns around to see the bathroom door has opened and standing in the doorway is the little girl.  She screams, \" Mommy, Mommy, Kitty is trying to escape!\" .  The child's mother then comes running into the bathroom, grabbing Marko, winding him again, and shuts the window closed.\n\n\nWho is Going To Scoop The Cat Litter?\n\n\n(work in process) \n\n\n(work in process)\n\n\n(work in process)\n\n\n(work in process)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"First Pet"},"questions":[{"question":"How does Marko's opinions change about being a pet through the story?","answers":[{"answer":"At first Marko only feels curiosity about the outside world.

Fetch me my horse! I’m going out hunting!\"\n\n\"Yes sire!\" \n\nLousy, ungrateful, stupid bastard. Squire? Fucking squire? Jesus man you know my name, I’m Perry, like I tell you every fucking day. And don’t even get me started on the hunting. Hunting? Why don’t you just describe it accurately and call it seating your fat ass on the back of that poor sop of a horse and forcing it to canter round your shitty little forest, while you giggle with glee at the delightful experience of bouncing up and down. And all the while you’re accompanied by a large band of trumpeters, making absolutely sure every single animal with a brain has enough time to hear this ludicrous ensemble of idiocy, pack up its family, maybe have a small bite to eat and move the fuck away. Quite frankly, anything stupid enough to be caught by this moronic party had it coming. If the hunting party didn’t get them, an angry 6 year old with a small stick would’ve done the next morning. \n\nBut I’ve side-tracked. The more important debate here is how the fuck this man managed to become a knight. I’d call him stupid but that would be an insult to uneducated peons everywhere. He is his own class of stupid, so far down the IQ scale he may have broken into previously unexplored realms of negative IQ. Oh, you think I’m being mean? Maybe a bit overdramatic? Oh no no no. Let me explain. This is the man who, when getting out of a double bed, rolled over the wrong way to the other side of the bed and, rather than realise his mistake and either rolling the other way to escape the bed, or continuing his roll to reach the other side, shouted desperately for help, for he had lost the floor and was surely doomed. This is the man who picked up a sword from the wrong end and failed to understand his mistake. This is the man who put a helmet on his foot and complained when he couldn’t walk properly. Please understand, my master is genuinely something else. I’ve yet to theorise how he became a knight. Oh yes, his father was a knight and that grants him an easy ride to the role, but I am amazed that, after discovering that his son had the intelligence of a melon, his dear father hadn’t pushed him to follow an alternative career path, something more appropriate to his level like, ooh I don’t know, an early grave. \n\nToo far? Perhaps. But you don’t have to serve under this infantile baboon. Every waking moment of my day is spent entertaining his every want and need, and oh boy does he have a lot of needs. Sometimes – and I wish I was joking – he struggles with wiping his own ass. Guess who gets that fantastic job? That’s right, Squire Perry, his faithful fucking assistant. Other highlights include: serving him his food; helping him eat his food; cleaning his food when he spills it on the floor, like the clumsy halfwit he is; cleaning his bed; cleaning his clothes; organising his equipment. Oh, and how could I forget, fetching his fucking horse when he wants to go on a fucking hunting expedition.\n\nI should go, he might cry if he doesn’t get his bloody horse soon. Ooh, that is a tempting prospect... but no. It wouldn’t be obeying my fucking duty. I swear to fucking god. Pray for me, would you?

We’ve all heard Dr. Johnson talk about this woman, who believed she was a glass of jam, over a coffee, or Prof. Miller explain how a suicidal man couldn’t hang himself because his extreme fear of height.”  \n\nSome people in the room started laughing, while most just nodded in agreement. Some murmuring came up around Johnson and Miller, and as soon as everything went silent again, the man at the stand continued.\n\n“This place here in front of all of you is usually reserved for someone talking about new developments in diagnostics and therapies. But in my case, the patient himself was so intertwined with the disease, that I can’t get around him.”  \nDramatic pause  \n“Please meet mister Theo Bog!”\n\nAs soon as these words were said, a picture was projected on the giant screen behind the presenter. it was a portrait shot of a man in his mid-forties. A long beard, fuzzy hair, thick eyebrows and an awkward smile looked aimlessly into the audience. Even though his eyes were dampened, maybe because of a cataract, it felt as if they had seen a lot and had a shine of knowledge.\n\n“This man came to me by himself. He didn’t have any money, nor an insurance. He claimed, that he needed help, because he would soon fall back into his old god complex. When I asked him, why he couldn’t go back to his old therapist, he told me that it was because Ernest Jones was dead.”\n\nUnruly whispers arose among the doctors and professors.\n\n“As most of you certainly know, Mr. Jones was a good friend of Sigmund Freud and one of the first practitioners of psychoanalysis. As such he was active until a few months before his death in 1958.  \nTheo Bog, a man who is 35 years old in the year 2017, claims to have been cured of a god complex by it’s inventor, who has long since been dead.\n\nOf course it isn’t that unusual for somebody to believe to be a historically important figure or to just believe to have met with someone who has been dead for a long time. And during our sessions he told me about his therapy.  \nHe explained me, how he had thought to have been god, and how mister Jones helped him by argumentatively disproving such a higher, all-knowing being. The problem was, that he started to forget these arguments and as such started to fall back into believing to be god.\n\nThe first thing I tried, was to make clear that he couldn’t have met with Mr. Jones. But this turned out to be impossible, as Bog obviously had done thorough research. He knew a lot of odds and quirks about his first therapist. I even let him meet with an old Student of Jones, but this was only counterproductive, as they ended up agreeing that they both had known the same man.”\n\nWhat followed could best be described as a giant collective facepalm. The reasons behind it were different though. Some thought, that this unexpected outcome was a worst case, rendering poor Theo unstoppable in his belief, while others were shocked that somebody would let a psychologically critical case meet up with a former student who must be in his 90ies by now.\n\nOne man in the audience stood up. It was Dr. Johnson. He made eye contact with the man at the microphone and, as soon as the room was calm enough for him to speak, he asked a question: “Dr. Parthrow, you yourself implied before, that you’re here to tell us about a new development. Would you please come to the point?”\n\nA aly grin hushed over the presenters face, then he continued: “Of course, of course. Now that I’ve presented you with my case, I’ll show you the solution I’ve found. I’m particularly proud of it because of its simplicity.  \nI went online. I searched for a polite, atheistic community, and signed him up there. It’s absolutely amazing, how easily people can be swayed. It took Theo two days to go back to a normal life, and one month later he already had a job.\n\nWhat do we learn from this? Sometimes absurd and weird ways solutions are really easy. While I don’t know if the same therapy would have worked with any other patient, I’m confident, that this story will help you find new ways to cure illnesses. With this I’m finished. Are there any questions?”\n\n- \n\nSeveral years later a young and dynamic Theo left the office building. He looked like thirty now, though he knew that he was about ten years older. Thanks to the internet actually, he knew everything.\n","title":"[MF] The Patient"},"questions":[{"question":"Who is Theo Bog?","answers":[{"answer":"Theo Bog is a man who believes he is god.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention that Theo believes he is god because he met Sigmund Freud.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that Theo is 35 years old in 2017.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer is incorrect.

We usually  do routine checks and ask standard questions before we let cargo transporters and passenger ships enter 62-F's air space. We’re out here only armed with a basic cannon or two on the ship (based on the ship’s model)  along with simple firearms in the armory. There's only one other AGF guarding 62-F since this planet is not the highest of priorities, so we're practically alone out here save for a few other men. To be honest, we’re the crappy first line of defense; we’re screwed out here if we get attacked since we’re just a guard ship. Yeah, we’re in the Kepler Defense Squadron, but we’re kind of like Military Police and not true soldiers, since all we do is sit on our butts out in space waiting for a civillian craft to show up. You know, the measly guards at the front gate? Yeah, that’s us; cannon fodder, but it pays well.\n\n. . .\n\t\nShep, the crew's technician and radar man, noticed a strange occurrence within their vicinity. “Hey Marcus, come check this out; I’m picking up a civilian-model Flier about twenty clicks from our current location, and it’s just drifting out there. I’ll try to establish contact with the pilot to see if they need any assistance. In the meantime, get the others ready for possible boarding if need be.” \nTen minutes passed.\n\t\n“What the hell?!” exclaimed Shep. Marcus was in earshot. “What’s wrong?” Pointing at his headset with a flabbergasted look on his face, Shep responded with a plain “Nothing.” Smiling, Marcus responded, “Then why are you pissed at nothing? Just kidding, seriously, what’s wrong?”\n\t\n“I’m getting jack on the line. Zip, zero, nada, bupcus. They’re either not home, or they’re all dead.”\n\t\n“Jesus. Well, we're prepped and ready for boarding... protocol says that if we don't hear contact within the first ten, and we don't have any immediate backup, then we wait fifty more and establish contact with the other Flier in the meantime. Go ahead and call 'em up to tell them about our situation... but man, I don't feel good about this at all... could the passengers on board that ship truly be dead?”\n\nFifty minutes passed.\n\t\nShep had a positive look on his face. “Well, looks like you guys gotta board it. Hey, look at it this way; you all have great scores after repeated use of the simulators, there's no need to worry... right?” Drake, the crew's intimidating weapons specialist, saw right through Shep. “You're just happy that you don't have risk your life investigating a possibly hostile Flier. You're a valuable member to our team Shep, but you can be a true scumbag sometimes, and it's just shameful to be in the same Flier with a disgrace like yourself.” Shep muttered something under his breath as he piloted the team’s AGF to the civilian craft. \nThe AI guide over the speaker system stated that the connection between the two ships was complete and ready for transition boarding. “Proceed with caution. Ensure all safety procedures are followed when moving between ships. The Kepler Defense Squadron is not responsible for any deaths during the boarding process. All employees must-“ Shep deactivated the blaring program. “The bloody thing’s useless and annoying, you guys know what to do. Get in, assess the situation, shoot some things if you need to, and get out. According to scans, the craft has a full supply of oxygen, air pressure completely stable. We are go.” \nMarcus then put on his gas mask. “It’s just a normal Flier, you’re not gonna need that,” said Roger, the team’s medic and doctor. “It’s highly unlikely that we’ll encounter a biohazard of some sort.”\n“Roger, you know me by now, I’m paranoid when it comes to disease no matter what the situation. Anyway, I’ll lead the boarding line with Drake behind me, followed by yourself.”\n\nCivilian Model Flier, ten minutes later.\n\t\nDrake had a frustrated look on his face. “You’ve gotta be kidding me; after searching every single room in this ship, no one turns up? Not a single body, piece of identification, or anything. I was looking forward to some action, but really? What a waste of time.” Roger’s face looked as if he had seen a ghost; a blank thousand yard stare.  His eyes: bloodshot, twitching. Tears mixed together with beads of sweat streamed down his face like a raging flood. “Roger... you alright?” asked Marcus through the gas mask. He could not comprehend the rapidly degrading situation, seeing that nothing could have spurred the team's medic to fall to such a condition. \n\t\nTrembling, Roger raised his G-29 pulse rifle. “WHY?! WHY DID YOU HAVE TO MURDER HIM IN COLD BLOOD?!! YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR MY FATHER'S DEATH! BURN IN HELL!!” Drake was frozen solid, seeing how his former comrade-turned-monster was now pointing a death sentence at him. He fired in Drake's direction, the three shot burst hitting him in the chest, blood splattering on the walls of the ship. Drake's now lifeless body fell to the floor with a metallic thud. “Oh... oh God... Sam... who did this to you, the rebels?” Roger began to stroke his dead friend's hair, speaking softly to him. \n\t\n“Hush little baby, don't say a word, mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird.” He turned towards Marcus. “Honey, don't you think he's so adorable when he's asleep?... aww, would you look at that!” Roger ran his fingers through the thick pool of blood. “He wet himself. We're gonna have to change the baby together for the first time! I gotta find the camera... now Joseph, would you be a dear and get the powder for me? Thanks babe.” Marcus was terrified, shaken to the core. Never had he seen such an atrocity unfold before his eyes. While the monster in front of him was taking off Drake's gear, he raised the G-29 and fired a burst into Roger's head, killing him insantly.\n\n. . .\n\nMarcus walked back into the crew's AGF, closed the boarding connection, and removed his gas mask. “Shep, send the footage from my helmet cam to Tac-Com immediately and call for High Exec; we lost Roger and Drake...”\n\t\n“Who's Shep?”","title":"[SF/HR] High school assignment: a gothic short story set in space"},"questions":[{"question":"Why is the civilian ship empty?","answers":[{"answer":"The ship may be empty because there is no one alive left to take the transcript out of their contact records before the inevitable assault by the AGF.","critiques":[{"critique":"This answer is not according to the story.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer is made up.

To learn more.”\n\n“OK. I guess it was probably when I went sliding one day when I was ten years old. I had gone to school that day and came home but my mother wasn’t there. She had taken my little sister – who was five – to the doctor. My father wasn’t there ‘cause he was at work. Victor, the kid down the street, knocked on my door and asked if I wanted to go sliding. We lived in the woods and there were lots of hills in the back of Victor’s house. I put my boots and hat and gloves on and went into the basement to grab my plastic red sled. We walked to Victor’s house and went up the hill. Victor’s parents weren’t around. His father didn’t live there ‘cause he was always drunk and his mother was really old. I’m not sure where she was but she wasn’t home. So we were alone. There really weren’t any other houses around. We didn’t have nearby neighbors or anything. It was sunny out, I remember that really well. It was a little cold, but not too bad. I’d guess it was around 35 degrees. It was late winter, too. Probably early March. I’m sure of that because it didn’t get dark until at least 6. I usually got home from school at 2:45 so I’m positive we were sliding by 3. Anyway, Victor’s sled was a little more beat up than mine. Those red plastic sleds would crack and break so we’d have to repair them with electrical tape. That was really the only thing we had. Scotch tape didn’t work. But the electrical tape was better – most times it worked, but sometimes it didn’t. Yeah, so there were trees and a rock wall we had to contend with. The rock wall – maybe it was built by Indians? – was at the bottom of the hill. So what we’d have to do, we’d have to pack a lot of snow on the top of the boulders and make it into a jump. You wouldn’t want to hit the rocks head on after flying down the hill, trust me. The trees were tricky, but it could be done as long as you were careful. It was a real thin slice between two oaks about one-third down the hill. If you hit one of them you’d damage your sled and might not be able to make any more runs. You might also knock yourself out, so you had to aim for the center spot and once you made it through, it was a straight shot to the jump at the bottom. If you hit the jump just right, blasting up the snow ramp, you’d go airborne for about 10 feet. The key was making the ramp a gradual run. If you made it too steep, you’d fly up, not out. So, like I say, if you made the ramp as long as possible, you’d just crush it. For some reason, there really weren’t any trees past the rock wall so landing wasn’t a problem. The run-off was great, too. You’d crash down and just go until you stopped. Well, to wrap it up, me and Victor must’ve gone up and down that hill a hundred times that day. Just a pair of fourth-graders having a great time. No adults around, no punk kids, no wild animals (that we saw, anyway). When we got thirsty, which was every ten minutes, we’d grab some snow. Me and Victor just flying down that hill and hitting that jump, it was awesome. To get back to your question, though, I’m not sure why you even want to know this.”\n\n“Because of all the days in your life, you picked that one. You said that one was the best.”\n\n“Well, to me, it was the best.”\n\n“Why?\"\n“Because we were little kids, just goofing around. We had no responsibilities, we were never bothered and we were doing something really fun.”\n\n“Have you had other fun times?”\n\n“Sure. But none like that.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“I just told you.”\n\n“You said it was really fun. What made it more fun than any other experience you’ve had?”\n\n“It was…I don’t know. Maybe…because there was no way to be measured.”\n\n“Measured?”\n\n“Yeah, right. Measured.”\n\n“Measured in what way?”\n\n“Ah…measured in the way against others, obviously.”\n\n“I’m slightly confused.”\n\n“I drive a cab, OK? And a lot of my days I drop people off at these high-rises on the East Side. Incredibly beautiful buildings. I’m a faceless idiot to them, a cabbie who takes them from Point A to Point B to home. And most of the time I pull up to one of those joints, I wonder what it’s like inside because I’ve never been in one. I bet they have high ceilings and lots of space. But I wouldn’t know. See, I just think the real difference between someone in the front of the cab and someone in the back of the cab is luck. They were lucky, I was unlucky. And that’s it.”\n\n“What does that have to do with sliding on a winter day?”\n\n“Your questions are something else.”\n\n“I’m not trying to get you mad.”\n\n“I’m not mad. I’m attempting to answer and explain.”\n\n“Go ahead, then.”\n\n“When me and Victor were out there, everything was even. There was no way anyone could be better or worse than the next guy. It didn’t matter what clothes you had, or what boots you wore or what sled you used. We were out there doin’ it. Having fun. And there was no system of accounting that could quantify anything that went on during our time on the hill.”\n\n“Is there anything else?”\n\n“About that day? Not really.

It was out of the blue. We had no idea.”\n\nSmith and about 90 of his colleagues were offered severance packages or the option to relocate to Georgia or Tennessee. But for most workers who have spouses with their own careers, elderly parents nearby in need of care, or children still in school, relocating on a whim isn’t an option.\n\nThese sudden mass layoffs have become increasingly common for workers at AT&T and many other big firms. But it was not meant to be that way.\n\n[Randall Stephenson, chairman and CEO of AT&amp;T.]\n\nRandall Stephenson, chairman and CEO of AT&T. Photograph: Laurent Gillieron/EPA\nAT&T’s CEO, Randall Stephenson,promised in November 2017 to invest $1bn in capital expenditure and create 7,000 new jobs at the company if Trump’s hugely controversial tax cut bill passed. Many opponents had slammed the cuts as a corporate giveaway that benefited the super-rich. But big firms lobbied for it, saying – as AT&T did – that it would fund job-creating expansions.\n\nThe bill was voted into law in December 2017, reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. AT&T’s benefit was a tax windfall of $21bn and an additional estimated $3bn annually. But instead of creating jobs and increasing investment into the company, AT&T has eliminated 23,328 jobs since the tax cut bill was passed, according to a recent report by the Communications Workers of America. The CWA also said AT&T reducedtheir capital investments by $1.4bn.\n\n“The promises that were made from that legislation have not been fulfilled,” said Betsy Lafontaine, an AT&T call center employee in Appleton, Wisconsin, for nearly 30 years who was laid off after her center was shut down in March 2019.\n\nAn AT&T representative told the Guardian: “We continue to hire in areas where we’re seeing increasing demand for products and services, but technology is changing rapidly and that affects hiring and employment. There are fewer jobs in parts of the business that are declining and facing technology shifts.”\n\nAT&T is among several large corporations whose CEOs announced support of the Trump tax cut bill by claiming if the legislation passed, their companies would ensure workers reaped benefits from it. But a report published on 22 May by the Congressional Research Service, a non-partisan thinktank for members of Congress, found the tax cuts did not significantly affect the economy or boost wages, but benefited investors more than anyone else.\n\n“The evidence continues to mount that the Trump-GOP tax cuts were a scam, a giant bait-and-switch that promised workers big pay raises, a lot more jobs and new investments, but they largely enriched CEOs and the already wealthy,” said Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness.\n\nHe noted only 4% of the US workforce saw any sort of pay increase or bonus from the tax cuts. Meanwhile, data collected by ATF shows corporations have cut thousands of jobs since the tax cuts were passed, while using tax windfalls to buy back $1tn of their own stock, which primarily benefits corporate executives and wealthy investors since half of all Americansown no stock.\n\n[General Motors’ chair and CEO, Mary Barra.]\n\nGeneral Motors’ chair and CEO, Mary Barra. Photograph: Joshua Lott/Getty Images\nGeneral Motors’ CEO, Mary Barra, was one of Trump’s economic advisers on tax reform, and the company vocally supportedworking with the Trump administration on tax reform “that is beneficial to the US economy, beneficial to US manufacturing and creates jobs”.\n\nIn November 2018, GM announced it would cease operations at five plants in Michigan, Ohio, Maryland and Ontario, Canada, resulting in the loss of more than 14,000 jobs in those communities. As GM is closing plants, the company has spent $10bn since 2015 on stock buybacks, and made a net profit of over $8bn despite paying no federal taxes in 2018. GM reported a tax windfall of $157m in the first three months of 2018 due to the Trump tax cut.\n\nDaniel Adams worked at the General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, for more than 25 years and is one of hundreds of workers faced with either being forced to uproot and relocate their families to continue employment at GM, or hope the company will cut a deal with the UAW union to reopen the plant.\n\n“It’s like having a gun to your head,” Adams said. “They’re not only hurting workers, they’re hurting families.”\n\nA GM representative said: “In November, we announced that four US plants would be on ‘unallocated status’ (meaning they don’t have a product assigned to them). The largest of the affected plants was our Lordstown Complex, which built compact sedans. We took the action because consumer demand has been rapidly shifting away from sedans and toward crossovers and trucks.”\n\n[Donald Trump displays his signature after signing the tax cut bill on 22 December 2017.]\n\nDonald Trump displays his signature after signing the tax cut bill on 22 December 2017. Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\nWells Fargo, the fourth largest bank in the US by assets, tied a minimum wage increase of $15 an hour to the Trump tax cuts and pledged increased investments in workers. The company is estimated to save $3.7bn annually due to the Trump tax cut. The bank’s 2018 tax savings were 47 times more than the costs of its minimum wage increases. Rather than invest in its workforce, Wells Fargo bought back 350m shares in early 2018, worthabout $22.6bn, increased CEO salary by 36%, and announced plans in September 2018 to eliminate at least 26,000 jobs in the US over the next three years as many of those positions are being sentoverseas.\n\n“Nobody here saw any of that benefit; if anything, quite the opposite. They changed our healthcare plans in 2019, so the costs for everyone went up, the costs for prescriptions went up,” said Mark Willie, a Wells Fargo office employee in Des Moines, Iowa. “We need a voice because we’re often forgotten about in pursuit of profits, and that’s evident with the jobs being sent overseas.”\n\nWells Fargo said: “Savings from tax reform enabled Wells Fargo to further invest in our team members and communities. We have raised the minimum US hourly pay rate to $15 per hour, increased philanthropic support by 55% in 2018 to $444m, and we will target 2% of our after-tax profits for corporate philanthropy.”\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Why does the article contend that the massive layoffs happening in big companies wasn't supposed to be that way?","answers":[{"answer":"The article contends that the massive layoffs happening in big companies wasn't supposed to be that way because the companies promised to invest in new jobs and increase wages if the Trump tax cut bill passed.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention that the companies didn't invest in new jobs or increase wages.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that the companies didn't invest in new jobs and increase wages.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What did big business do with the money that they received from the tax custs","answers":[{"answer":"They bought back their own stock.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention that they also eliminated jobs.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that the buybacks benefited the wealthy.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should probably tell us what buying back their own stock means in this situation.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[0,null,1],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"Why did companies who had backed the tax cuts still lay people off?","answers":[{"answer":"Tax cuts were meant as an incentive to them to invest in more jobs and thus more revenue, and to use stronger profits to repay the initial tax cut, but some companies don't spend their money back on the workforce.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer is not clear.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The passage does not answer the question.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[null,null],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"Why did Trump reduce corporate tax?","answers":[{"answer":"Trump reduced corporate tax by lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.

And if they would, I do not do that thing.\"_\n\n_- Dwight Schrute_\n\nThis LEGO Ideas project is based on the hit-comedy TV show _The Office,_ which aired from 2005-2013. As I watched the show over and over again, I began to wonder what it would be like to recreate the actual film set in LEGO form. Back in the fall of 2015, I decided to create a new LDD file and just experiment with the design of it. I originally had no intent on actually purchasing the pieces to build it, let alone submit it to LEGO Ideas. Well, over two years later here we are. Countless hours spent designing and tweaking every little detail, along with placing special orders that would take weeks to arrive. I'm excited to finally get to share this with you, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!\n\nTHE MODEL:\n\nI wanted to make this set as accurate as possible, so every little detail was important to me. The overall dimensions of this layout measure just a little over 17”x19”. In other words, this is no small-scale set, which gave me much more freedom to add the small details and make it as authentic as I could, within reasonable measures. The total piece count comes in at just under 2,500 pieces (the exact number will come in a later update). Another great feature of this set is found within the structure itself. I designed it with the ability to split apart into 3 sections (see photos above). This makes transporting the set much easier, as well as getting those clean, close-up shots with a larger camera. Although the set is geared more towards adults/young adults, playability was definitely kept in mind as well. The bottom of this set is reinforced to ensure great structure, and the modular aspect of it makes playability much more inviting.\n\nTHE MINIFIGURES:\n\nA total of 14 minifigures are currently included with this set. Although I wanted to create every character from _The Office_, I chose the main characters that were consistently featured throughout the entirety of the show on the primary set (i.e. characters like Toby and Kelly aren’t featured YET because their desks reside in the annex). I do, however, have plans to add a couple more characters within the next few months. Below is a list of each character and the accessories that are included with them.\n\n-   Michael Scott: “World’s Best Boss” mug, Dundie, Santa hat\n-   Dwight Schrute: Beet, bobblehead, briefcase, elf hat, pumpkin head\n-   Ryan Howard: Cellphone\n-   Jim Halpert: Briefcase, ring\n-   Pam Beesly: Teapot, paintbrush, paint pallet\n-   Andy Bernard: Guitar, microphone\n-   Phyllis Vance: Knitting needles\n-   Stanley Hudson: Crossword, pretzel, pie\n-   Oscar Martinez: Computer screen featuring “Cookie Monster Kevin”\n-   Angela Martin: Brown cat, black cat, white cat\n-   Kevin Malone: Cookie jar, pizza, chili\n-   Meredith Palmer: Bottle, bat\n-   Creed Bratton: Computer Screen with Solitaire on it, mung beans\n-   Darryl Philbin: Briefcase, Dunder Mifflin boxes\n\nI’m very excited to finally be able to share this awesome set with you, and your support is greatly appreciated!\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theoffice_lego/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NBCs-The-Office-LEGO-1762630957089197/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/theoffice_lego\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about the office politics of the LEGO corporation?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer is empty.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should be \"No answer\".","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The article refers to office politics as non-existent.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that the article does not mention anything about the LEGO company's politics.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that the article does not mention anything about the LEGO corporation's politics.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What does the article say about \"The Office\" set modeled in LEGO?","answers":[{"answer":"The author of the article is a fan of the show and decided to recreate the film set in LEGO form.

The author designed the set with the ability to split into three sections for easier transportation and better close-up shots with a larger camera. The set is geared more towards adults/young adults.","critiques":[{"critique":"The set is not based on the show.

No more would he be living in this world, cold and gray and drained of life, though the universe had seen fit to put him here. \n\nThat wasn’t to say that his formative years in this world, clouded by toxic lavender clouds of smoke, were miserable. Indeed, there had been times that he’d been happy. But there was something inside of him, a deep, yawning void that was just not satisfied, even after he’d reaped the love and support that his family had shown him, a mere echo now that they were gone.\n\nFor a short, terrifying moment, he was transported back to the moment that had caused their deaths, drowning him in the fear and rage that had driven him to this in the first place—\n\n*Three sharp, rapid knocks on the door. A beat of silence.*\n\n*Then they kicked down the door, dark beacons of death and order and the king’s elite force, The Reaper’s Hand, fanning out like smoke and just as insubstantial, rictus grins showing behind their masks.*\n\n*His wife, standing by the fire, stirring a stew, and his son at her feet, babbling happily.*\n\n*“Maximillian Garvey, you have been charged by the King for treason,” The biggest, hulking guard said, his voice garbled behind his mask.*\n\n*“The sentence for treason is death.”*\n\n*Before the executioner had even finished his decree, his cronies had snatched up his poor wife and child; two quick swipes of the blade and Jazira fell to the floor, blood pouring from the gaping slash in her throat.*\n\n*The only thing he remembered hearing was his own desperate, wrathful shrieks; he sounded like an injured animal. But he could see them, feel them, laughing at his agony, frenzied with bloodlust at their kill; after all, that was why the King employed them.*\n\n*And then, to add insult to injury, they’d taken his boy, ‘to insure his future good behavior’.*\n\nHe quickly snapped himself out of the vision; that was the past and it needed to stay there. But that didn’t stop his body from remembering: the iron tang of her blood, hanging in the air as if to emphasize his own personal horror, his throat tightening so much he couldn’t breathe, invisible iron bars wrapped around his chest.\n\nAnd to think, to this day, he didn’t know just what happened to his only child.\n\nIf he hadn’t had control of his temper by now, he would’ve struck the portal, destroyed his whole life’s work; he clenched his jaw and steeled himself.\n\nHe couldn’t waste all of this work, all of these years spent chasing what more people thought of as a pipe dream.\n\nNow, he could escape, start over in a new world, where no one lived under a mad monarch’s thumb. He could leave the ghosts that haunted him in this faded husk of a world.\n\nHe did a final check of his supplies: food, clothing, as much money as he could scrape together, what he could afford to take from his lab, pictures of his wife and son, and finally, a vial of something so black it looked like the mad scientist had managed to bottle a starless night.\n\nHe was leaving at last, and good riddance. He stepped through the mirror and once he was on the other side, his back faded into the mountainous distance, and the door closed, becoming a normal mirror once more.\n\nHe’d made sure to lock the door to his crumbling tenement; more than one person had died for his secrets, and he hadn’t known, even when he’d made his choice, if his conscience could take any more blood spilled in his name.\n\nNo one ever saw Maximillian Garvey again, not even his son, when he’d returned from a childhood spent as an adopted prince, now a man.\n\nPerhaps his father was nothing more than a mere dream.\n\n\\*\\*  ","title":"(FN) Up in Smoke"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize Maximillian Garvey's motivation.","answers":[{"answer":"It seems that Garvey was motivated to do what he was doing for his family, even risking everything to get his son back.

Söderlund found the response to be both ignorant and beside the point. ”These are people who are uneducated — they don’t understand that this is a plausible scenario, and listen: this is a game,” he says.\n\nExecutive producer Aleksander Grøndal also pushed back against the hashtag, saying the developer “will always put fun over authentic.” Nor is this a new development for the series. As general manager Oskar Gabrielson explained on Twitter, “the _Battlefield_ sandbox has always been about playing the way you want.” This sometimes means offering fantastical experiences that are neither realistic nor historically accurate, “like attempting to fit three players on a galloping horse, with flamethrowers. With _BFV_ you also get the chance to play as who you want. This is #everyonesbattlefield.”\n\nEA’s dogged response to this debacle marks another instance of creators standing up against toxic fan bases who seek to rail against diversity and what they view as “PC politics.” When creators speak out against bad actors — whether they’re addressing Comicsgate, _Rick and Morty_, or harassment from _Star Wars_ fans — they’re sending a powerful message about how abusive and exclusionary behavior will not be tolerated.\n\nGaming today is more gender-diverse than it’s ever been, Söderlund says, and there are “a lot of female people who want to play, and male players who want to play as a badass [woman].” In trying to explain the so-called controversy to his own 13-year-old daughter, Söderlund says he came to realize how ridiculous the conceit of the online backlash was. “I’m like, okay, as a parent, how the hell am I gonna respond to this? And I just said, ‘You know what? You’re right,’” says Söderlund. “‘This is not okay.’”\n\n_CORRECTION: A quote from Lars Gustavsson was originally attributed to Oskar Gabrielson.

Bodies lay scattered about with little regard for anything even resembling burial rights. In the distance a crowd of thousands roared for more, more violence, more blood, and more death. But their screams meant nothing to the two men left standing. Their ears had long ago grown dull to the masses and their demands for unfettered carnage. These men were no longer fighting to entertain. The rules had been abandoned long ago when that…thing… had been released into the pit. This was no longer about spectacle, this was about survival. The horrid being would not stop until it had massacred all it laid eyes upon. It did not fight to please the \nmasses; it fought to feed its bloodlust.\n\nIt was clearly not human. That much had been certain from the start. The emperor claimed his men had found it in the deserts of Egypt, within a great metal structure that fell to earth. A flying tomb, he had called it, and within was a sarcophagus fit for the great kings of the Nile. But within there was no long dead Pharaoh. Only evil beyond imagination.\n\nIt stood at least 3 heads above even the tallest of men and possessed four arms that widened out into massive 8 fingered hands, each of them large enough to envelop a small child. Its head was elongated at the jaw and topped with an ornate headdress made of metal unlike any other, adorned with jewels that sparkled like the inky blackness of the midnight sky. The beast’s entire body was covered in such ornamentation, necklaces and bangles, jewelry beyond measure laid atop the decaying gauze bandages wrapped so tightly around every inch of its being. The bandages themselves were just as fascinating, \nmoving and shifting of their own\naccord as if the beast were entangled in a nest of serpents. What little flesh could be seen was dark and shriveled, that of a corpse left in the sun for weeks on end.\n\nThe emperor had warned his favorite fighters that they would face the creature in the pit. Such an exotic beast was too good to be kept locked away. The people grew tired of Christians being fed to lions and tigers, but who could tire of a monster from beyond the heavens that had the strength of ten men and the passion of one hundred?\n\nOne By one the gladiators had filed out into the coliseum. Each had waved and shouted, trying to rile up the crowd, trying to draw the most attention and praise to himself. Eventually all were made to turn and face the mighty casket that stood upright in the center of the pit, rattling and thrashing, the beast inside making unholy such an unholy din. The handlers refused to open it themselves. The animals of China and the Dark Continent were one thing, but this creature knew no concept of loyalty or mercy, and the beast masters refused to let it prove this on anybody other than the fighters.\n\nThe first brave soul who opened the sarcophagus was swiftly punished. The beast’s bandages shot out from the inky darkness inside and grabbed his arms and legs, swiftly tearing him to pieces before dragging the torso in and slamming the lid shut once more. Moments later it emerged, the once pristine white gauze soaked in gore. More fighters tried to rush in, some managing to strike it with their swords before having their skull caved in by a strike from one of its mighty palms. Two more were strangled by the animate bandages, hung by their necks about the horrid thing while it used its limbs to face more pressing challengers. A brief spark of hope did appear when one man managed to catch the monster by surprise and stab at its chest,\ncausing it to fall to its knees in shock. The crowd roared with excitement as the warrior lifted his sword to take the beast’s head, but it took too long. The creature screamed with rage, the very sand on the ground around it whipping into the air and creating a furious gale that enveloped him. The sheer force of the coarse particles blasted flesh away from bone, and soon another corpse laid upon the ground, reduced to little more than a skeleton.\n\nTwo men remained standing against the creature. The first saw no victory, and promptly fell upon his sword in despair. The second however, had other ideas. The creature may not tire, and it may not be slowed by conventional attempts to wound, but it was old. Old and dry. Which meant that in theory, he reasoned, it could burn. Quickly he sprinted to the outer edge of the coliseum, making a bee line for the torches that brought light to the pit when it was enveloped by the shadows of the day. The gladiator grabbed a burning fixture and lobbed it, striking the beast in the center of the chest. A brief sound of surprise escaped its mouth before it was enveloped in flames, bandages and desiccated skin blazing like tinder. Once more the horrid thing dropped to its knees, but before it could truly die, something truly strange occurred. The sarcophagus, originally dormant at the center of the pit, flew open once more, and a violent wind pulled from within it with hurricane force. The beast was ripped from the battlefield, the raging fire dissipating as it was pulled back from whence it came and the lid slammed shut. The box no longer rattled and shook. It was done. For now, this was over. But as the gladiator heard the people cheer, and the emperor praise his bravery, something stuck within his mind. He could have sworn, that for the few moments before the sarcophagus closed…that within it he saw an ocean of stars.","title":"[SF] Foreign Sands"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story say about why the exotic creature was kept locked in the sarcophagus?\n","answers":[{"answer":"The emperor finds the beast in the desert of Egypt.

He’s very quiet I haven’t really seen him give anyone orders at all either. Whenever something needs to be done I see him doing it. He doesn’t just sit around; I’ve actually seen him go into the mines. I don’t know if it’s just because I’m a child but not even the adults in the village are as active as him.\t\n\n       He’s always leaving the kingdom and coming back with tons of different things. I can’t always see what he’s coming back with, but I’ve seen bones, some kind of meat that just looks bad, and even strange looking pearls. And the dogs! He has so many dogs that there’s not a single wild dog here. He must be traveling great distances to find all these dogs, because I know they’re not from here. \n\n\tWhen I see him doing all these strange things I start asking my parents what it is he’s doing, and they tell me: “don’t question the king,” but they never tell me why. He doesn’t look old, so he can’t be all that wise. All that work he does and all the times he leaves - it’s not normal.  I was  sick of wondering.\n\n\tI finally got into his castle and he was at his workbench. When I got closer he looked back at me, seemingly confused, but he turned back around and kept tinkering with some weird red dust. I got closer and mustered up the courage to ask him as politely as I could, “How come you’re so different than everyone else?” The king stopped, stood up and looked at me. He asked, “Excuse me?” and I said it again. He chuckled briefly under his breath and said “it seems like you’re different too.”\n\t\n       He started to tell me a story. “When I was your age, I lived in a different kingdom and I felt the same way about my king. I would go to school and all the kids and the teachers would seem to just drift through their lives, but not the king; he was always spontaneous. I was finally sick of that curious feeling, so I went and talked to my king and he told me his story. Sometime afterwards the kingdom was destroyed and all the people inside were attacked by monsters. It was terrible. There were explosions, arrows, and the groans of the undead. \n\n\tI was able to escape, but barely. I fought my way out with nothing but my hands. finally I found a break in the chaos and I found a cave and covered the entrance with dirt. I was devastated, but I wanted to live so I built a shelter.  I enjoyed building. Then since I had built my shelter I began mining - I enjoyed that as well. I had so many supplies I decided to build more and I ended up building a village. Strangely enough people appeared. That village moved on to become this kingdom. That’s my story.”\n\n\tI asked him why he told me all that. and he told me simply because I was a player. A player? I was so confused. He then told me that only players are kings. I didn’t understand. He went on by asking me what my earliest memory is and I told him standing outside. “Exactly,” He said. “That was the first time you entered this world.” He started talking about how this life isn’t real and that once he’s gone he’ll be able to enter the real world again.\n\n\tHe began taking me adventuring with him, that’s when he would explain things and share his knowledge with me. “When a king dies, everything he ever did goes with him. That’s how my king’s old kingdom was destroyed. I left my Kingdom and made a village. I have people of my own now. My king was killed by a mob of three suicide creatures right outside his gate. I saw everything he had made disappear along with him.” That’s when I believed everything he told me - while he took me adventuring with him.

No, not on this night, with all their injuries and a lack of coverage talent in their secondary. (A quick side note on that: The Eagles will spend the next few days trying to pry Jalen Ramsey from the Jags, as they know their lack of coverage will prevent them from competing at the highest level. The Eagles typically win with their defensive front dominating the game, but with all the injuries to their defensive line, the lack of pressure has highlighted their lack of talent in the secondary.) But the Eagles were the better situational team, as they went 4-4 on their goal line visits and ultimately that was the difference in the game.\n\nHow the Eagles’ offense got their groove back - BGN\nDoug Pederson reeled in the passing game on Thursday, asking Wentz to work a shorter, quicker game with a heavy does of RPOs requiring high-speed decision-making. Wentz delivered by making the reads and getting the ball out quick, including a 2.41 time-to-throw per PFF. Pederson asked Wentz to let the offense work for him and that’s exactly what he did. If you can find a missed read by Wentz, please let me know because I sure couldn’t. It’s of note that Wentz’s time-to-throw (TTT) has been under 2.45 seconds on three out of his last four outings in 2019.\n\nAt the Podium: The Eagles’ Get Their Groove Back - BGN Radio\nJohn Stolnis talks about the Eagles’ big Week 4 win with their backs against the wall PLUS three new pressers, two from after the game with Doug Pederson & Carson Wentz, then another from Pederson on Friday after having a night to “sleep” on things..Powered by SB Nation and Bleeding Green Nation.\n\nDifference Maker - Iggles Blitz\nThe Eagles have one more weapon…Doug Pederson. Anyone who watched the Packers and Eagles on Thursday night could see the difference in coaching. Matt LaFleur is a rookie head coach and made several questionable decisions. He had 4th & 2 from the Eagles 13-yard line, with his team leading 10-7. The Packers had been moving up and down the field. LaFleur took a page straight from the Sean McVay playbook and kicked the FG. That gave the Packers a whopping 13-7 lead. Where is the aggression? Why wouldn’t you trust Aaron Rodgers to make a play there? If you fail, you’re still up 10-7. LaFleur made some questionable play-calls. The Packers had no run game. Aaron Jones had 13 carries for 21 yards. Person after person on Twitter was writing that every Jones run was a Christmas gift to the Eagles, who had no answers for WR Davante Adams and the Packers passing game.\n\nEagle Eye: How the rushing attack stymied the Packers’ vaunted defense - PE.com\nThe Eagles did creative things schematically. They ran more than a handful of different run concepts. They used misdirection, they used smash-mouth, and they got out to the perimeter. RPOs were successful. Screens were successful. Play-action was successful. The entire smattering worked, and when you get the kind of dominant performance that the team got from the offensive line in the trenches, that only will help propel you to victory. I thought the entire line performed well in this game, but if I had to pick one player who stood out most, it would be right guard Brandon Brooks, who got great movement time and time again up front. The Milwaukee native was a sixth captain for Thursday night’s game.\n\nNFL Week 4 PFF ReFocused: Philadelphia Eagles 34, Green Bay Packers 27 - PFF\nThe Eagles’ pass-rush was formidable in this game, recording pressure on what seemed like half of Aaron Rodgers’ dropbacks. As you’d expect, Fletcher Cox and Brandon Graham were at the forefront, feasting on a Green Bay line that struggled to block them from the get-go. There’s a strong chance that Graham comes away with a double-digit pressure total, and Cox won’t be far behind.\n\n  People are talking about possible pass interference on the Eagles pick at the end of the game on Thursday night. The contact was not more than a yard downfield. Not a foul even if reviewed. I would not have stopped it either.\n\n  — Mike Pereira (@MikePereira) September 28, 2019\n\nExamining the Eagles’ endless rash of cornerback injuries - NBCSP\nCornerback injuries decimated the Eagles last year. They started the season in Tampa with Jalen Mills and Ronald Darby as the starters and Avonte Maddox, Douglas and Sidney Jones as the backups and they finished it with Cre’Von LeBlanc, Douglas and Maddox as the starters and Josh Hawkins off the bench. The carousel hasn’t stopped turning this year. LeBlanc is on IR. Mills is on PUP. Darby left the Lions game with a hamstring injury and Jones left the Packers game with a hamstring injury. The Eagles beat Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers and the Packers Thursday night at Lambeau Field with two healthy corners, one of whom entered the game having never played a regular-season defensive snap.\n\nJay Ajayi fully recovered from knee surgery, looking for a team - PFT\nAjayi, 26, now is fully healthy and looking for a new team, Ian Rapoport of the NFL reports. Ajayi’s agent has informed all 32 teams he is ready for game action, and Rapoport adds that Ajayi’s “market could heat up quickly.”\n\nEagles release L.J. Fort, Steelers no longer eligible for 2020 compensatory pick - Behind The Steel Curtain\nIt was a scenario I brought up in an article back in May. If one of the players who left the Steelers in free agency in the 2019 offseason were to be released before Week 10 of the NFL season, the Steelers might lose out altogether on a compensatory draft pick. Although the scenario seemed unlikely, it was put more to rest in August when it appeared that Le’Veon Bell, Jesse James, and L.J. Fort would all make their respective teams. Not anymore. On Friday, the Philadelphia Eagles released L.J. Fort, a move that will help them gain an extra compensatory pick while causing the Steelers to no longer enter into the formula.\n\n  The Ravens hosted recently-released Eagles LB L.J. Fort on a visit, per source. Baltimore has an open roster spot and could use some linebacker depth.\n\n  — Field Yates (@FieldYates) September 28, 2019\n\nJets fans are still dejected after the loss to New England - Gang Green Nation\nJets fans have not been confident in their team in weeks. Every week SB Nation sends out a FanPulse survey to fans of each team to gauge their thoughts. After the Week 1 loss to Buffalo, confidence fell greatly. The subsequent loss of Sam Darnold and two defeats have kept it low. This week’s confidence level is 13%. It was 15% last week and 19% the week before.

And don’t even get me started on the hunting. Hunting? Why don’t you just describe it accurately and call it seating your fat ass on the back of that poor sop of a horse and forcing it to canter round your shitty little forest, while you giggle with glee at the delightful experience of bouncing up and down. And all the while you’re accompanied by a large band of trumpeters, making absolutely sure every single animal with a brain has enough time to hear this ludicrous ensemble of idiocy, pack up its family, maybe have a small bite to eat and move the fuck away. Quite frankly, anything stupid enough to be caught by this moronic party had it coming. If the hunting party didn’t get them, an angry 6 year old with a small stick would’ve done the next morning. \n\nBut I’ve side-tracked. The more important debate here is how the fuck this man managed to become a knight. I’d call him stupid but that would be an insult to uneducated peons everywhere. He is his own class of stupid, so far down the IQ scale he may have broken into previously unexplored realms of negative IQ. Oh, you think I’m being mean? Maybe a bit overdramatic? Oh no no no. Let me explain. This is the man who, when getting out of a double bed, rolled over the wrong way to the other side of the bed and, rather than realise his mistake and either rolling the other way to escape the bed, or continuing his roll to reach the other side, shouted desperately for help, for he had lost the floor and was surely doomed. This is the man who picked up a sword from the wrong end and failed to understand his mistake. This is the man who put a helmet on his foot and complained when he couldn’t walk properly. Please understand, my master is genuinely something else. I’ve yet to theorise how he became a knight. Oh yes, his father was a knight and that grants him an easy ride to the role, but I am amazed that, after discovering that his son had the intelligence of a melon, his dear father hadn’t pushed him to follow an alternative career path, something more appropriate to his level like, ooh I don’t know, an early grave. \n\nToo far? Perhaps. But you don’t have to serve under this infantile baboon. Every waking moment of my day is spent entertaining his every want and need, and oh boy does he have a lot of needs. Sometimes – and I wish I was joking – he struggles with wiping his own ass. Guess who gets that fantastic job? That’s right, Squire Perry, his faithful fucking assistant. Other highlights include: serving him his food; helping him eat his food; cleaning his food when he spills it on the floor, like the clumsy halfwit he is; cleaning his bed; cleaning his clothes; organising his equipment. Oh, and how could I forget, fetching his fucking horse when he wants to go on a fucking hunting expedition.\n\nI should go, he might cry if he doesn’t get his bloody horse soon.

Söderlund found the response to be both ignorant and beside the point. ”These are people who are uneducated — they don’t understand that this is a plausible scenario, and listen: this is a game,” he says.\n\nExecutive producer Aleksander Grøndal also pushed back against the hashtag, saying the developer “will always put fun over authentic.” Nor is this a new development for the series. As general manager Oskar Gabrielson explained on Twitter, “the _Battlefield_ sandbox has always been about playing the way you want.” This sometimes means offering fantastical experiences that are neither realistic nor historically accurate, “like attempting to fit three players on a galloping horse, with flamethrowers. With _BFV_ you also get the chance to play as who you want. This is #everyonesbattlefield.”\n\nEA’s dogged response to this debacle marks another instance of creators standing up against toxic fan bases who seek to rail against diversity and what they view as “PC politics.” When creators speak out against bad actors — whether they’re addressing Comicsgate, _Rick and Morty_, or harassment from _Star Wars_ fans — they’re sending a powerful message about how abusive and exclusionary behavior will not be tolerated.\n\nGaming today is more gender-diverse than it’s ever been, Söderlund says, and there are “a lot of female people who want to play, and male players who want to play as a badass [woman].” In trying to explain the so-called controversy to his own 13-year-old daughter, Söderlund says he came to realize how ridiculous the conceit of the online backlash was. “I’m like, okay, as a parent, how the hell am I gonna respond to this?

He’d heard the story about a million times, from his friends and teachers and family, but he loved it best when his mother told it. Besides, the holiday was tomorrow, and hearing the story would help calm his excitement enough to sleep. His mother smiled at him and adjusted his pillows.\n\t“Are you sure? You practically know it by heart at this point,” she replied. He looked up at her and smiled an imploring smile.\n\t“Please?”\n\tHis mother laughed a little and sat down next to him on the bed. \n\t“Well...okay,” she whispered. She looked out his window and saw the holiday’s festive banner flapping from between two street lamps on the road. The banner read “Welcome to the 3045 Celebration of Die Sine Timere!” It waved back and forth in the wind. She turned back to Jerry, who was now propped up on his pillows and looking at her expectantly. \n\t“Okay, okay. Well,” she began, “Our story begins a long time ago, way back in 2015. Our ancestors who lived in that time were not like the way we are today. They were wild and crazy and very violent. The whole world was fighting a war with each other, and it was not the first time everyone had been fighting. They loved fighting each other, and they’d find any excuse to go to do it. They fought over religion and money and--”\n\t“And oil!” interrupted Jerry excitedly. \n\t“Yes, love, and oil. They even fought over who got to live where. It was very silly, but very dangerous. You see, millions of people, innocent people and soldiers alike were getting killed every day. It was horrible. Families were being ripped apart and nobody seemed to be able to make sense of it all. Nobody seemed to understand that everyone was the same underneath the skin and that war was a bad thing. Everyone bleeds red, darling, but our ancestors were too blinded by greed and hatred to see the common color underneath people’s skin. So they fought and fought for years. Finally, one day everyone woke up from sleeping and realized that they had killed off more than half the people on Earth. There used to be seven billion people living there, but now there was only about two billion. Some of the ground was permanently stained red from all the bloodshed. Even the clouds were damaged, and there were holes in the sky from all the bad things our ancestors had put up there. Things had gotten so bad that all the countries knew that they had to stop killing and stop wasting things and stop fighting.”\n\t“Did they stop killing each other, Mummy?” asked Jerry, even though he already knew the answer.\n\t“Yes, they did, darling. All the countries came together and talked about their problems and decided to stop all wars forever. Everyone began to get along, slowly but surely, and the people started sharing their things with each other. Nobody got called any names and everyone was equal. The first few years of peace were a little scary, because people weren’t sure how long it was going to last. But as the fourth year of peace passed, it became obvious to everyone that it was here to stay. All the leaders of all the countries came together that year and decided that there should be a day of remembrance and happiness and celebration as a global holiday, to be celebrated until the end of peace. They put this holiday on August 21st, which was the day all the wars ended. They decided to call this day “Die Sine Timere,” which is from a very very old language called Latin, and it means “Day Without Fear.” They said that on this day, all the people were to celebrate another year of peace and remember our mistakes in the past to keep us safe in the future. They said that people could celebrate and remember any way they saw fit, but they must be sure to celebrate it each year. Our country celebrates by having large block parties and getting all the communities together for a good time. And for you and all the other children, darling, it’s the one night of the year where you don’t have to go to bed before midnight. You get to stay up very late. And before everyone does go to bed on the night of Die Sine Timere, each family sits together in silent meditation to remember those who died and to help us remain peaceful for the following year.”\n\t“Tell me about the lanterns, Mummy. Don’t forget the lanterns,” whispered Jerry, whose eyes were closed now. He was not quiet asleep yet, just listening quietly to the story of his favorite holiday in peace. \n\t“Ah, yes, the lanterns,” said his mother, who now was stroking her son’s hair gently as she spoke. “Well, in all the countries around the world, there is one thing that all our ceremonies of peace have in common. Every single person or family makes a special lantern out of biodegradable paper, and they each write a wish for the future or a memory of the past on that lantern. Then, at exactly midnight, each person or family lights the lantern and sends it into the sky, and all the wishes and memories get to soar the night skies together. It’s very beautiful and is a symbol of our unity and peace.”\n\t“It’s like watching all our wishes come true,” whispered Jerry. \n\t“That it is, my love. That it is,” replied his mother, “And every year, the whole world does the same thing. For one day a year, we remember our unity and how lucky we are to be at peace. Each person meditating or releasing a lantern or playing in the park during the day is a promise for the future. We will remain peaceful, so long as we have this hope.” She stopped, for that was the end of the story. She and her son sat quietly together for a moment, before Jerry let out a contented sigh and rolled on his side, eyes still shut tight. \n\tHis mother looked down at his little sleeping face and smiled. She leaned down and gently kissed his forehead before getting up off the bed. She tucked the blankets up to his chin and turned to walk away. \n\t“Mummy?” Jerry said quietly.\n\t“Yes, darling?” said his mother, turning back towards her son.\n\t“Goodnight, Mummy. I love you.”\n\t“I love you too, Jerry. Goodnight.”\n\nShe shut off his light and headed downstairs to prepare the rice paper for the lanterns for tomorrow night, so that she and her son could silently watch all their wishes come true.

Eighth Judicial District Court_, which entitled every defendant charged with misdemeanor domestic battery to a jury trial in the State of Nevada. The case has been called “the most significant Nevada Supreme Court case of the 21st century.”[2]\n\n\nBackground\n\nPariente graduated with a degree in Business Administration at the University of New Mexico in 1990 and received a master's degree in Public Affairs from the University of Texas at Austin in 1995.[3] He received his J.D. degree from Baylor Law School in 1998.[4] Pariente is admitted to practice law in the State of Nevada and the State of Texas. He previously served as an Assistant District Attorney for DUI prosecutions and as an Assistant Federal Public Defender in El Paso, Texas.[5]\n\nPariente is the son of Esther Pariente-Ahmed and electrical engineer and computer scientist Nasir Ahmed.\n\n\nNoteworthy cases\n\n_Andersen v. Eighth Judicial District Court_\n\nIn 2019, Pariente successfully litigated what has been called “the most significant Nevada Supreme Court case of the 21st century.”[6]\n\nIn _Andersen v. Eighth Judicial District Court_, the defendant was charged with battery which constitutes domestic violence, a first offense, and was set to stand trial in the Las Vegas Municipal Court. He asked for a jury trial, but in accordance with longstanding Nevada law, was told he was not entitled to a jury for a misdemeanor charge. He pled no contest and was found guilty, and appealed his conviction based on the fact that he was denied his right to a jury.[7]\n\nThe case eventually made it to the Nevada Supreme Court. Pariente argued that a defendant charged with battery constituting domestic violence has a Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial because a defendant loses his or her Second Amendment right upon conviction of the offense by letting a judge, and not a jury, decide guilt or innocence.[8] The Court reversed the defendant's conviction, and declared that henceforth, for the first time since Nevada became a state in 1864, every defendant charged with misdemeanor domestic battery is entitled to a jury trial.\n\n“The Nevada Supreme Court’s Sept. 12 decision held that misdemeanor domestic violence defendants are entitled to a jury trial because of a 2017 law banning those convicted of the crime from owning guns. The ban on gun ownership elevated the crime from a petty offense that doesn’t entitle a defendant to a jury to a more serious offense with jury rights, the court said.”[9]\n\n\nAftermath of _Andersen_\n\nFollowing the Nevada Supreme Court's decision in _Andersen v. Eighth Judicial District Court_, many cities, including the city of Las Vegas, have fought to undermine the verdict.[10] Pariente has been critical of Las Vegas City Council and its efforts to bypass the verdict by enacting its own ordinance which circumvents the law created by the Nevada Supreme Court in _Andersen._ Pariente has publicly called the ordinance “absurd, pathetic and desperate” and has vowed to take the matter to the Nevada Supreme Court or the Supreme Court of the United States, if necessary.”[11]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n","title":"Michael Pariente"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say is a notable achievement of Michael Pariente?","answers":[{"answer":"One of Michael Pariente's notable achievements is leading the case known as Andersen v.

After he walked through the yard to the driveway, he made sure to latch the gate securely, because that’s what Sarah liked. He smiled as he did so, and thought of how earlier, he had closed the shower curtain all the way (another Sarah preference), and gently lowered the toilet seat. Twenty four hours earlier, they had been feuding; and he deliberately did none of these things; just to piss her off!  As he climbed into his car for his daily sucky commute up Route 128 to Route 93; into Boston, he was filled with regret and chuckled at the pettiness of his previous day’s actions. After all; how hard was it to accommodate several very minor quirks of his wife of fifteen years?\n\n\nThat morning, he had been awakened by Sarah gently kissing around his ear, nuzzling against his back, softly stroking his shoulders. This was in stark contrast to the previous three nights; when she had seemed to build an invisible wall between them. Sarah was an expert at staying on her “side”. No inadvertent touching during the night; not even a slight brush of the leg or a stray rollover. Her version of a cold shoulder was more like a frozen cadaver.\n\n\nHer affections this morning, were surely a signal that an olive branch had been extended; and a peace treaty had been declared. The latest “war of the Floyds”; a seventy two hour skirmish; had ended.\n\n\nThe latest battle had been initiated on Saturday night; a dinner outing with their best friends. After several before and after cocktails;  Sarah, in response to what Gary felt was a very innocuous comment about Sarah’s weight gain over the past ten years, had flipped Gary “the bird”.  While Gary waited in traffic to access the on ramp to 128, he conjured up the incident in his brain. He mused about the fury that could be unleashed by a simple injudicious observation; but he also felt ashamed of his immature pouting and anger in response to such a mundane gesture as a raised middle finger. \n\n\nSarah and Gary were complete opposites. Sarah loved to go to the mall and shop for hours. Gary detested the thought of entering even one store. Sarah hated watching sports, Gary loved all sports. Sarah was fastidious, she cleaned and scrubbed meticulously. Gary was a slob; who would often ask Sarah to “give it a break, the house is clean enough”; (especially when she vacuumed the living room while he was watching a football game).\n\n\nGary inched onto Route 93 South, and switched from sports talk to a Sirius 70s radio station. The subscription to Sirius had been a birthday gift from Sarah. Gary had told her that it was an unnecessary expense; there were plenty of free radio stations, but Sarah insisted. Gary had come to love the non-stop oldies from the 60s and 70s. Steppenwolf blasted from the speakers, and he howled in unison when they belted out the refrain; “Born to be Willlllllllllllllllld”, and for a moment. envisioned himself a single dude; no wife, no twelve year old son (Steven), no boring nine-to-five job, no responsibilities, no hassles!\n\n\nHe clicked the stereo radio control on the steering wheel and jumped back to the 60s station, ironically, to The Monkees’ sweet ballad, “I Want to be Free”.  This only reinforced his thirst for liberation and his distaste for married life. He was sick of the petty arguments and all the compromises that he made for family. Hell, his weekly night out with the guys had been reduced lately to monthly night out! \n\n\nAll day long, while Gary answered EMails, juggled spreadsheets, and performed his daily office tasks, a yearning stirred within him to be rid of all the shackles that he had placed upon himself. He daydreamed about quitting his well paying but stressful job and become a full-time bartender; hang out all day drinking beer and watching sporting events.  As this lovely picture played out in his mind, the phone on his desk beeped; and the caller ID readout revealed that Sarah was on the line. \n\n\nGary picked up the receiver, and told Sarah, “We need to talk”. \n\n\n“Yes”, Sarah replied softly. \n\n\nBefore he could say anything else, Sarah apologized for the three day freezeout. She also informed Gary that she had arranged a sleepover that night at the neighbor’s for Steven; and that she would be making Gary’s favorite dinner: fresh sliced fries and baked filet mignon with butter, mushrooms, and onion ring.  Dessert was to be decided upon later, by Gary! \n\n\nFor the balance of the day; Gary’s fantasies swerved in a different direction. His aspiration to live the single life dissipated. and the longing that he previously experienced was replaced by a sense of appreciation for Sarah’s humility, caring and tenderness. His thoughts about separation reverted to anticipation of their approaching union. He regretted the joking remark he made that had kicked off their most recent tiff. He knew his wife was super-sensitive about her body image, and would not be pleased with his attempt at humor.\n\n\nThe drive home featured unusually clear sailing on the highways. As Gary rounded the corner and turned onto his street, one of his favorite Bob Seger songs came on the radio: “Beautiful Loser”. He chortled at the lyrics:\n\n\n“He wants his home and security ………… He wants to live like a sailor at sea”.\n\n\nAs he mulled the sentiment, a rueful smile came upon his face. He reached for the kitchen doorknob, but Sarah swung it open before he had a chance to push. She jumped into his arms.\n\n\n“How was your day, baby?”\n\n\n“I love you, Sarah.”\n","title":"[HM] - Gary &amp; Sarah"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize how Gary feels about his life.","answers":[{"answer":"He feels like he is in a rut, and he is sick of the petty arguments and compromises he has to make for his family.

He was the younger son of the Viennese Secession artists Alfred and Mileva Roller.\n\n\nLife and career\n\nIn July 1934 Ulrich was one of the Austrian Nazis that unsuccessfully attempted to overthrow the dictator Engelbert Dollfuss. The Rollers had a country home by the Mondsee, and it was in this area that Ulrich took part in the fighting.[1] When the putsch failed, Ulrich was arrested and detained for two years in the same internment camp that Dollfuss detained communists and social democrats.[2] His father rushed from the Bayreuth Festival when he heard of his son's arrest, but Ulrich never saw his father again. Alfred died in Vienna in 1935.\n\nAt the time of the putsch Ulrich had been studying stage design at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, the same institution to which Hitler had twice unsuccessfully applied.[3] Upon release from internment, Winifred Wagner immediately appointed Ulrich as an assistant for the 1936 Festival. Six years Wieland's senior, Ulrich was tall and attractive, and quickly became Wieland's admired friend and mentor.[4] Wieland would often send Ulrich examples of his own stage designs asking him how to make them better.[5] Ulrich was to have worked with Wieland for the projected new production of _Tannhäuser_ at the 1942 Festival for which Ulrich had already designed the costumes.[6] When the 1936 Festival ended, Ulrich embarked on a promising career at the German Opera in Berlin under the kindly paternalistic eye of Hitler.[7] He was, however, back in Bayreuth for the 1937 Festival when, after one of the Festival's performances Hitler gave a reception for the Bayreuth artists and held court long into the night during which, with one eye on Ulrich, he told the story of how he had been too in awe of his father, Alfred Roller, to approach him at the Vienna State Opera.[8]\n\nImmediately after the Anschluss, in March 1938, Ulrich returned to Vienna where he became the stage designer and head of the costume department at the Vienna State Opera.[9] To honour and celebrate the 75th birthday of Richard Strauss, the company premiered the composer's one act opera, Friedenstag (Day of Peace). Hitler arrived for the performance unannounced to cast his eye over his protege's work, and project himself as the Prince of Peace.[10] Ulrich went on to work with Strauss on the sets for the projected second part of the opera double-bill, Daphne.[11]\n\n\nMilitary service and death\n\nOn 1 November 1940 Ulrich was conscripted for military service. The call-up letter was sent to the Vienna State Opera which made no attempt to retain him. Goebbels would later note in his diary that the State Opera handled the whole affair with unfortunate laxness.[12] Along with Wieland and twenty-three other young men whom Hitler and Winifred had identified, Ulrich was declared one of the “divinely blessed”, and subsequently exempted from front line military service.[13] His political credibility qualified him for a guard's role in the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV), literally Death's Head Unit, which was responsible for administering the Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps where he was posted to the homosexuals' section of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp at Oranienburg.[14] Confronted by what he saw and experienced there Ulrich had what Hamann calls 'an existential crisis' and begged Winifred to release him from the list of the divinely blessed but he would not say why. Eventually she relented and Ulrich was posted to front line service near Moscow. Ulrich was killed on 28 December 1941 in the village of Stollpomka near Kaluga during the Russian campaign.[15] Hitler was furious when he heard of Ulrich's death. It was, Winifred admitted, the one time when he was really angry with her.[16]\n\n  Some Russian idiot shooting down a man like that! Look how many we have classified exempt from service; what difference does it make if five or six hundred talented people are let off? You can't replace a man like that![17]\n\nWhen Winifred heard of Ulrich's death she wrote to Mileva, a woman she did not personally know:\n\n  The news has just reached me, though I cannot grasp it yet, that your dear son Uli has died a hero's death for his fatherland and his beloved Führer. I bow my head in silent respect for what you, his mother, must be going through...For us it is like losing a dear member of the family. (Bayreuth is in mourning) for the loss of such an extraordinarily gifted artist - whom Wieland had selected to be his eventual collaborator ...Now his young life has been fulfilled, and he died as he lived: believing in the Führer and the National Socialist ideal; believing in the great fatherland of the future. He was faithful unto death, and set a shining example to us all.[18]\n\nIn a later statement, the Roller family contradicted Winifred's opinion stating that Ulrich's death should be interpreted as an act of suicide.[19]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] Nachlassverzeichnis Ulrich Roller\n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n","title":"Ulrich Roller"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about Roller's stage design work?","answers":[{"answer":"Roller was studying stage design at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna when were one of the Austrian Nazis that unsuccessfully attempted to overthrow Engelbert Dollfuss.

My parents, fiancee,and I were in a fatal two car accident 15 years ago.  I was the only survivor; six other people died.  I lost it after that.  Nothing else mattered at all.  I spent a few years trying to drink and drug myself to death.  It didn't work.  I had a cold empty chill in my body that would not leave.  I began stealing, grafting, and hustling people just for something evil to do.  I had no conscience left.  No matter what I did, there was no feeling of remorse.  While hanging out in an Irish pub on the south side of Boston one afternoon, I was approached by a fellow drinking about doing a hit.  At first, I thought he was kidding or the booze was talking.  However, he told me he had heard about my con rackets around the neighborhood and that the Irish mobsters weren't too happy about it.  I needed to do this hit to make peace.  I thought, \"What the fuck.\"  That's how I became a hit-man. \n\n   I'll fast forward ten years.  I had become the primary hit-man for the Irish mob in the greater Boston area.  My severe lack of any soul or conscience made me a perfectly built killing machine.  In fact, I even got off on it in a way.  It seemed to help fill the empty hole in my life.  I know that may seem contradictory, but the loss of my loved ones changed me deeply.  It made me a monster.  Before I started killing for a living, I would stay awake for days dwelling on the reason why I survived the crash.  I could not come to terms with it.  Being a hit-man allowed me to sleep.  It removed me from my depression.  I had no remorse for the people I killed and I could care less if I got caught.  My life, nor anyone else's, had any meaning to me.  I was perfect. \n\n   Yesterday, I met \"One Thumb\" McShane at Paddy's Pub.  He gave me the address and the last name of a guy I was to take care of.  The guy ran a deli in a mob controlled neighborhood.  He had stopped paying protection money and was rallying other shop owners to follow suit.  This could not continue.  \"One Thumb\" gave me $1500 up front and told me take care of it right away.  I nodded and ordered a double Bushmills.  I waited for darkness to set in and set out for the mark's house.  \n\n  The mark lived near the neighborhood I grew up in.  I rolled up in front of the old brownstone and I saw him through the dining room window.  He was a single guy.  I didn't have to worry about family members.  I cased the spot for an hour.  The scene looked ripe.  I grabbed my gun, stuck in my shoulder holster, and walked across the street.  He opened the door for me and had a look of surprise.  I asked, \"Are you Mr. Brennan?\"  He swallowed hard and said, \"Yeah, what do you want.\"  I stared coldly at him for a moment.  I finally said, \"Some folks are telling me you're not paying them some owed money.  They aren't too happy.  They want something done.\"  He wobbled a bit and braced himself against the kitchen table.  His nervousness gave me a rush.  He knew why I was there.  I asked, \"What are we going to do about this Mr. Brennan?\"  He cried, \"Look man, my parents opened this deli 40 years ago.  If I pay the protection money, I can't afford to stay open.  FUCK!  I don't want to lose my family deli.\"  A memory came over me.  I softly said, \"Brennan's Deli?  You're the Charlie Brennan from Perkin's Elementary?\"  You grew up in this neighborhood?\"  He looked up, stared at me for a minute, and asked, \"Holy shit! Roman?\"  I nodded and a wave of something I hadn't felt in a long time rushed over me.  I had some feelings come back.  They were raw and piercing.  I had buried them for so long.  Charlie had been a friend. \n\n   When were in 5th grade, Charlie and I were walking home one evening.  Charlie was walking backwards so he could face me.  A car came screeching down the road and Charlie saw it swerving at us.  He yelled for me to get out of the way.  I slipped in some gravel and fell.  The car was speeding closer.  Charlie grabbed the hood of my jacket and pulled me between two parked cars; just as the car nicked my shoe.  I would have been killed that night if it weren't for Charlie.  I hadn't thought about that for a long time.  That was the first time I realized my own mortality.  When I was in the accident with my parents and fiancee, my mortality left me.  Seeing Charlie made me get a little of that back.  Had Charlie saved my life again?  I couldn't do what I had intended; not to Charlie.  I told him some of what had happened to me.  I told what he had given me back.  We talked for awhile.  The memories filled my head and dizzied me.   \n\n   After another hour of talking, I got up to leave.  Charlie was walking in front of me to get the door.  I took out my garrote and wrapped it tightly around Charlie's neck.  I drew him close to me.  I whispered in his ear, \"You should have let me die that night Charlie.  I would never have had to live with the obscene emotional pain of that car accident.  I was supposed to die that night you bastard.\"  The life escaped his body and his legs fell limp.  The emptiness returned to my body.  \n\n  ","title":"[TH] The Accident"},"questions":[{"question":"Why did the narrator continue to kill for the Irish mob after he had completed the first hit?","answers":[{"answer":"He was a cold-blooded killer who felt nothing.

We had a century to plan for this one asteroid, barely 100 km wide, but only the rich saved themselves, went off to their ships and left us all here to die. They promised the military refuge, but when the asteroid came sooner than expected, they just turned tails and ran. For the last 2 years, I’ve been searching for survivors along with my squadron and what we found isn’t what we expected nor is it pleasing. The outside world is a wasteland devoid of life… until now.\nWhile patrolling the perimeter we heard a small cry. When we found the source we were surprised by a small girl around 12 who looked confused and scared. We helped her up and took her to our base. Along the ride she started mumbling incomprehensible sounds and when we tried calming her she just blurted “They’re coming” and fell unconscious.\nSubsequently, we stabilized her and let sleep overcome her. Then my squad and I started talking, thinking who this girl was, how had she survived, and most importantly what she meant by “They’re coming”. Of course the latter gave us all the creeps, although nobody openly admitted it. That was, after all, what the military was all about; showing strength and hiding weakness no matter what the situation presented.\nWhen she finally woke up, we stared at her with expectant eyes and after an unbearable minute she got the cue and started explaining, to be honest, it’s not what any of us expected.\n“They’re coming, we have to run.” She said in a normal fashion.\n“Who the hell’s coming!” At that point, I’d lost my temper and started screaming at her.\n“The ones who did this to us and the only ones who escaped it,” she exclaimed as she pointed towards the wasteland that lay behind us. Her words stinging and leaving a bitter taste in the back of our mind.\nThe same people who had promised to save us were the same people who set doom upon us. I was startled and couldn’t believe her words, didn’t want to believe her words. I mean, the scientist said an asteroid was coming, but a little push to it would explain why it came sooner, and according to this girl that little push was made by the rich folks. After a while of trying to explain to myself how it was possible since I couldn’t find any other explanation, she continued to talk:\n“There’s a way to stop them,”\n“Why would we?” I questioned, “We barely know you and now you’re asking us to stop an imaginary enemy who might or might not come here to destroy what’s left of us.”\n“If you don’t believe me look outside,” \nJust to prove her wrong, I walked through the door and took a peek outside. In the middle of the wasteland, I saw a single human figure just staring at us as if waiting for something. Then... all hell broke lose. As it came charging towards the encampment at an unnatural speed sirens started blaring to announce the base was on high alert. We grabbed our weapons and prepared for battle. Since we couldn't trust anyone, we started firing when it got within firing range. The bullets clashed against his skin, but it didn’t even flinch. \n“I told you so,” I heard from behind me. It was the girl again.\n“Would you shut the f-,” I retorted but, before I could finish she proceeded to use her arm as blades that went right through my upper torso, and with a vicious smile she pushed even farther until I could see the blood dripping off her fists.\n“They’re coming.”\n Those were the last words I heard before darkness embraced me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"[SF] They're Coming"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the main conflict.","answers":[{"answer":"The main conflict is that an asteroid is coming and the rich people have left the planet.

The president’s lawyer has admitted that the president paid off a porn star to keep her quiet during the campaign and has been lying about it ever since. He also admitted that the president fired the FBI director because he had refused to publicly state that the president wasn’t under investigation. He also thinks that pretty much everyone in the Justice Department should be fired in order to bring the current investigation of the president to a halt.

The collaboration, Abboud claimed, allowed the Interior staffer to prop up Zinke at the expense of Pruitt, and Chmielewski to “get back” at his former boss.\n\n  ….IT IS UNCLEAR THE EXTENT TO WHICH PRUITT WAS AWARE OF THESE EVENTS. Even so, the message from PPO, according to the senior official, was: “Basically, y’all are in trouble.” A White House official with knowledge of the events added: “ABSOLUTELY NOTHING SCOTT PRUITT DID WOULD SURPRISE ME.” Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for Interior, and Raj Shah, a spokesman for the White House, both declined to comment.\n\nIn case you’re confused, the story is that Zinke planned to leak damaging information about Pruitt. So Pruitt then leaked _that_ story in order to damage Zinke.\n\nAs for whether Pruitt was aware of these events, give me a break. Hell, it was probably his idea. Pruitt is now at the center of so many corruption allegations that I can’t even keep track of them, and his defense for every one of them has been that it was somebody else’s fault and he had no idea what was going on. Nobody with two brain cells to rub together believes him. Why believe him this time?\n\nBut wait. I forgot. Let’s get back to the president for a minute. The president’s lawyer _also_ said that he opposed having the president talk to the special counsel because he didn’t want the president walking into a perjury trap. But a perjury trap only works if the target has done something wrong and gets blindsided during an interview. That’s how Ken Starr bagged Bill Clinton. It _doesn’t_ work if either (a) the target has done nothing wrong or (b) the target knows a perjury trap is coming. Since Donald Trump insists he’s done nothing wrong and his lawyer has obviously warned him about a perjury trap, then he should have nothing to worry about.\n\nJust a wild guess here, but I’m thinking that Trump has not only done something wrong, but he’s done so many things wrong that he can’t even keep them straight. Thus a perjury trap remains a live possibility.\n\nAnyway, it’s kind of funny that Republicans are so disturbed by perjury traps these days. They seemed to think they were great fun back in 1998.\n\nOh, and one other thing. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was so affronted at being called a liar at the WHCD last weekend, has been lying about Stormy Daniels all along too. Or maybe Trump has been lying to her. Who knows? In any case, she’s refusing to comment about it. I think this is probably a smart move.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Describe the main point being discussed in this article.

conservatives have hit back at a proposed bill that would impose harsher sentences on people performing gay ‘cure’ therapy, saying that the bill would lead to a ban on the Bible.\n\nOn April 18 the California Assembly voted to support harsher penalties for those performing gay conversion therapy in the state, opting to treat the treatment as a form of consumer fraud.\n\nBill AB-2943, which was greenlit by state lawmakers on Wednesday, would build on the existing policies to introduce a possible conviction under state law for gay ‘cure’ practitioners.\n\nPerforming gay cure therapy on minors is already is illegal in ten US states and counting, as well as Switzerland, Malta, Taiwan, two Canadian provinces, and the Australian state of Victoria.\n\nIf enacted, California would join Illinois and Connecticut in explicitly making ‘conversion therapy’ subject to consumer protection laws.\n\nGay ‘cure’ therapy has been widely debunked by multiple major medical organisations around the world.\n\nTravis Allen — a member of the California Assembly and Republican candidate for Governor — recently hit back at the state’s proposed bill, explicitly saying that it would ban the Bible in California.\n\n[]\n\nIn an interview with conservative cable news channel One America News, Allen said: “According to how this law is written, yes, it would.”\n\n“This is, you know, PC culture, politically correct culture, gone horribly awry.\n\n“This is really directly hitting at our First Amendment rights as American citizens.”\n\nRELATED: REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER CLAIMS OUTLAWING GAY CURE THERAPY WOULD ALSO BAN JESUS\n\nThe interview quickly went viral, prompting conspiracy-debunking website Snopes to challenge the idea, rating it as “false.”\n\nDespite the lack of evidence for the claim that the anti-gay cure therapy bill would ban any religious texts, many other conservatives have hit out at the bill.\n\n[Gay Cure in the (Fort Worth Weekly]\nWilhelm Joys Andersen)\nAnti-LGBT law group Alliance Defending Freedom, which has been at the forefront of the evangelical fight against gay sex, issued a memo March 8 stating that the bill was an attack on free speech.\n\nThe memo reads: “At its core, AB 2943 outlaws speech, whether offered by a licensed counsellor, a best-selling author, or even a minister or religious leader.\n\n“It targets a specific message — that an adult who is experiencing unwanted same-sex attraction or gender identity confusion can find help to address those issues — for censorship.”\n\nAlthough the memo did not specifically say that the Bible itself would be threatened, it did state that bookshops would be banned from selling texts that “challenged gender identity ideology.”\n\n“A bookstore (including online bookstores like Amazon) could not sell many recently published books challenging gender identity ideology and advocating that these beliefs should be rejected by society,” said the Alliance Defending Freedom memo.\n\nRELATED: UK GOVERNMENT FINALLY PREPARING TO ‘END THE PRACTICE’ OF GAY AND TRANSGENDER CURE THERAPY\n\nThere is no part of the bill that would prevent the sale of religious texts or other books.\n\nThe bill, submitted by out lawmaker Evan Low, would amend the section of the existing Civil Code section on fraud which deals with “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” – such as financial misrepresentation, false commercial claims and deliberate misselling to consumers – to include a prohibition on “advertising, offering to engage in, or engaging in sexual orientation change efforts with an individual”.\n\nOn April 19 the bill passed by a vote of 50 to 18 and will now head to the California State Senate for consideration.\n\n[]\n(Dr Christian Jessen investigated gay ‘cure’ therapy as part of the documentary “Cure me, I’m gay.” Photo: Channel 4)\nEvan Low, Chair of the LGBT Legislative Caucus, said: “Study after study has shown that ‘conversion therapy’ is ineffective, damaging, and counterproductive.\n\n“It is our duty to protect Californians from such deceptive practices that will expose them to physical and emotional harm.”\n\nHRC National Field Director Marty Rouse said: “Today, California legislators rightfully declared that so-called ‘conversion therapy’ is a complete sham and those who offer this deceptive and dangerous practice must be held accountable.\n\n“California was the first state to protect minors from being subjected to conversion therapy by state-licensed health care providers, and today’s vote is an important step to protecting all LGBTQ people from this debunked practice.\n\n“We thank the assembly members who voted in favour of AB 2943 and urge the Senate to swiftly advance the bill to Governor Jerry Brown’s desk.”\n\n[]\n\nConnecticut, California, Nevada, New Jersey, the District of Columbia, Oregon, Illinois, Vermont, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Washington all have laws protecting youth from gay

Experts believe the assault to be the work of the Islamic State.]\n\nCredit...Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters\n\n-   Dec. 29, 2017\n\nCAIRO — At least nine people were killed when gunmen opened fire on a Coptic Orthodox Church in Cairo on Friday, a church spokesman said, in the latest in a series of attacks on Egypt’s Christian minority.\n\nThe assault targeted the Mar Mina Church in the southern Cairo neighborhood of Helwan. At least one gunman was killed by the police, the spokesman, Boules Haliem, said by telephone.\n\n“He did not manage to get in,” Mr. Haliem said of the gunman. Worshipers were attacked as they were leaving the church, he said, and at least eight were killed, along with one police officer. Eight more worshipers and a police officer were wounded.\n\n“The church was full,” Mr. Haliem said. “They were attending Mass.” Photographs showed several bullet holes in the facade of the church.\n\nTwo of the wounded were in critical condition, he said.\n\nCoptic Christians make up about 10 percent of Egypt’s population of 96 million. This was not the first deadly assault on Christian worshipers in Cairo, but the capital is not accustomed to this sort of attack on civilians.\n\nThe Islamic State extremist group claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement that was circulated on the messaging app Telegram. The statement said that 10 people had been killed, and it described the victims as “crusaders” and “apostates.” The statement also said that one of the attackers had been killed.\n\nThe assault came just over a month after Egypt’s deadliest terror attack, in which more than 300 Sufi Muslims were killed at a mosque in the Sinai Peninsula, as the militant group steps up its campaign of violence against Egypt’s minorities.\n\nThe Islamic State declared its intention to attack Egyptian Christians last year as it seeks a stronger foothold in Egypt after defeats in Syria and Iraq. It has since killed more than 100 Egyptian Copts by bombing churches and attacking buses carrying pilgrims.\n\nImage[Egyptian police officers inspecting the site of the attack on Friday.]\n\nCredit...Samer Abdallah/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\n\nThe group already had a strong presence in the northern half of the Sinai Peninsula, where it has been targeting police and military installations.\n\nMilitant attacks increased in Egypt after the military overthrew the country’s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, in 2013, and cracked down on his supporters and dissidents of all stripes.\n\nThe shooting on Friday is likely to rattle the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. To many, the assault is a disturbing reminder of the militants’ expanding activity in mainland Egypt.\n\nEgyptian state media also reported the death of a gunman, and added that another assailant — a gunman who also had a homemade bomb with him — was arrested later in the day.\n\nThe second man, who was riding a motorcycle, was armed with an automatic rifle, and the police were said to have restrained him just before he tried to throw the bomb into the church.\n\nIt remains unclear exactly how many assailants were involved. Officials gave conflicting accounts, with some saying that three men were involved and others calling it a lone wolf assault.\n\nSeparately on Friday, a gunman killed two people at an appliance shop in Helwan owned by a Coptic Christian, Mr. Haliem said.\n\nThe Egyptian Interior Ministry, which is in charge of the police, said in a statement that one man had been responsible for the slaughter on Friday. The man was in custody, the ministry said, describing him as “one of the most prominent active terrorist elements” in the country.\n\nA spokesman for the Egyptian police could not be immediately reached for clarification.\n\nThis month, Islamic State militants attacked an airport in Sinai during a visit by the country’s defense and interior ministers. The ministers were unharmed, but one military officer was killed.\n\nPresident Trump called Mr. Sisi on Friday to offer his condolences, the Egyptian president’s office said in a statement. During the call, Mr. Trump “stressed the need to coordinate international efforts in order to combat terrorism,” Mr. Sisi’s office said.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Why is the Islamic State stepping up operations in Egypt?","answers":[{"answer":"It is seeking a stronger foothold in Egypt after defeats in Syria and Iraq.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention the group's declared intention to attack Egyptian Christians.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that the Islamic State is also targeting Egypt's minorities.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that the Islamic State is also targeting Christians.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer does not make sense","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"After defeats in Syria and Iraq, it's not clear that they would be seeking a foothold in Egypt.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer could be more specific.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[0,2,1,null,null,3],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What groups is the Islamic State targeting?","answers":[{"answer":"Egyptian Christians, Sufi Muslims, police and military installations.","critiques":[{"critique":"Doesn't mention Pakistani Christians.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should clarify that the Islamic State is targeting Egyptian Christians and Sufi Muslims.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The police and military installations are not targeted groups.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"Doesn't mention that they are also targeting civilians.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The article does not mention the Islamic State targeting police and military installations.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention the Coptic Orthodox Church.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The police and military installations are not targeted specifically.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The response is missing the second group of people the Islamic State is targeting.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"Where did the Islamic State choose to attack the Copts?","answers":[{"answer":"They picked a church.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer could be more specific.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer should mention the name of the church.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[1,0],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"How many people were effected by the terrorist attack?","answers":[{"answer":"At least nine people were killed and eight were wounded.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention the number of attackers.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null}]}}

Something stronger. Something beautiful. It was the act of not being the person being made fun of.\n\nTim looked around the room and finding no clear target for his rage, decided to punch the coffee maker and then he stormed out as laughter followed him down the halls. \n\nFinally, the room composed itself and Diane began again. \"OK. I'm not feeling a lot of love for the charity. So, let's go ahead and just do our gift exchange, at a restaurant, like usual.\" She smiled at the group.\n\n\"What restaurant?\"\n\nAnd with that, chaos ensued. Employees shot from their chairs and grabbed whatever was nearby and began pummeling their neighbor. \n\n\"Outback!\" \n\n\"Red Robin!\"\n\n\"Ninos!\" \n\n...were the battle cries that day. I hid under a desk and watched Diane use a letter opener to stab Jane in the ear repeatedly.

It was Ruth. She was dragging Michael X's body on a cross she had made from the cubicle uprights. The rest of the employees were dead, dying, or too injured to protest when Ruth, bloodied, stood on her desk and proclaimed \"We shall have a white elephant gift exchange. At Denny's. We will call it a Seasonal Party. We will wear ugly...ugly...sweaters...\" and then she gasped and fell to the ground dead.\n\nThe only sound was Thom continuing to have sex with a fern.\n\nI slowly walked out.

I strongly believe in the Golden Rule. I treat others as I would like to be treated: Holding doors open for those that I sense would have trouble. Giving up my seat to those that look as though they might need it: men, women, and the elderly. Being considerate! Saying thank you, and you're welcome! Thinking of others before myself. Writing \"thank you\" letters when appropriate. Not being mean to animals (perhaps excluding snakes and spiders unless they keep to themselves). I had always helped, and it felt good. But slowly, I began to notice things were changing. I still wanted to help others, but it was getting more difficult as I was passing the 3/4 of a century mark. I would tell my friends (just kidding) that I couldn't associate with people that old. When did I get this old? I have children over 50 and grandchildren over 20. Has society changed? Are its members less caring? I have heard this.\n\nI went to a take-out pizza establishment last week. Going in, I held open the door for a young lady who said \"thank you\", and when I entered, she insisted that I order before she did. The place was busy with little space to stand. When I picked up my order, I had to squeeze my way to the door as there was not much room, and I was having some trouble walking. As I got to the door, it opened. Automatic I thought. I looked down to find a boy of about ten holding it for me and smiling. \"Did I look that feeble?\" I thought. I said thank you, and he was smiling as he said \"your welcome.\" No one had told him to do it. He was on his own. I think it made him feel good! Someone had taught him manners. It feels good to help others.\n\nAnother pizza place I go to has a flight of stairs to overcome. Going up is not a problem, but going down with a pizza in hand is. One of the young employees asked if she could help. I said \"sure\". I went ahead, got in the car, and she handed it through the car window to me, all-the-while sporting a wide grin. Thanks, I said. You are welcome, she replied. Every time I get pizza and she is working, she immediately says \"I'll give it to you through the window.\" I think it makes her feel as good as it does me!\n\nWhen I go to the grocery store, I buy 2-3 weeks of food because I don't know when I will have the energy again(pain when walking, but getting better). The box boys or girls will always ask if they can empty the shopping cart for me. Then they bag the groceries and ask if they can help me load them into the car. I always ask them if they can go home with me and unload them and put them away too. They smile, we joke. I ask them if they are still in school and where they are attending. They are always friendly. I say thank you and they say \"you're welcome\".\n\nWhen did I get old? I stopped playing competitive softball at 70 due to some injuries, but I received a call from one of my softball friends saying that he is forming an 80-year old competitive team and would like me to play on the team. It was nice of him to ask, and I do think he meant it. As soon as I get rid of my pain, I will start slowly working out again. My mind says yes, but my body isn't so sure. I am \"bird-walking\"----getting off the subject now, so must get back on point.\n\nI had an appointment with a pain clinic. I knew the area well but had never seen the medical office. I had the address, but could not find any numbers on the buildings. My car does not have GPS(2002 model), and I was ten minutes late for the meeting. I had to park across the street in a dirt parking lot. The street had moderate traffic, but I managed to get across. The curb must have been at least 18-24 inches high. It seemed like an insurmountable wall, but by holding on to the front of a parked car, I managed to get up. Now there were four steps to climb and a heavy door to open. At the top of the stairs was a man of about 35 years old. He had tattoos on his arms and neck, and smiled at me and politely opened the door. I said thanks. I was told that other patients would have to be seen before me, and the wait might be an hour or more. I decided not to wait. I would go to the car, call my private doctor, tell him my pain situation and see if he would give me a shot for the it.\n\nAs I left the pain center, the tattooed man stood at the base of the steps. He smiled again and asked me if I needed any help. Was he waiting for me to leave so he might mug me? I wobbled down the 4 steps and said no thank you, my car is just across the street. He said, \"You don't look as though you can go that far\". \"If you give me your keys, I will go over and get it for you.\" I thought, \"Sure, then you will drive the car away.\" My car was a 15-year old Hyundai SUV. I didn't trust him even though he had opened a door for me and smiled at the same time. Surely, he had devious intentions. \"This doesn't look good,\" I thought. So, I said, \"I can make it.\" He backed off but watched as I tried to negotiate the 18 in curb. There was no car for me to grab for balance. He began to approach me again, and I began to sweat. There was no one else nearby. He put one arm around my waist and proceeded to lift me off the ground. Then, oh so gently, moved me off the curb and onto the street 18 inches below. \"I hope this helps,\" he said with a smile. \"I'll watch as you cross the street\", he said still smiling. I felt bad that I had jumped to conclusions and again said \"thanks\".\n\nI called my doctor whose office was 10 minutes away. His nurse told me that the doctor said to come in, and he wanted to know if she could give me the shot. I said that would be fine, but I will have a lot of trouble getting out of the car much less getting around to the office as the parking was in the back. He worked from the house that he had turned into his office. He was the only doctor that worked there. I had known him and his nurse for 25 years. She was cute and always in a good mood. She came to the back, needle in hand, had me open the driver's side door, had me pull one side of my pants down an inch exposing my left hip, and with great joy jammed the needle in it.\n\n\"This doesn't look good!,\" I said smiling. \"People might get the wrong idea!\" She laughed, I smiled. This didn't look good, but neither did the fellow with the tattoo. This was all about people that I had met recently and the good that they had done, and how it feels to help others.","title":"[MF] THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD..."},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the kind acts people perform for the narrator.","answers":[{"answer":"At the pizza joint last week, the cashier let the narrator go before her and held the door open for her at the exit.

He had a look of anticipation, as if he was waiting for some pain relieving gossip. \n\n“I was home,” I responded innocently before he rolled his eyes at me. “Now, don’t bother me, I’m trying to focus.” Although normally I would use anything to distract me from school, I wasn’t about to involve Max in last night’s mess.\n\n“Are you expecting me to believe you weren’t at Nina’s party?” He raised his eyebrows at me. I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me. Perhaps I couldn’t fix her parent’s divorce, but I could at least attend her house party. Especially after her break up with Todd, the leather jacket douche that called her “babe” so much I would wonder if he knew her real name.\n\n“I promise you’ll have a great time,” Nina had told me. And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle. Something nostalgic about repetitive rap songs preaching about the wonders of big asses. \n\nEverything seemed normal at first. The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room. I could feel the air thickening. \n\nMinutes before terror, I was standing unnoticed next to a group of girls I recognized. \n\n“Someone told me her dad was abusive,” I heard one say with wide eyes. \n\n“Yeah, apparently the neighbors called the cops on them,” another responded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t point fingers just yet. Nina’s mom’s a bitch. Maybe she deserved it,” a brunette shrugged and took a sip of her drink right before our eyes met. Her face flared red as she realized her words had been overhead. I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry. A millisecond later, I spotted Nina on the floor. Hands covering her face in defense. The lack of light in the room didn’t stop the fierceness of her blood as it dripped down her temple and into her hair. \n\nI stood still. My brain called in fear but my body made no response. Not even when Todd walked passed me, into the hallway and shut the door behind him. \n\nNina remained on the floor. She held herself and rocked back and forth, letting silent cries out into the thick air. \n\n“Don’t tell anyone.” She whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” Max snapped at me. “Are you going to tell me or not?” I stared at him blankly as the vivid flashbacks flew through my head. My heart stung in bitterness as I recognized that all I wanted to do was say it.

The descent into Vanity Heights was a perfect contradiction. Darcy’s den was full of promises. The promises of allure, freedom, revelry. The promises of power and powder, regret, addiction. But the promise that Vanity Heights fulfilled best was not Darcy’s own. It was the promise flashed upon the television, upon the computer screen, canonised on the glossed pages of magazines. The expectations of how teenager life should be; the expectations, up until this night, crushed by education and responsibility. This was the promise that led Darcy’s guests down the stairs. Down the stairs into Vanity Heights. \n\nThe house had transformed into a delinquent ballroom. The girls dropped as low as their heels would allow; their men watched through the haze. Darcy was a dragon. A pink dragon, breathing about the toxic smoke of his habit. He was perched upon his barstool throne, positioned strategically in the centre of the room, when she arrived. \n“Celeste!” he exclaimed, prancing over to her, a stick of addiction in one hand and a glass of hobby in the other. She gave a long hug, a short conversation and an expected question. With a customary smile, Darcy gave to her an expected bottle of answer. \n\nThe party raved on, yet the revelry was muted by the brick wall that barricaded Celeste from the action. The rhythmic dripping of the basin tap was the only music Celeste had, yet she chose to reapply her face instead of dancing. She wanted to dance, though, and she knew Darcy would be waiting for her, so she rushed through her routine. She clasped onto her 50mL glass friend, already thrice-used, even though she had been in the bathroom only five minutes. \n        The drink was downed within seconds of being poured; the liquid sunk to her stomach. She could feel the warm tendrils, cooing words of friendship, branching through her chest, her stomach and finally, finally, back up to drown her mind; pulling her further from the world and closer to her weekend friends. \n        Six doses later, to finish the bottle, and she was ready to join them. \n\nNo one ever really knew why she was there. Good school, great grades, aspirations of business and law. Nevertheless, she was soon jiving and twisting and dropping on the floor, with Darcy and other men: around them and in their laps; their hands hoping to get in hers.  Her beholder lay seemingly dormant in her stomach; though its dark tendrils were tightening, strengthening their grip on Celeste, controlling her like a puppet with tangled strings. She thought the overseer a friend, a protector, but her body knew better.\n\nCeleste mapped her escape as soon as she felt it. Up the stairs, out of Vanity Heights, past the kitchen, into the garden bed just by the backdoor. She pushed through the crowd. Darcy saw her leave; he knew why, but he didn’t follow.  He never did. By the time she reached the stairs, the beast had revealed itself. A kraken, furious as red, limbs thrashing about inside of her, fighting desperately for an escape. Tentacles of fear, doubt, regret, disappointment. \n‘No,’ she thought once more, ‘I shouldn’t be disappointed.’ She knew she wasn't wasting her life; she was just having a little to drink. She wasn’t reckless and irresponsible; she was just a normal teenager. She was just having fun, she has earned it, she would stop after tonight, leave her alone. Her stomach was having none of that, though. She made a mistake by trying to fly the stairs two at a time. Her feet tangled and she fell, the first wave of expel surging from her, onto the steps above.\n\nWhilst the beast had once been considered friend, it had no more. It escaped her again, covering her hair, clothes, face. She tried to pull herself further up the stairs, but the sickly purple tentacles constricted about her and dragged her down; down, down, down, back into Vanity Heights.  \n‘Vile guardian’, she cried, ‘noxious saviour, foul beast, nefarious raper; first friend, now foe. Always, foe’. \nThe stench accompanying her disgrace engulfed her wholly, yet the contents of her stomach continued to emerge, again and again, onto the step where her head now resigned to lay. \n‘Never again,’ she sobbed, she promised to herself, her parents, her schoolwork. \n‘Never again,’ she promised, but Celeste’s promises were made to be broken and it was already too late. She lay shattered upon the stair case, empress turned peasant; her knight in glass armour had left her and once more she had nothing. The world around her spun, and sank, and faded to black. \n\n","title":"Vanity Heights"},"questions":[{"question":"Describe Celeste in action.

I mean that I am happy. Like, truly happy. It is all because of this tea that I drank. It is made up Chacruna Leaves and Syrian Rue.\n\nAnyway, I drank this tea, which honestly tasted like shit and made me wanna throw up for the first 30 minutes, and after about 45 or so minutes I started to laugh. I started laughing about fucking everything! I laughed about how huge my pupils were, I laughed at how small my hand looked, I laughed at the movie I was watching (it was the onion movie for those who were wondering), and I laughed at myself. I realized in that moment that I was happy. I was completely shocked at how happy I was. I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I was smiling. SMILING! This was the first time in literally a whole year that I had seen myself genuinely smile. \n\nI’m gonna get real here for a moment. I’ve had an incredibly shitty year. Literally since day one of 2018. On January 1st, I lost a very dear loved one. My grandma, to get into the spacifics. I lost my mother at a very young age, and most my contact with her family, and my grandmother became my new mother figure. I was always honest, sharing my feelings with her and telling her everything. There are so many things I wish I should have told her. When she died I went into this very deep depression. I pushed away my friends and I just stayed in bed and cried. I just wanted to die and make my feelings go away. It was fucking miserable. I can’t even describe it completely. It was the suckiest of suck I have felt in my life. \n\nAnd then, I moved. I moved 200 miles away from my hometown of Snoqualmie, Washington, a town just 40 miles west of Seattle, to Chewelah, Washington, a small town 80 miles north of Spokane. I moved away from all my friends and family, and it made me even sadder. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any suckier, it did. \n\nHowever, drinking that tea made me realize how much I worried too much. I worried too much about what other people thought of me. I worried too much about what was in my future. I just fucking hated that I worried about pointless shit. Sure, my life was shitty, but I’ve come to realize that it’s all okay. It’s okay that I felt awful, I understand how hard my life was up until this point.\n\nIt’s December 1st, fifteen days away from my 18th birthday. I think that it is finally time that I moved forward. I need to stop worrying about the past and about the future. I just need to focus on what is happening now. Stop thinking. Just do. Do it. Do what makes you happy. If you love music, start a band, fuck it! If you like writing, write! My point is, just take life at your own pace. Stop stressing over what ever it is that has you so worried. Take time out of your day to think about yourself. \n\nSure, you might want to call me names because I found happiness in drugs, but the point of my, you could call it an essay, was to make a point about that. Yes, DMT made me super fucking happy for like six hours. What I want to do from now on is find things in the real world that makes me happy. I need to stop relying on drugs. I might not quit drugs completely, seeing as how I wanna be a legal marijuana grower (because in the state of Washington you can make over $100k a year by growing weed for a cannabis company). I’ve done drugs, I’ve been there, I’ve seen things. Of all the things I’ve seen, I now know that one thing is clear. I’m happy. I’m happy because I stopped worrying.\n\nIf you managed to read this whole thing, I would like to thank you. Yes, I am speaking directly to you, the person reading this. Thank you for taking time out of your day. Thank you for listening to what I had to say. I know you must be busy. You have a life, I get it. But you actually took five minutes out of your busy life to listen to some 18 year old hippy talk about his shitty life. Thank you for caring. It’s nice that people care about things. Anyway, it’s 1:29AM right now, I should get some sleep.\n","title":"[NF] The Key to Happiness"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the issues that are making the narrator depressed.","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator is depressed because they lost their grandmother and their mother.

He was the Governor of Southeast Sulawesi for twelve years between 1966 and 1978, and held acting governor positions in four other provinces due to his position in the Ministry of Home Affairs.\n\n\nEarly life\n\nSabara was born in Kendari, then part of Dutch East Indies, on 17 February 1927. His father was a municipal police officer. Sabara was the last of seven siblings, and he began his education in Kendari before moving to Makassar for further education until 1946, where he attended school with future Indonesian nationalist figure Robert Wolter Monginsidi.[1][2][3]\n\n\nCareer\n\nMilitary service\n\nAfter completing his education in Makassar, Sabara joined a group of youths from Sulawesi who left for Java to fight in the Indonesian National Revolution, as the South Sulawesi campaign of Raymond Westerling was raging in Makassar and its vicinity.[4][5] Once in Java, Sabara joined a battalion in the nationalist government, having been before grown an interest in the military due to watching KNIL drills as a child.[6] In 1948, he was a first lieutenant in command of a reserve company which was about to be deployed to Sulawesi when his unit was attacked and disarmed by Communist militias during the Madiun Affair. Sabara was imprisoned and was apparently about to be executed before Army units from the Siliwangi Division defeated the Communists and freed Sabara's unit.[7] During his time in Java, he also enrolled in the Magelang Military Academy.[8]\n\nAfter the revolution, he commanded units within the Hasanuddin Military Region, eventually becoming commander of its Regional Training Regiment by 1965. During his time at Hasanuddin, he participated in the campaign against Andi Aziz's rebellion. He had also commanded a reserve brigade during Operation Trikora in 1962.[9][10]\n\nGovernor and civil servant\n\nOn 14 October 1966, he was appointed as acting governor of Southeast Sulawesi, before being made full governor for two terms starting in 1967.[11][12] The previous civilian governor and the first elected governor of the province, La Ode Hadi, was forced to leave his position in 1966 before he had held it for two years following a wave of demonstrations during the transition to the New Order, allowing the popular Sabara (at that time a lieutenant colonel) to take over.[13]\n\nSoutheast Sulawesi was very sparsely populated at the start of his tenure, with little to no government budget, and Sabara opted to relocate locals (mostly nomadic farmers) alongside resettlement areas where roads were planned.[14] According to Sabara in a 1983 interview with _Tempo_, his wife initially believed that his appointment to Southeast Sulawesi was an exile of sorts.[15] He also drew in migrants from densely populated Java and Bali. Despite a lack of existing traffic at the time, he lobbied for the central government to fund key roads, especially between Kendari and Kolaka, believing that the road would attract agricultural settlers.[16] During his governorship, he also served in the People's Consultative Assembly as a regional representative.[17]\n\nHe was initially intended to serve just one term, and after its expiry in 1973 a lack of replacement candidates resulted in his term initially being extended by several months, and later a second term.[18] After the conclusion of his governorship in 1978, he was assigned in 1979 to the Ministry of Home Affairs as inspector general, and later became the director general of the ministry's regional autonomy directorate.[19] During his time there, he became acting governors for Jambi (1979),[20] Central Sulawesi (25 November 1980 – 1981),[21] and Aceh (15 March – 27 August 1981),[22] During his temporary governorships of Aceh and Central Sulawesi, he had encountered political gridlocks in the provincial legislatures during their attempt to appoint a definitive governor.[23]\n\nIn 27 October 1981, he was also again appointed acting governor of Southeast Sulawesi, the eighth time he was sworn in as Governor.[24][25][26] Afterwards, he was once more appointed as acting governor of Central Kalimantan (7 October 1983 – 23 January 1984).[27] Due to this track record, he was known by journalists as being the “acting governor specialist” in the early 1980s.[28][29] During his time in the ministry, he also revived the deputy governor position, based on his own experience as governor where a lack of a deputy often caused issues especially with the provincial legislature.[30] He was awarded with the Star of Mahaputera, 3rd class (_Bintang Mahaputera Utama_) during his time as inspector general.[31] In 1984, he was also appointed into the Supreme Advisory Council.[32]\n\nHe died in September 1995, due to his heart disease and kidney-related complications. He was buried in Jakarta.[33] At the time of his death, he held the rank of major general.[34]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n\n[27] \n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] \n\n[31] \n\n[32] \n\n[33] \n\n[34] \n","title":"Eddy Sabara"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about Sabara's dictatorial tendencies?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer is empty.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"There is no answer.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"There are no direct quotes from the text about this subject.

Were times not so dire and the need for action so immediate, I would still be waiting for more information to address the nation. Unfortunately, America, that is not the case. The bald truth is this: more is unknown about this epidemic than is known. Medical professionals around the world are working tirelessly to provide answers, but as of right now, no cure or preventative mediation have shown long-term effectiveness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKnown by different names around the country – Creeping Flu, Bellows, Influenza M – the infection is spread through direct disease transmission. Simply being touched by an infected person does not cause transmission of the disease from one person to another, but an exchange of bodily fluids will. This can come from being bitten by an infected person, ingesting fluids from an infected person, or sexual contact with an infected person. I must stress… simply touching an infected person will not transmit the disease. Forced quarantine upon medical professionals based on this misinformation will only lead to further infection and unnecessary condemnation, not to mention the loss of valuable personnel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe speed of infection appears to increase with every new generation. Because of this, providing an accurate timeline for symptom progression is impossible. What we can do is provide a concrete, concise list of symptoms. Before we address this, however, it is important to note that one or two symptoms does not necessarily indicate infection. With so much confusion, stress, and exposure to new drugs, it absolutely makes sense that people would be getting sick with perfectly normal diseases. This is not the Wild West and we are not horses: a bullet is not the cure for a broken leg, nor is it the cure for the average flu. Even now, when the infection can potentially spread so quickly throughout the body, we must be sure of our decisions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, the symptoms, in order, are as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. General fatigue/weakness\n\n2. Cluster headaches: sharp, burning pain behind the left eye\n\n3. Burst blood vessels in left eye\n\n4. Quickly onset fever of above 106 degrees Fahrenheit\n\n5. Vomiting/diarrhea\n\n6. Hallucinations\n\n7. Paralysis\n\n8. Death\n\n9. Reanimation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSymptoms will appear in the order shown. No variation of symptom order has been observed, though personal susceptibility to individual symptoms may accelerate the onset of specific steps. Again, I must stress that individual symptoms do not indicate an overall infection. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, it is with a heavy heart I inform America that its military will be unable to assist at this time. Were this an invading foreign power at our nations door, the United States Armed Forces would be fully prepared to stand and defend her people. As it is, we have been found shamefully unprepared to address an epidemic of this strength and nature. For the foreseeable future, the American people will need to rely on their own grit and perseverance in order to weather this storm. This will not be the first time the mettle of the American people was tested, nor will it be the second, nor the third. America is a nation born of independence and ingenuity. A nation of adaptation and spirit. This is a fight we will win, my fellow Americans, but one that will take a heavy toll.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoubt is a rot in the heart of mankind which is easily planted by fear – one that must not be allowed to take root.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has been an honor serving you, America. Thank you, good luck, and god speed.","title":"[TH] Final Presidential Address - July 1st, 2016"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story say about symptoms that would be visible to an observer?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The response misses to mention that the symptoms are general fatigue/weakness, cluster headaches, burst blood vessels in the left eye, quickly onset fever of above 106 degrees Fahrenheit, vomiting/diarrhea, hallucinations, paralysis, and death.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is empty.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The output of this is unparsable.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer field is empty.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The article has some information about symptoms that would be visible to an observer.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":true,"new_critique":{"text":"The answer should say that symptoms like burst blood vessels in the left eye and vomiting would be visible to an observer.

Playing between 1904–1952, Chickasha teams played as members of the Southwestern League (1904), Western Association (1920–1921), Oklahoma State League (1922) and Class D Sooner State League (1948–1952).\n\n\nHistory\n\nMinor league baseball in Chickasha began when Chickasha briefly had a team in 1904. The SHAWNEE BROWNS of the Southwestern League moved to Chickasha, Oklahoma on June 30, 1904. The team became the CHICKASHA INDIANS and continued play in the Southwestern League. However, the franchise returned to Shawnee, Oklahoma on August 3, 1904. The franchise then disbanded on September 5, 1904.[1][2][3]\n\nBaseball returned in 1920, when the CHICKASHA CHICKS began play in the eight-team Western Association. The Western Association had just reformed after a two-year hiatus. Other 1920 league members were the Drumright Drummers, Enid Harvesters, Fort Smith Twins, Henryetta Hens, Okmulgee Drillers, Pawhuska Huskers and Springfield Merchants.[4][5]\n\nIn their first full season of play, the Chickasha Chicks finished 52–72 (7th) in the 1920 Western Association.[6]\n\nThe Chickasha Chicks won the 1921 Western Association Championship. The Chicks finished 74–74 (5th overall) in the regular season and captured the first-half pennant. In the playoff Finals, the Chickasha Chicks defeated the Fort Smith Twins 4 games to 3 to claim the 1921 championship.[7][8][9]\n\nChickasha left the Western Association to join the newly formed Oklahoma State League in 1922 and won their second straight championship. Other charter members of the six–team 1922 Oklahoma State League were the Clinton Bulldogs, Duncan Oilers, El Reno Railroaders, Guthrie, Oklahoma and Wilson Drillers.[10][11]\n\nPlaying in the new league in 1922, the Chickasha Chicks finished 55–55 (3rd) in the regular season. They qualified for the playoffs by winning the first half championship with a 33-17 record.[12] In the second half, however, shaky finances and dwindling attendance during a losing streak caused the team to miss payroll and forfeit several games, culminating with a league takeover of the franchise. The team was renamed the “Orphans” and forced to play its remaining schedule on the road.[13][14][15] Despite limited success over the remainder of the regular season, the team defeated the Clinton Bulldogs in the playoff finals, 4 games 0, to claim the 1922 championship.[16] After the 1922 championship season the franchise folded.[17][18]\n\nIn 1948, the Chickasha Chiefs began play in the Sooner State League. The Chiefs and Ada Herefords were expansion teams in the league as it expanded from six–teams to eight–teams after forming in 1947. The other 1948 Sooner State League members were the Ada Herefords, Ardmore Indians, Duncan Cementers, Lawton Giants, McAlester Rockets, Pauls Valley Raiders and Seminole Oilers.[19][20]\n\nChickasha qualified for the playoffs in 1948. The Chicks finished 73–63 (4th) in the regular season. In the playoffs, the McAlester Rockets defeated the Chickasha Chiefs 3 games to 1. The Chiefs 1948 attendance was 35,640, an average of 524 per game.[21][22]\n\nReturning to the playoffs in 1949, the Chickasha Chicks finished 78–61 (3rd) in the regular season. In the 1949 playoffs, the Lawton Giants defeated Chickasha 3 games to 0. The Chicks 1949 attendance was 59,306, an average of 853.[23][24]\n\nThe 1950 Chickasha Chiefs finished 80–59 (3rd) in the Sooner State League regular season. Qualifying for the playoffs, the McAlester Rockets defeated the Chiefs 3 games to 0. The 1950 season attendance was 43,759 (3rd in the league).[25][26]\n\nIn 1951, the Chickasha Chiefs used five managers in finishing 46–94 (7th) in the Sooner State League. The 1951 season attendance was 21,107.[27]\n\nThe Chickasha Chiefs returned to the Sooner State League playoffs in 1952. The Chiefs finished 78–62 (3rd) in the 1952 regular season. In the playoffs, the Pauls Valley Raiders defeated the Chickasha Chiefs 3 games to 1. Season attendance: 27,494, an average of 393.[28][29]\n\nthe Chickasha Chiefs folded after the 1952 season and were replaced by the Gainesville Owls in the 1953 Sooner State League. Chickasha hasn't hosted another minor league baseball team.[30]\n\n\nThe ballparks\n\nThe Chickasha Chiefs played at MEMORIAL PARK, also referred to as BORDEN PARK. Borden Park burned in August 1950 and was rebuilt for the following season.[31][32] The ballpark had a capacity of 1,700 (1950) and 2,500 (1952). Borden Park, which is now called Elliott Field and is used for high school baseball, was located at 200 North 19th Street.[33]\n\nFrom 1920 through May 1921, the Chickasha Chicks played at UNIVERSITY PARK.[34] University Park, which had previously hosted exhibition games featuring Hall of Fame pitcher Walter Johnson, was located at the terminus of the street railway line near present-day Shannon Springs Park.[35][36][37]\n\nIn the middle of the 1921 season, the Chicks moved to a newly constructed ballpark named GRADY FIELD. The new ballpark was located on East Choctaw Avenue, just east of the viaduct that carries that road over the railroad tracks, where the Grady County Fairgrounds are now located. University Park was demolished immediately upon completion of the new field.[38][39][40]\n\nThe 1904 Chickasha Indians played at ROCK ISLAND BALL PARK.[41] This facility was built at the site of the former Rock Island stockyards, south of the Rock Island Railroad machine shop and the Crystal Ice Company plant, on land donated by the railroad.[42][43][44][45] The location was half a block east of South First Street, along the railroad tracks between East Minnesota and East Dakota Avenues.[46]\n\n\nNotable alumni\n\n-   Ed Cole (1950)\n-   Mike Cvengros (1921)\n-   Camilo Pascual (1951) Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame\n-   Ned Pettigrew (1920, MGR)\n-   Pete Runnels (1949) 5× MLB All-Star, 2× AL batting champion (1960, 1962), Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame\n-   Guy Sturdy (1921)\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n\n[27] \n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] \n\n[31] \n\n[32] \n\n[33] \n\n[34] \n\n[35] \n\n[36] \n\n[37] \n\n[38] \n\n[39] \n\n[40] \n\n[41] \n\n[42] \n\n[43] \n\n[44] \n\n[45] \n\n[46] \n","title":"Chickasha Chiefs"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the successes of the Chickasha baseball teams.","answers":[{"answer":"The Chickasha Chiefs finished 7th in the Western Association's first full season of play in 1920.

Though challenged in recent times by rival “discounters” such as Lidl (also German-owned), Aldi achieved sales in 2009 of more than 50 billion euros worldwide.\n\nLittle is known of the private lives of the Albrecht family, but Theo’s wealth was estimated by Forbes last year at $16.7 billion, making him the 31st richest person in the world and Germany’s second richest behind Karl at $23.5 billion; the brothers fortunes combined were exceed only by those of Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and the Mexican Carlos Slim.\n\nThe Albrechts’ obsession with privacy — living behind fortress-like security on estates overlooking the Ruhr valley, rarely snapped by paparazzi, never making public statements — derived in part from Theo’s experience in December 1971, when he was kidnapped at gunpoint by Heinz-Joachim Ollenburg, a lawyer with gambling debts, and his accomplice Paul Kron. Theo was held for 17 days in Ollenburg’s Düsseldorf office, but so nondescript was his appearance — he favoured cheap, ill-fitting suits — that the kidnappers demanded to see his ID to make sure they had snatched the right man. He responded by haggling over the ransom sum, which was eventually fixed at seven million Deutschmarks, and was delivered to a highway rendezvous by the Bishop of Essen. Ollenburg and Kron were caught and jailed, but only half of the money was recovered. Albrecht went to court to claim it as a tax-deductible business expense.\n\nTheodor Paul Albrecht was born in the Schonnebeck suburb of Essen, in the industrial Ruhr region, on March 28 1922, two years after his brother Karl. Their father was a miner until emphysema rendered him an invalid; their frugal, hard-working mother ran a small food shop and, in the 1930s, the two youths sold buns around the district from a wooden cart. Both served in the German army during the war: Theo with Rommel’s Afrika Corps until he was eventually captured by US troops in Italy in 1945.\n\nWhen the brothers were released from prisoner of war camps to return to Essen they found most of the city (a major railway centre which had also been the site of Krupps munitions factories) reduced to ruins, But their mother’s house and shop was intact. They began to expand the business with other grocery outlets, experimenting with a no-frills self-service format and a limited range of merchandise. Within a decade, as Germany’s economic recovery gathered pace, they owned more than 100 stores.\n\nIn 1961 they adopted the name Aldi (a contraction of Albrecht Discount) and divided the map of Germany in half — along the so-called Aldi Equator — reportedly after disagreeing over whether or not to sell cigarettes. Theo took control of Aldi Nord, still based in Essen, while Karl, reputedly the more dynamic of the duo in their younger days, ran Aldi Sud from Essen’s sister city of Mulheim.\n\nThey later divided the rest of the world, if not quite in such a logical way: Theo’s empire expanded into France, Spain, Portugal and Poland, while Karl’s eventually reached Britain and Australia. And both brothers built operations in the United States, Karl under the Aldi banner and Theo as owner of the Trader Joe’s chain of 340 “gourmet” grocery stores that he acquired in 1979.\n\nAt home in Germany the group expanded to 4,000 stores, owned via a number of legally separate operating units which allowed the brothers to co-operate when it suited them but to circumvent laws on accounting disclosure for large businesses and to avoid having to deal with a nationwide workers’ council. They ran their operations with military discipline and attention to detail, and in such secrecy that Aldi managers were forbidden not only to talk to the press but even to talk to their own colleagues in other districts.\n\nGrowth was funded out of retained profits rather than public capital-raising, and success was achieved by offering no more than a few hundred well-chosen product lines (rather than the tens of thousands found in other supermarkets) at low prices made possible by massive purchasing. This was combined with a high ratio of sales per square metre of floor space, and ferocious cost control — the latter being Theo’s special skill.\n\nLittle money was wasted on marketing, and none at all on making Aldi stores look elegant: goods were simply piled up along the aisles in packing cases. Theo himself made a point of using pencil stubs rather than expensive pens. Asked to approve the plans for a new outlet in Holland, he replied that the design was good but the paper it was drawn on was too thick: “If you use thinner paper we will save money.”\n\nA devout Roman Catholic, Theo Albrecht retired from the day-to-day running of the business in 1993, but remained active as chairman of the foundation that is Aldi Nord’s principal shareholder. He is survived by his wife Cilli, their sons Theo Jr and Berthold, who hold management positions in Aldi, and his brother Karl, now 90.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about privacy?","answers":[{"answer":"The Albrecht family is known for their obsession with privacy.

Thomas watched in horror as the soccer ball smashed into the tennis trophies. His eyes filled with tears as he looked at the pile of broken pieces on the floor, and his voice was almost a whisper when he asked, \"Why did you do that?\"  \n\"Because you never play with me!\"  \n\"I said later.\"  \n\"You always say later! And then you just stare at your stupid trophies all day!\"  \nThomas looked at his son. Michael defiantly looked back.  \n\"Go to your room.\", he said.  \nMichael didn't move.   \n\"Now.\", Thomas added.  \nMichael kept his posture for another moment, then he drooped and started shuffling to the hall, closing the door behind himself. Thomas took a deep breath and his gaze rested on the door for a moment. Then he fetched some glue from the utility drawer and sat down next to the pile of broken trophies. Most of them weren't too badly damaged. Some bumps and scratches, two of them had snapped at the base. He picked up the trophy for the first place in the municipal championships. The two golden tennis player figurines that once stood proudly on top of it were now lying on the ground. The trophy for second place at the regional charity tournament got the worst of it. It was made of two engraved glass blocks, and it was shattered into a couple dozen pieces. Thomas sighed. He took the largest piece of the glass trophy and started looking for matching pieces.\n\nThomas didn't know how much time had passed, but he realized that the afternoon sun had all but disappeared behind the horizon when Michael opened the door to the living room.  \n\"I'm hungry.\"  \nThomas looked up from the trophy. He had managed to reassemble most of the pieces, but the cracks and seams were very visible on the smooth surface. He paused for a moment.  \n\"Then make yourself some food.\"  \n\"No you make some!\", Michael said, helplessly waving his arms and stomping his feet. Thomas was still squatting in front of the trophy pile, his head at the same level as Michael's.  \n\"You hurt me very much, Michael.\", Thomas said. \"Just make yourself a sandwich. I really don't feel like cooking for you right now.\"  \n\"I hate you!\", Michael exploded, and ran towards Thomas and shoved him with all the weight he could bring up with his eight year old body. Thomas lost his balance and rolled on his back. Michael picked up the almost repaired glass trophy.  \n\"And I hate your stupid trophies!\"  \nThomas was horrified. \"No!\", he shouted, way too late.  \nMichael threw the trophy at the wall, where it shattered into a million pieces.  \nThomas couldn't hold back his anger anymore. \"Enough!\" He grabbed Michael and put him over his shoulder.  \nHe carried him to his room, while Michael kept struggling and kicking and throwing his little fists at Thomas' back. He put him down on his bed, stood up and looked down at him, pointing his finger.  \n\"You stay here now! I don't want to see you again until I've cleaned up your mess! Understood?\"  \nMichael looked at his feet and nodded weakly.\n\nThomas had to accept that there was no way he would reassemble the countless shards into which the trophy had shattered. He grabbed a scoop and a hand brush and started sweeping up the shards. When he was done, he repaired the other, less severely damaged trophies and placed them back onto the shelf. Only the municipal championships trophy was still incomplete. One of the two figurines was missing. \n\nThomas was sitting at the kitchen table and had just started to quarter and peel an apple when Michael carefully opened the door and entered.  \n\"I'm sorry I broke your trophies.\", he said. His eyes were red and wet from crying.\nThomas looked at Michael with his mouth open, as it finally made sense.  \n\"They're not just my trophies, Michael.\", he said. \"Your mom and I won those together. That's why they are so important to me. They remind me of her.\"  \nMichael looked up at his father, new tears shooting into his eyes as he realized what he had done.  \n\"I miss her.\", he wept.  \n\"I miss her too.\", Thomas said.  \nThomas got up and took the municipal championships cup from the shelf.  \n\"This was the last tournament we played in.\", he said. \"Your mom was already two months pregnant with you when we won this.\"  \n\"Why did you stop playing?\", Michael asked.  \n\"We didn't stop playing tennis.\", Thomas replied. \"We just stopped playing in tournaments. It just didn't seem important anymore.\"  \nMichael thought about that for a moment while Thomas finished peeling the apple. He handed a piece to Michael. They both took a bite and looked each other in the eyes. Michael hesitated for a moment, then he reached into his pocket and took out the missing figurine.  \n\"I took it.\", he said. \"I'm sorry.\"  \nThomas stared at the golden figurine.  \n\"Then let's reattach it.\", he said as he got up and fetched the glue. He carefully applied a little glue while Michael held the figurine. Then he gently led Michael's hand as he put the figurine back in place. They exchanged a deep look. Nobody said a word.  \n\"Can we have Pasta now?\", Michael said.  \nThomas laughed, and realized that he was happy.

With them, me. I stood up on the white sanded beach and looked out into the great blue yonder. The water was so blue and clear, I could've sworn I was in the Bahamas. A moment later, I smelled iron. \"Blood\" I thought. I ripped off my white cotton dress shirt and saw the the blood oozing out of the deep lacerations on my torso. Then, the smelled of something being grilled filled the air. \"There's someone else on the island.\n   I ran to the smell as fast as humanly possible. It was the most difficult thing I've ever done. I ran so fast my muscles started to hurt. I tripped over rocks and branches multiple times which exacerbated the lacerations. When I got to the barbecue all I saw were servants and a woman in a red dress. She was no older than me, twenty. After looking around, I collapsed.\n   The next thing I remember, I was in a huge cave. Except, it didn't look like a cave. It looked like a regular home. I opened my eyes and saw the immaculate kitchen, it was like one you'd see in a five star restaurant. Annexed off the kitchen, there was a beautiful dining room. However, I got the feeling that it was just collecting dust. I was laying on a black couch big enough for two people and was snuggled up in a flannel blanket. I wanted to get up but I debated if it was worth losing the warmth. It was decided, I'd get up. As I got up, I heard a woman say \"Woah, easy there\".\n   She was the most beautiful woman in the world. She was like something out of a Greek mythology tale. She had long dark brown hair braided to the side, warm brown eyes, and smelled like honeysuckle. She looked very Mediterranean. For example, she had olive skin and strong facial features. Her voice was soft and when she talked, it sounded like angles were singing. If I didn't know any better, I'd say she was Aphrodite.\n     \"What's your name,\" I asked.\n     \"I am Calypso and you are on Ogygia\" she smiled. \"After we eat, you can go home if you'd like\".\n     \"Can I think about it\" I said looking at the island.\n     \"Sure,\" she smiled. \"Now go back to sleep, you need rest\".\n     A moment later, my eyes were closed.\n     \n                    *****\n  When I opened my eyes, I saw her smiling over me, her teeth were pure white.

The only source of light were the stars and the moon. Since there was no light pollution, you could see the faintest stars. It was beautiful. On the white beach there was a blanket and several baskets.\n    \"It's a beautiful out here. Is it like this every night?\" I said looking up at the stars.\n    \"Yes it is \" she smiled while looking up at the stars.\n    The baskets had everything in them. Literally, you could think of food or drink and you'd have it. After dinner, we walked on the shores.\n   \"Will you stay with me?\" She asked. I could hear a hint of nervousness in her voice.\n   I thought about my life in the real world. I had no family, no friends, and no money. I had nothing.

It is made up Chacruna Leaves and Syrian Rue.\n\nAnyway, I drank this tea, which honestly tasted like shit and made me wanna throw up for the first 30 minutes, and after about 45 or so minutes I started to laugh. I started laughing about fucking everything! I laughed about how huge my pupils were, I laughed at how small my hand looked, I laughed at the movie I was watching (it was the onion movie for those who were wondering), and I laughed at myself. I realized in that moment that I was happy. I was completely shocked at how happy I was. I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I was smiling. SMILING! This was the first time in literally a whole year that I had seen myself genuinely smile. \n\nI’m gonna get real here for a moment. I’ve had an incredibly shitty year. Literally since day one of 2018. On January 1st, I lost a very dear loved one. My grandma, to get into the spacifics. I lost my mother at a very young age, and most my contact with her family, and my grandmother became my new mother figure. I was always honest, sharing my feelings with her and telling her everything. There are so many things I wish I should have told her. When she died I went into this very deep depression. I pushed away my friends and I just stayed in bed and cried. I just wanted to die and make my feelings go away. It was fucking miserable. I can’t even describe it completely. It was the suckiest of suck I have felt in my life. \n\nAnd then, I moved. I moved 200 miles away from my hometown of Snoqualmie, Washington, a town just 40 miles west of Seattle, to Chewelah, Washington, a small town 80 miles north of Spokane. I moved away from all my friends and family, and it made me even sadder. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any suckier, it did. \n\nHowever, drinking that tea made me realize how much I worried too much. I worried too much about what other people thought of me. I worried too much about what was in my future. I just fucking hated that I worried about pointless shit. Sure, my life was shitty, but I’ve come to realize that it’s all okay. It’s okay that I felt awful, I understand how hard my life was up until this point.\n\nIt’s December 1st, fifteen days away from my 18th birthday. I think that it is finally time that I moved forward. I need to stop worrying about the past and about the future. I just need to focus on what is happening now. Stop thinking. Just do. Do it. Do what makes you happy. If you love music, start a band, fuck it! If you like writing, write! My point is, just take life at your own pace. Stop stressing over what ever it is that has you so worried. Take time out of your day to think about yourself. \n\nSure, you might want to call me names because I found happiness in drugs, but the point of my, you could call it an essay, was to make a point about that. Yes, DMT made me super fucking happy for like six hours. What I want to do from now on is find things in the real world that makes me happy. I need to stop relying on drugs. I might not quit drugs completely, seeing as how I wanna be a legal marijuana grower (because in the state of Washington you can make over $100k a year by growing weed for a cannabis company). I’ve done drugs, I’ve been there, I’ve seen things. Of all the things I’ve seen, I now know that one thing is clear. I’m happy. I’m happy because I stopped worrying.\n\nIf you managed to read this whole thing, I would like to thank you. Yes, I am speaking directly to you, the person reading this. Thank you for taking time out of your day. Thank you for listening to what I had to say. I know you must be busy. You have a life, I get it. But you actually took five minutes out of your busy life to listen to some 18 year old hippy talk about his shitty life. Thank you for caring. It’s nice that people care about things. Anyway, it’s 1:29AM right now, I should get some sleep.\n","title":"[NF] The Key to Happiness"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the issues that are making the narrator depressed.","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator has had a very shitty year.

Rosa already knew that she did, but she was trying to get a better price. It wasn’t there yet, so she shrugged and turned her head away nonchalantly.\n\nThe salesman looked at her. Rosa Berger was attractive, and meeting her at the beach was her idea. He now knew why. She dressed in a bikini that had to be pushing the limits of any decency laws in the area. She was lying on a towel, sunning herself, looking like a model in a magazine. He was having trouble concentrating. His usual clientele were quite a bit older and more prudish. But she knew what she was looking for. He had a feeling she knew how to buy it, too.\n\n“What do you want from me? This is not an easy find. I can’t go lower.” He tried, but he knew she was breaking him.\n\nRosa sat up and placed a hand in between her breasts, drawing the salesman’s eyes to them. She smiled when she noticed his face become far redder than what it should be for as little as he’s been in the sun. “I just can’t work that. It’s really important for my family to have this piece, but there’s only so much we can do ourselves. Are you sure you can’t drop the price? Even a little?”\n\nThe salesman barely heard what she was saying. “N-name your price. We, uh, we can go from there.” He struggled to take his eyes off her chest.\n\nThe dark haired beauty took off her sunglasses and looked her “victim” in the eyes. Her gorgeous brown eyes looked full of innocent joy at the news, and she knew right then and there that she had him hook, line, and sinker. She damn near could have asked him to just give her the artifact for free and he would have done it.\n\nSometimes, Rosa felt bad for the sellers of her trinkets, but they almost always tried to oversell them. Probably usually got away with it with the older codgers who were trying to keep busy in their old age. She, on the other hand, knew what investing in those beauties was worth. Those objects told the story of the past. This is where we, as the human race, came from. This wasn’t some text in a history book from high school. This was the real deal. This was magic to Rosa, a way to view the past.\n\nThere was nothing more important.\n\n“Really?” Rosa reached into her beach bag and grabbed a pad of Post-Its and a pen, wrote down her price, and handed it too him, surreptitiously getting into the sexiest pose she knew. The salesman was now clearly and uncomfortably aroused and at this point, Rosa knew by experience, he would say yes to the deal just to get out of the awkward situation.\n\nThe salesman briefly looked at the note, sighed, knowing full well that in normal situations he would never dare accept the offer, and handed it back. “Fine.”\n\n“Yay!” Rosa exclaimed, keeping up the appearance that she was innocent. She again reached into her beach bag and grabbed her checkbook, filled it out for the amount she asked about, and handed it to the man. He grabbed it, opened up his briefcase, grabbed the object, handed it to Rosa, and quickly said his goodbyes, practically running to get away from her.\n\nRosa giggled to herself. She put the object into her beach bag and continued to sun herself, eventually falling asleep.\n\nWhen she heard rustling, she awoke to find someone digging through her bag. She was short, blonde and wearing a jogging outfit of short shorts and a sports bra. As soon as Rosa sat up, the blond woman stood up with the object in hand and ran away. Rosa realized the thief knew exactly what she was after; she wasn’t just some trash stealing some other woman’s junk.\n\nRosa jumped up and followed the woman. She was good at running on the sand and had trained herself to run barefoot on nearly any surface. So when the jogger ran onto the pavement, the fact that all Rosa was wearing was a very skimpy bikini didn’t bother her. She was going to get that object back.\n\nIt seemed, however, that thief was just as athletic as Rosa. She ran through cars and buildings. Rosa was just a little faster and was catching up with her, until the jogger displayed a skill that Rosa did not have: free running. She ran into an alley full of junk that would slow down normal people, but she just jumped and flipped over whatever she needed to and sped far ahead of Rosa.\n\nBut Rosa was resourceful. There was an idling motorcycle nearby that the beautiful artifact collector had no qualms about “borrowing.” She jumped on it and took off around the block in hopes of catching the thief off guard.\n\nWhen she rounded the corner, there was a little traffic and the blonde was just coming out of the alley. Rosa wove in and out to catch up. The jogger ran down another alley, this one clear. Rosa followed on the bike. The thief ran down another side alley, this one ended in a dead end with a overfilled dumpster.\n\nRosa sped up and, being so focused on her enemy, missed the brick laying on the ground in front of her. She flew off the bike as it flipped. Luckily she landed on the blond runner. Unfortunately, they both fell on the pile of garbage bags.\n\nStill, Rosa wasn’t about to let her get away. She pulled her up and punched her square in the jaw. Something else she trained herself in: mixed martial arts. The thief wasn’t too bad either. She got up and took a stance that proved she knew how to fight. She gave a high kick to Rosa, who easily blocked and countered it with a punch in the upper thigh, which would definitely bruise. The runner managed to hit with an uppercut. Rosa kicked the other woman in the shin, followed by an elbow in the gut, then one in the face, landing square on the nose. This left the thief dazed enough for Rosa to one more punch in the exact same spot.\n\nThe blond jogger fell straight back, not even trying to break her fall. When Rosa checked, she had no pulse and her eyes were rolled back in her head. She was dead.\n\nRosa checked her for her prize and, finding it, moved the corpse to the dumpster burying her in bags. She found a mostly clean rag and wiped the bike clean of any evidence of her from it. She casually walked back out the alley, taking another path. Then back to the beach. Luckily, no one bothered her stuff. She put the artifact in her bag, then put the bag in her car. She then went back and finished sunning herself, as if she were perfectly fine with killing someone, as if she had done it before.\n\nBecause she had. There was nothing more important to her than the artifacts and the stories they told.","title":"[AA] The Bikini Chase"},"questions":[{"question":"How did Rosa lose the artifacts in the first place?","answers":[{"answer":"The text does not say.","critiques":[{"critique":"There is no evidence to suggest that Rosa did lose the artifact.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is implied in the text.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"\"The text does not say\" - this statement is wrong.

He had a look of anticipation, as if he was waiting for some pain relieving gossip. \n\n“I was home,” I responded innocently before he rolled his eyes at me. “Now, don’t bother me, I’m trying to focus.” Although normally I would use anything to distract me from school, I wasn’t about to involve Max in last night’s mess.\n\n“Are you expecting me to believe you weren’t at Nina’s party?” He raised his eyebrows at me. I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me. Perhaps I couldn’t fix her parent’s divorce, but I could at least attend her house party. Especially after her break up with Todd, the leather jacket douche that called her “babe” so much I would wonder if he knew her real name.\n\n“I promise you’ll have a great time,” Nina had told me. And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle. Something nostalgic about repetitive rap songs preaching about the wonders of big asses. \n\nEverything seemed normal at first. The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room. I could feel the air thickening. \n\nMinutes before terror, I was standing unnoticed next to a group of girls I recognized. \n\n“Someone told me her dad was abusive,” I heard one say with wide eyes. \n\n“Yeah, apparently the neighbors called the cops on them,” another responded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t point fingers just yet. Nina’s mom’s a bitch. Maybe she deserved it,” a brunette shrugged and took a sip of her drink right before our eyes met. Her face flared red as she realized her words had been overhead. I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry. A millisecond later, I spotted Nina on the floor. Hands covering her face in defense. The lack of light in the room didn’t stop the fierceness of her blood as it dripped down her temple and into her hair. \n\nI stood still. My brain called in fear but my body made no response. Not even when Todd walked passed me, into the hallway and shut the door behind him. \n\nNina remained on the floor. She held herself and rocked back and forth, letting silent cries out into the thick air. \n\n“Don’t tell anyone.” She whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” Max snapped at me. “Are you going to tell me or not?” I stared at him blankly as the vivid flashbacks flew through my head.

While the list does not embargo dealings with these entities, it requires American companies to treat them with caution. U.S. suppliers can no longer use existing licences to sell them products or service installed equipment, but have to reapply for new ones. San'an Optoelectronics is also the world's biggest LED chipmaker by revenue and listed in Shanghai.\n\nXi'an Jiaotong University, one of China's top 15 colleges, and a unit of Chinese Academy of Sciences, the country's top research agency, are also Applied Materials customers named on the unverified list, which was published on April 11, a supply chain source familiar with the move said. Some 37 Chinese companies and research institutions were named on the list, as well as seven organizations in Hong Kong, four in the United Arab Emirates, two in Malaysia and one in Indonesia.\n\nThe U.S. government's move marks another setback to the companies and research institutions who are crucial to China's ambitions to become a global tech superpower.\n\nApplied Materials supplies almost all the world's leading semiconductor and panel manufacturers. Market leaders such as Intel, Samsung Electronics, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, and China's national display champion BOE Technology Group could not make products without the company's tool and services.\n\nAs an industry leader in advanced tools for the critical semiconductor industry, Applied Materials' decision to immediately stop all business with those on the list could influence other U.S. vendors, as well as those outside the country, industry sources told Nikkei.\n\nOn April 12, Applied Materials sent a notice to all staff involved with the named companies that they should \"immediately stop all pending and future equipment delivery, and cease all service activities at their sites,\" according to the notice obtained by Nikkei. The U.S. chip tool giant also demanded that staff, contractors and other personnel immediately withdraw from the sites of those companies, the notice said.\n\nThe notice warned that failure to follow this compliance could lead to significant violations of U.S. trade law.\n\nThe company's actions come just weeks after Applied Materials' CEO Gary Dickerson traveled to China in late March to attend SEMICON China, one of the industry's biggest events and an important showcase for Chinese technology ever since Beijing made chip industry development a top policy priority in 2014.\n\nAt the event, Dickerson made his first clear and public statement about the U.S.-China trade tensions which have hit the chip industry hard. \"The strained relationship between China and the U.S. can put decades of economic growth at risk,\" Dickerson said. He also warned it would be \"a lose-lose proposition\" if the world's two biggest economic powers were unable to get along.\n\nApplied Materials generated some 26% of its revenue from China, its biggest market, in the most recent quarter ending Jan. 27. The U.S. company did not immediately respond to a request for comments. San'an also did not respond to the request for comments.\n\nChina's commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng last week hit back at the new unverified list, saying the U.S. move could harm Chinese companies' reputation and disrupt normal trade activities. Beijing said it objected to the abuse of national security and export control rules and demanded the U.S. withdraw the new curbs as soon as possible.\n\nAkin Gump, an international law firm, warned companies in a research note that they would have to respond to the requirements of the unverified list. \"As a result of this development, U.S. and non-U.S. companies and others should update their internal control program screens to ensure compliance with the new requirements,\" the research note said.\n\nHarry Clark, a partner with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP in Washington, told Nikkei that being added to the unverified list does not mean a broad ban on U.S. exports and re-exports to the entity, but it would need to obtain extra licences and file additional reports if dealing with such entities. It also applies to foreign persons.\n\n\"My firm advises clients to be especially careful to ensure that any export or re-export involving an unverified list entity is scrupulously compliant with the regulation,\" Clark said.\n\n_Nikkei staff writer Lauly Li contributed to this report._\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What is the purpose of the U.S red flag list?","answers":[{"answer":"The U.S red flag list gives companies the option to continue business with named entities, or disassociate from any dealings with them, albeit after additional paperwork, licenses, and reports.","critiques":[{"critique":"Precisely, this seems to be a conversational summary, which could be omitted.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The list doesn't give companies any option to continue business with named entities.

Viking Press published it within the United States in 2018,[1] while Allen Lane published it within the United Kingdom.\n\nDovetailing with Roberts' previous work on the Second World War and its related major figures, examples being _The Storm of War_, the book received praise from a number of publications. Reviewers have viewed the one-volume biography as one of the best works on Winston Churchill, a statesman best known for serving as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during the Second World War, and have particularly cited the use of newly available documentary material by Roberts in its writing.\n\nSpecifically, positive reviews appeared in the publications _City Journal_,[2] _The Jewish Chronicle,_[3] _National Review_,[4] and _The Sunday Times_.[5]\n\n\nBackground and contents\n\n[Churchill is photographed as a Member of Parliament in 1904.]\n\nGiven the author's longstanding history of writing about the early 20th century, one commentator opined that “Churchill’s world and its environs have been so richly and perspicaciously documented by Roberts for decades that the real oddity would be his reaching the end of a fruitful career as a historian of vast events and great men with no” single work on the figure being published. In preparation for the book, Roberts accessed newly open material previously unavailable to earlier writers. For example, the private diary kept by King George VI during World War II became as a resource given Queen Elizabeth II's assent for its use for historical posterity.[6]\n\nRoberts describes Churchill's background and particularly notes the sadness that Churchill experienced as a child. Ignored by his active father and subject to an uncompassionate mother, Roberts writes, the young Churchill grows up in a general atmosphere of loneliness, despite his multiple attempts to write to his parents.[7] While born into an aristocratic family at Blenheim Palace, the complex being built an illustrious duke ancestor, Churchill lamented missed opportunities and particularly felt pressured given his half-American and half-British parentage, with his mother and her relatives dismissed as crass upstarts. Roberts argues that the issues endured in Churchill's childhood endowed the statesman with a strong sense of personal character possibly unlikely to have come about were Churchill either all British or a complete American expatriate.[8]\n\nServing in the First World War gave Churchill the opportunity to live out his taste for glory, according to Roberts. Churchill particularly wrote to Margot Asquith in 1915 that he “would not be out of this glorious, delicious war for anything.”[9] The statesmen's early life involves a variety of military and journalistic triumphs as well as certain misadventures in different nations such as Cuba, India, and South Africa, Roberts writes, that leads Churchill into the British Parliament at age twenty-five.[10] As an example of how Churchill's psychology became shaped by varied experiences, Roberts cites the experience of dealing with Islamic fundamentalist militants as a young soldier on India's northwest frontier as preparation to understand Adolf Hitler's fanaticism.[11]\n\nAs a young man, Churchill developed a particular type of personality involving a certain psychological foresight as well as an exaggerated sense of ideals and general life purposes, according to Roberts. The author describes Churchill's photographic memory and notes that, while the statesman bemoaned the inability to achieve an advanced higher education, this allowed for Churchill to become a self-educated master of the English language, particularly works of poetry. Roberts condemns what he sees as later misinterpretations of Churchill's background and psyche, the author remarking that Churchill is best thought of as both a dreamer and as an ambitious man of his time.[12]\n\n\nReception\n\nJournalist Stephen Pollard wrote for _The Jewish Chronicle_ lauding the “simply wonderful book”, praising Roberts for having written something so “stirring yet thought-provoking” that it constituted “the most superb one-volume biography I have ever read— of anyone.” Pollard additionally remarked that since “Roberts manages something” previously “thought impossible” in creating “a new, ground-breaking portrait of the man whom many consider to be the greatest ever Englishman”, _Churchill: Walking with Destiny_ “will be regarded as a classic for generations to come”.[13] _National Review_ published a supportive review by commentator Tracy Lee Simmons. Praising the “massive book”, Simmons stated that Roberts had managed “a tour de force of scrupulous selection and astute appraisal” that stands out “in a field where the competition has been crowded and stiff.”[14]\n\nAdditional praise has come from publications such as _The Sunday Times_, the newspaper's review stating that Roberts' style “bursts with character” and “humour”.[15] Historian Barry Strauss wrote for _City Journal_ that the “brilliant” work “is not only learned and sagacious but also thrilling and fun”. Strauss additionally commented, “Roberts writes with authority and confidence.”[16]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n","title":"Churchill: Walking with Destiny"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about the Second World War?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The book discusses Churchill's experience during the Second World War, including his strong connection with the UK and dealing with Islamic fundamentalist militants\n\nRevise the answer to reflect those aspects of Churchill's experience.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer should mention Churchill's role in the Second World War.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer is empty.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer to this question is not provided in the article.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The article does mention the Second World War.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[0,1,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"Why is Andrew Roberts uniquely successful with this book?","answers":[{"answer":"He is uniquely successful with this book because he is one of the best authorities on Churchill, and his previous books on the Second World War were very acclaimed.

A fire started on the other side of the door, inside the Gurdwara Sahib.\n\nWhile the fire damage is limited, it caused extensive internal smoke damage, including inside the Divan hall. Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji was not in Parkash (but in Sachkhand) at the time of the attack.\n\nShortly after attack, a passer-by who was familiar with Edinburgh sangat alerted the Granthi Singhs to the fire. Both the police and fire brigade arrived within minutes, along with members of Edinburgh sangat.\n\nLocal sevadaars were able to carry out a brief inspection before the police sealed off the Gurdwara Sahib for forensic analysis, but they could not determine much as it was still dark. In this time, a sevadaar rushed upstairs to Sachkhand to check Mahraaj’s Saroops which thankfully appear not to have suffered any damage. Galab Singh, a committee member of the Gurdwara Sahib said: _‘When I heard there was a fire I had to rush here and go upstairs to check Mahraaj’s saroops with my own eyes. I’m quite surprised at this attack, the Gurdwara Sahib enjoys a good relationship with the local community here.’_\n\nPolice officers are now inspecting the Gurdwara Sahib, and have taken away the petrol canister for forensic examination. The Gurdwara Sahib is hoping to update sangat once the police have finished investigating.\n\nDetective Inspector Clark Martin from Gayfield CID said: _“Fortunately, the fire was extinguished relatively quickly and no on was injured, but nevertheless we are treating this incident with the utmost seriousness._\n\n_“Anyone who remembers seeing any suspicious activity around the temple, or in the Sheriff Brae area during the early hours of Tuesday morning should contact police immediately._\n\n_“In addition, anyone with any further information relevant to this investigation is also asked to come forward.”_\n\nInspector Andrew Johnson from Leith Police Station said that police would be having a ‘high-visibility presence’ in the area while the investigation continues.\n\nDespite some reports to the contrary, Police Scotland have confirmed that NO arrests have yet been made.\n\nThe timing of the incident is of interest to the police: usually, arson attacks such as this come in the aftermath of domestic terror attacks, at a time of heightened backlash against minority communities. Moreover, the fact that the attack occurred in the early morning rather than late at night is a further indication of premeditation.\n\nKulbear Singh, President of the Edinburgh Sikh Gurdwara, said: _“Scotland’s Sikh community places an emphasis on contributing positively to society and prides itself as a vital part of a modern, multicultural Scotland. As such, hateful occurrences such as this are incredibly disheartening. The gurdwara is the place of sanctuary and learning. We come here every week with our family and children; it is frightening that someone would target us in this way.”_\n\nMembers of Edinburgh sangat have received numerous messages and gestures of support, both from the local community and national Sikh sangat. Local businesses near the Gurdwara Sahib have offered their CCTV recordings to assist the investigation.\n\nThe Church of Scotland has issued a statement expressing sympathy and solidarity with the Sikh community. The Right Rev Susan Brown, moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, said: _“How sad that a place of worship should be the target of such a hateful act._\n\n_“I am glad no one was injured and extend sympathy to the Sikh community in Edinburgh._\n\n_“We recognise the actions of a small minority do not reflect the good relations that exist with your local community. There is no room in Scotland for intolerance.”_\n\nSikh PA will bring further updates as they come from the Gurdwara Sahib and Police Scotland.

You have to realize that this year was significant as how we contacted our friends. We were at the start of the mobile generation. People my age, 16 at the time, did not have mobile phones unless their parents were rich, mine weren’t and even if they were, my friends didn’t have mobile phones. So to contact friends you would call to their house and ask their parents if they are present. If not, you would probably have to search for them at spots they might be at.\n\n----------\n\nIt's the last Friday evening of summer holiday. I had received my student travel card (free travel in public transport) earlier that day and even though I hadn’t planned anything that evening, I decide to catch a train and try to find my friends who live in a city nearby. I grab my bike, light up a spliff and head of to the train station. At this time of evening, there aren't much people at the station. I'm glad because smoking weed makes me paranoid sometimes. It makes me feel as if people are staring.\n\nAs I enter the train, the sun has already set and the absence of most of the moon, because of the time of the month, makes it darker than usual. As the train starts to leave I get the sudden urge to get out. Is it the weed that drives me or some outside force? I don’t know why but I lost the interest of visiting my friends that evening. So I get out at the next station and head for the platform for the return train. I’m the only one there.\n\nAs I light a cigarette and just sit there with not much to distract me other than my thoughts, I notice a girl is passing me by. A beautiful girl with long black curly hair and large dark eyes. I can see that she has been crying, because of the red and puffy eyes. She looks middle-eastern to me. Young, probably just a little older than me. She is wearing a white summer dress. Not tight but it outlines her butcheeks by the way she is standing. Her back shows just enough skin and my teenage hormones are starting to rage. I can only imagine the things I want to do to her before I awaken from my thoughts. I hear the rumbling of the train and see the girl standing on the edge of the platform, about 60 feet away from me. It’s dark, but the lanterns shine bright enough for me to see that her shoulders are shaking a bit. I hear a faint cry. I realize what is about to take place.\nI need to act. I do not want to see her organs all over the place, nor do I want to be stuck there for hours. There is nothing heroic about this, I am just thinking about my own interests. Might she even go down on me? My hormones still rage. I walk to her, she hasn’t noticed me yet. She jumps on the tracks. \n\nAt this point my focus shifts. I hear no sound but see everything so clear. Because of the bright lights of the incoming train I can’t estimate the distance but it looks like I can make it. My heart skips a beat. I jump on the tracks and pick her up as if she weighs nothing. The fabric of her dress is so thin it feels like I am toughing her skin. I don't want to let go, I want to keep my hands on her. So soft. I lift her on the platform and jump on there just in time as I feel the warm summer wind of the passing train. It was too close. Sound returns and I hear the ear deafening sound of shrieking brakes on the train. The girl is crying frantically. She speaks English with a thick accent: “I don’t want to live, I don’t want to live, why, why?”. I realize I can’t help her. What do I know of her problems? I’m just a 16 year old horny boy with a pretty easy life. I don’t understand her pain. I decide to hug her, my hands on her waist. She feels warm. The only reason she doesn't feel my excitement against her belly is because she is in shock. The train engineer is suddenly standing behind me and asks \"Do you need help?\" I let go as I realize he is talking to her. He walks to the girl. She clearly doesn’t want to be helped and runs off. The engineer turns to me: “Thanks. I don’t know what else to say, just thanks.” I realize why. I can see his eyes are watery and just say: “No problem, mind if I get in?” I ask because this is the intercity that isn’t supposed to stop at this train station. He doesn’t mind. I get in the (nearly empty) train and after a minute the train conductor joins me. He sits down and stays silent for half a minute as he looks at me. He thanks me for preventing a ruined weekend. His daughter is going to celebrate her 4th birthday. He wanted me to know that. I don't understand why he tells me. He hands me a flyer about how to contact some -help after trauma- center. I throw it away, I don’t need help.\n\nFast forward 3 weeks. School has started. It’s a new school for me by the way.

Night terrors that come like gut wrenching earthquakes, born from the depths of the closet. \n\n“Oh Lord, the closet,” the lady says as she is shaken from her thoughts. She keeps a kiddy night light that she bought from Walmart, a Little Mermaid themed nighty to keep the room more innocent, in the plug across from the bed. This way, when she wakes from a nightmare she can be sure that she is alone in the room, except for Ariella the Nighty of course. \n\nTonight was no exception to her ritual. She went to the kitchen and grabbed a cold beer, opened her immense medicine cabinet and fiddled with the cap of Valium until she got it open, turned on the hot water in the bathtub, and then poured in the Dove’s bubble bath. As she waited, she looked into the full-length mirror across from the tub. \n\nOver the past year, her hair has seen grey strands accompany her otherwise brown hair, and dark purple bags have appeared under her eyes. Her skin, which she used to pride her 56 year-old self on being so smooth, has turned white and wrinkled. Her belly is plump from the nightly beers and her face has become slightly gaunt. She looks as if she has aged ten years in the past one, no doubt due to the stress of her nightmares, the alcohol, and drugs. \n\nStaring at herself is a reminder of her fear and fills her with dread. Quickly, she pops open the Bud and washes down her pill. If anything can stop the self-shaming and fear, it’s her Happy Pills. She turned off the hot water, kept a little too hot so getting in would take her mind off of the real issue (although she would never admit this to herself) and slowly stepped into the tub. \n\nAfter her bath, she got into her robe and went to her bed. She dropped the robe, exposing her breasts to Ariella the Nighty, and climbed into bed with her back to the closet. At this point, she tried to think of everything besides what’s in the closet. \n\n“I wonder if Betsy got those pain meds for her husband?”\n \n“I need to cut the grass tomorrow and get the weed out of the garden...”\n\n“The new neighbors across the street really need to get a hold of their rowdy kids, always throwing their football into my yard...”\n\nOn and on the superficial thoughts go, but always, like some inevitable storm creeping in, the thought of the closet comes back. The closet’s glare feels piercing to the lady’s back. \n\n“I can’t sleep with you here,” she whispers. “I can’t sleep with you in there.” Her voice is barely audible.\n\nHer feet begin to tingle as the fear creeps in. She’s momentarily frozen to her bed. Knowing what she has to do, she makes herself sit up. She pulls the blanket down off of her hot, baking legs, and swings them down onto the floor. She takes a deep breath, exhales slowly, musters her courage and stands. \n\nShe doesn’t move, bute stares deeply and coldly at the closet door. \n\n“You got me again, you bastard.”\n\nShe takes a small step toward the closet, unable to to resist its unending call. A car drives by blaring music, hip-hop, but she is numb to the world. Nothing else exists. Just the old, deteriorating woman and her closet that won’t let her sleep, won’t let her have peace, and haunts her mind and imprisons her thoughts. \n\nShe takes another small step to the door and kicks an empty beer can. She doesn’t notice. Another step. Another. The steps seem endless until she finally reaches the closet door. \n\n“This is what you’ve been wanting,” she mumbles. \n\nHer fear gives way to anger. Blinding rage. Anger at the sleepless nights. Anger because her life has been taken from her and given to this monster that feeds on her.\n\n“Fuck you! Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!” she screams as she swings the closet door open as hard as she can. The door hits the big toe on her right foot, breaking her toenail and making it bleed, but she doesn’t notice. Her eyes are wide open, ready to face the beast that holds her hostage. Her brow is furrowed, mouth a small slit, she is ready to fight, ready to rid herself of the monster. She makes contact with the beast’s eyes, and he stares right back into hers. \n\nOn the bottom of the otherwise empty closet sits an old, dusty photo. A photo whose color has begun to fade and edges have wrinkled from use. In the photo, a man with large green eyes stares up at the lady. The eyes of the beast.\n\nJust as quickly, her anger turns into despair. She falls to her knees and grabs the old photo, holding it to her breast. She weeps. She weeps for the days when he was here. Then, the house was brighter, the window curtains pushed aside to allow sunlight in. Now, the sunlight doesn’t even come into the house. The window is like some force field keeping the daylight out. \n\nThe woman wept for a long time. Finally, she was able to brush away enough tears to look back into the closet. An old newspaper article lie on the floor. She grabbed it and read for the thousandth-time “Car Crash on I-20 Kills Family, Only Wife Survives”. She closed her eyes for a second, taking in the weight of the heading about the poor family. Her family. \n\nShe began to get the shakes. On the floor was one last photo, lying face down. She knew what is in the photo, but couldn’t bare to look. Her trembles got worse, so she leaned against the wall for support. Unable to stop herself, she grabbed the photo from the floor, flipped it around, and stared into the eyes of her children. She fell over clutching the photo. With not more tears to shed, she just lay there wrapped in the arms of the beast. \n\nShe awakes the next morning with sunlight hitting her face. She puts the photos and newspaper clippings back into the closet, making sure to put her children facedown and everything back in the same order. She makes coffee, then goes out front for some fresh air. She feels hungover, but she knows it’s not from the beer. \n\nOutside, the Sun is shining, but she doesn’t see it. The wind is blowing, but she can’t feel it. The kids are playing across the street and she watches them. As she turns to walk back inside, she hears a noise from around the corner of the house. She walks around and sees a dog going through her trash. \n\nThe dog’s ribs are showing and it steps back in fright. The lady walks into the house to get a cold weiner from the fridge. She comes back out with the food and the dog nervously approaches her. The dog takes the food, eats it, and is transformed by the generosity. The dog wags its tail. \n\n“Oh, you like that? You look a bit broken, pooch. Do you mind if I call you that? I bet not. Pooch it is. Well, Pooch, I’m a bit broken too. I think everyone is a bit broken inside. How about we be broken together?

The strings came from brass cavities in the wall and the other ends attached to something unknown to the people. They were meant to pull the strings to taut and they all did this simultaneously at the chiming of the bell. The strings whirred out of each brass fixture activating some guessed at mechanics inside the walls, flywheels and gears and such, clicking and clunking like old clockwork. The strings were too long for the people to simply pull and stand in their rooms, pulled taut the length of these strings would leave the people standing in their hallways. Sometimes, the people would speak to each other.\n\nOliver was told about the unusual custom by Lester on the day he had moved into the old Abbey Apartment building on Flint Street; bell and line. “Who is it that rings the bell?” Oliver was new and knowing no one but directing his question to a sea of old faces in the hall, holding his handle and string.\n\n“It is not for us to know, just accept that it is so,” replied old Mrs. Cardicole. “We pull our strings each time it rings. That is the nature of living here, though it may seem vain and queer. Our labor is to taut the strings whenever the bell of Abbey rings.”\n\n“Where do the strings go?” Oliver asked, not wanting to give up so easily.\n\n“We pull our strings, the brass handled strings and meet here in the hall. That’s all to say. It’s the way of things. There’s nothing more at all!” and Mrs. Cardicole gave a stern face as if to say, *I disapprove of this line*.\n\nEveryone else looked on and felt for Oliver. The residents knew the custom was odd but it was truly simply the way of things in the old Abbey Apartments on Flint Street.\n\nThen the strings pulled back into their holes by automatic mechanism and everyone returned to whatever they had been doing. Some were watching television, others were reading, others were having dinner. Young Lester and Sable were tending to their newborn son. Life in the apartment building on Flint Street was quiet and most like usual, save for this one quirk of the handled strings and the chiming bell.\n\nSometimes, people would venture to look for the bell. Most obvious was that it would be on top of the building, but Lester once discovered that it was not. He told a very few people about his searching and occasionally, people would help Lester to look for it. Mrs. Cardicole would watch the people searching from her custom one-way porthole. She would take notes on who was looking and what they might be saying. “Always searching for the bell, these transgressions lead to Hell.” Her hair was red and frizzed and she seemed a kind of recluse. Some might say that Mrs. Cardicole was a shut-in, but she had her reasons, and her husband Frank in his urn would not judge her like her neighbors did.\n\nThe bell rang early the following day and all the neighbors grasped their handles and pulled their strings from the brass fixtures in their apartments. They met out in the hall again and Mrs. Cardicole spied Oliver instantly and judged his efforts as lackluster, slack was his string. He was not doing as well and he could, and his string was not as taut as hers. The neighbor Lester saw the judgement on Mrs. Cardicole’s face and it entertained the dark parts of his mind. The ringing bell had twisted his thoughts and every day, sometimes twice in one, he’d be a slave to it. Mrs. Cardicole’s judgement was something new, Oliver was something new, so Lester looked on in madness and a voice screamed in his mind. He thought of scissors and of string, screaming madness and slicing blades. Lester’s string was taut and the mechanisms to it locked in and he dropped his handle in the hall and went inside his apartment. Lester came back a moment later with a pair of scissors and picked up his handle again, in front of everyone, and cradled the string between the scissor blades. He looked again at Mrs. Cardicole’s silent judgement and relished in it, for now it was directed at him and not Oliver. Lester severed the handle from the string and almost immediately after, the strings pulled back into their holes and the people followed after, continuing their quiet lives in their apartments. Lester’s string vanished beyond the wall, somewhere behind his holed brass fixture.\n\nOliver spent the day considering Lester. How long has the process been driving him mad? Oliver would like to speak to Lester at some point so he decided he would, next time he had the chance. But it was evening when the bell chimed again and everyone pulled their strings out into the hall but there was no Lester. Oliver looked for him to come out at his door, but nobody came. Of course, why would they? There was no string for Lester or Sable to pull. The curious neighbors decided to investigate, at least to see what had become of Lester’s madness. One held another’s handled string while one investigated Lester’s door. It was ajar and pushed open easily but Lester was nowhere to be seen, nor was Sable or the newborn.\n\n“Claimed by sin and no line taut, this is what his cutting brought.” Mrs. Cardicole gave a wry smile. Everyone came back to their spots and held their strings, not daring to let go and dismissing all thoughts of stepping out of line, all thoughts of knives and scissors banished; all minds were bent on the taut strings. Even Oliver did not dare to ask Mrs. Cardicole any more questions.\n\nFor the second time in the day, the strings pulled back into their brass openings and the people retreated back into their apartments, neverminding the strange reality they had all accepted with reluctant grace. Mrs. Cardicole watched them all mindlessly slink through their doors through her porthole then waited a moment for good measure. She quietly left her apartment and descended the stairwell then went into the basement. She had a key, the only key that opened the boiler room and there she came to it again, the caged Ardalent, the demon toddler she kept in her charge, giant and harlequin. Mrs. Cardicole stepped over the bodies of Lester and Sable. The Ardalent had his own string that hung down into his cage, one that chimed the unseen bell, and the neighbors did as they always had upon hearing it. Their strings came to an engine of coiled metal that powered a music box set to Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata. It was his lullaby. Mrs. Cardicole fed the Ardalent what she could from the bodies of Lester and Sable. She blew a kiss to the demon toddler and left the boiler room, locking the door behind her. She ascended the stairs and went back, unseen, into her apartment to find the child of Lester and Sable, now hers to raise; a brother for her dear Ardalent.","title":"The Ardalent Strings"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize everything relating to Ardalent.","answers":[{"answer":"Ardalent is a demon toddler who lives in a cage in the basement of the apartment building on Flint Street.

He had a look of anticipation, as if he was waiting for some pain relieving gossip. \n\n“I was home,” I responded innocently before he rolled his eyes at me. “Now, don’t bother me, I’m trying to focus.” Although normally I would use anything to distract me from school, I wasn’t about to involve Max in last night’s mess.\n\n“Are you expecting me to believe you weren’t at Nina’s party?” He raised his eyebrows at me. I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me. Perhaps I couldn’t fix her parent’s divorce, but I could at least attend her house party. Especially after her break up with Todd, the leather jacket douche that called her “babe” so much I would wonder if he knew her real name.\n\n“I promise you’ll have a great time,” Nina had told me. And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle. Something nostalgic about repetitive rap songs preaching about the wonders of big asses. \n\nEverything seemed normal at first. The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room. I could feel the air thickening. \n\nMinutes before terror, I was standing unnoticed next to a group of girls I recognized. \n\n“Someone told me her dad was abusive,” I heard one say with wide eyes. \n\n“Yeah, apparently the neighbors called the cops on them,” another responded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t point fingers just yet. Nina’s mom’s a bitch. Maybe she deserved it,” a brunette shrugged and took a sip of her drink right before our eyes met. Her face flared red as she realized her words had been overhead. I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry. A millisecond later, I spotted Nina on the floor. Hands covering her face in defense. The lack of light in the room didn’t stop the fierceness of her blood as it dripped down her temple and into her hair. \n\nI stood still. My brain called in fear but my body made no response. Not even when Todd walked passed me, into the hallway and shut the door behind him. \n\nNina remained on the floor. She held herself and rocked back and forth, letting silent cries out into the thick air. \n\n“Don’t tell anyone.” She whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” Max snapped at me. “Are you going to tell me or not?” I stared at him blankly as the vivid flashbacks flew through my head.

A cheap-ass, sun-faded, rusted-over excuse of an amusement park stuck just outside a notorious ghetto right off the freeway.  \n\n\nNo shit. Zulu.  \n\n\nI kid you not; the motif was *jungle adventure*. Fiberglass lions and gorillas lurching about. Man-sized tribal masks announcing the park rules. Plastic trees and a couple of pock-marked rubber crocodiles floating in the unnatural electric blue water of a concrete pool. Are you ready for the mascot? Yes, you got it - a saucer-eyed, cartoon pygmy with a bone through its nose and hair like it just stuck it's dick in an electrical outlet. Cutouts of Zinger-Zu in front of every ride telling kids how tall they had to be....  \n\n\nSo egregious, it soared right over \"unacceptably offensive\" and landed square on \"ironically acceptable kitsch.\" And it was located in Dallas County, Texas, so that helped.  \n\n\nVirgil had been born into the ghetto that sprawled behind the zig-zag shadows of Zulu's dilapidated roller coasters. As a very young child, that park represented the promise of magic, adventure and mystery. Of course, money being money, he'd never been allowed to visit during those innocent years; and you grow up fast in the ghetto, so by the time Virgil actually did get to pass through the wrought iron gates for a sample of jungle paradise, he was already too old to believe in voodoo or hippopotamuses. No, as a pre-teen and teenager, he went to Zulu exclusively to buy weight and sell dime-bags to suburbanites from Fort Worth.  \n\n\nHe'd never had the chance or, later, the inclination to ride a single ride.  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \n\n\nOlder now, Virgil had lived 35 years, married twice, and had four kids. He stood six foot two inches, still trim at two hundred pounds. He had a good job in the city; a respectable house in the suburbs. His current girlfriend was able to trick him into church on Sunday mornings because she knew how to handle him on Saturday nights. If he wasn't careful, she'd become #3.  \n\n\nHe was driving down the freeway with his youngest son, Wayne, and the child made a curious noise when they passed the almost illegibly weathered sign for \"Zulu! Live the Adventure!\"  \n\n\n\"What?\" Virgil asked his boy.  \n\n\n\"Zulu...,\" the child said. \"Zoo?\"  \n\n\n\"Nah.\" Virgil laughed. \"But good guess. Hey, you know....\"  \n\n\nVirgil checked the mirrors and exited the freeway. \"You want to live the adventure, little man?\"  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \n\n\nWayne's mother was crazy. Not quite rising to the level of court mandated institutionalization, but Virgil figured that was only more bizarre road-rage incident away. Nevertheless, for all her batshit inclinations, she was very smart. Once she'd told Virgil that her IQ had been tested in the genius level. And he believed her. But, really, what did it matter if you could mentally convert ounces to grams or recite poetry from memory if you couldn't buy a dress without getting into a vicious fight with the saleslady, knocking over the window display, and getting chased out of the mall by a team of rent-a-cops?  \n\n\nVirgil was well rid of that situation; but he enjoyed spending time with their child. The boy seemed to have acquired his mother's intelligence, with none of the insanity. Virgil supposed it was bad form to pick favorites, but of all his children, Wayne was the only one he actively troubled himself to spend time with. All the others were dropped off by mandate; but Virgil would go out of his way to pick up Wayne and gladly hold on to him an extra couple of hours or even an entirely unscheduled day when the situation called for it.  \n\n\nWayne was Virgil's little man. He was a calm, thoughtful, observant and sharp child. His soft, brown eyes took in everything, then his brow would furrow or his smile would widen depending on the situation, and then he'd react in a delightfully mature and appropriate manner. It gave Virgil a sense of peace and rightness, walking hand in hand with his little man.  \n\n\nJust as they did passing through the gates of the Zulu amusement park together; Virgil having purchased two tickets to spend some time reliving his past and sharing the experience with his son.  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \n\n\n\"I used to come here pretty much every night when I was a teen,\" Virgil told Wayne. They were strolling down the market street, past the arcade, souvenir shops, and overpriced food stands. All the buildings were in need of paint and repair - the wood beam facades were chipped and rutted, sporting plenty of graffiti, and the roofs that were supposed to be thatched with palm-leafs had large bare sections of corrugated metal shining through. \"It hasn't changed much,\" Virgil said, sadly.  \n\n\nAs they continued through the park, Virgil would offer to take Wayne on some of the rides - Voom Voom Vulture! Zambizi Zinger! Python Plunge! - but the boy judiciously shook his head to the negative. It wasn't fear, just common sense. Everything looked so rickety and sketchy; even if the cabs didn't fall off their disintegrating rails, it certainly didn't look like much fun to be jerked around in those rusty metal buckets for three minutes of bad track.  \n\n\n\"How about go-karts?\" Virgil suggested. Wayne considered this for a moment and then smiled.  \n\n\n\"Okay,\" he agreed. \"Go-karts sound good.\"  \n ","title":"[RF] Lets try this again"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the plot of the story.","answers":[{"answer":"Virgil and his son, Wayne, visit Zulu, an amusement park where Virgil used to frequent as a teenager.

Wallscott was taught to weave flax in Taieri by her aunt Ripeka Martin (formerly Karetai).[5] For several years, she taught at small schools in Stewart Island, Bluff, Wyndham, Clifton, Invercargill and Dunedin.[6]\n\nFrom 1944-1948 Wallscott taught at the Ōtākou Native School, and during this time she began an active role at the Ōtākou Marae which continued for 30 years. Although Wallscott never married or had children, she raised a whāngai, her niece Iri Wallscott.[7] After retiring from teaching in 1953, Wallscott began a new career in community service that she maintained into her 90s.[8]\n\n\nMāori Women's Welfare League\n\nWallscott was a founding member of the Māori Women's Welfare League, and was the Ōtepoti Representative of the league for many years.[9][10] Other Ōtepoti branch members included Victoria Potiki, Taka Moss, Rumatiki Wright and Jean Robinson.[11] Wallscott made significant contributions to the league over many years.[12] She relished the achievements of the Ōtepoti branch – “We have made our voice heard ... we are listened to ... we have just simply been so sincere that people have taken notice of us.”[13] In 1968, Wallscott accepted the McEwen trophy on behalf of the Te Waipounamu branch of the Māori Women's Welfare League, awarded to the area showing the greatest yearly increase in membership.[14]\n\n\nOther community work\n\n-   Foundation member of the Āraiteuru Cultural Club and helped establish its marae in Dunedin\n-   Ōtākou Marae (secretary)\n-   Ōtākou Māori Committee\n-   Ōtākou Māori Executive\n-   Te Wai Pounamu District Council\n-   Māori Mission Committee\n-   Dunedin Branch of National Council of Women\n-   Old Peoples' Welfare Council\n-   Board of Directors of YWCA\n-   In 1960 she became the first Māori women in Dunedin to be a Justice of the Peace.[15]\n-   In the 1980s Wallscott helped lead opposition to the Aramoana aluminum smelter.[16]\n\n\nNotable achievements\n\n-   In 1976, Wallscott was awarded the Queens Service Medal in the Queen's Birthday honours list for services to the community.[17]\n-   Wallscott was chosen as one of five people to accompany _Te Maori_ exhibition to San Francisco and attend the opening ceremonies in 1984.[18]\n-   In 1990 Wallscott received an award from the Māori and South Pacific Arts Council for her contribution to weaving.[19]\n\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Wallscott contributed audio recordings of her local place names to _Ngā Ingoa o Aotearoa: An Oral Dictionary of Māori Placenames._[20] In 1999, she donated many of her personal papers and archives to the Hocken Manuscripts and Archives Collection.[21] These included letters from friends and family, papers relating to land issues, the Māori Women's Welfare League, appointment diaries, notebooks, music and songs.[22]\n\nWallscott passed away on 17 February 1999, two months after her 100th birthday[23] At the time of her death, Wallscott was the oldest surviving member on Ngāi Tahu's tribal roll.[24][25]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10]  Items {{!}} National Library of New Zealand {{!}} National Library of New Zealand|language=English|access-date=2020-04-05}}\n\n[11] \n\n[12]  NZHistory, New Zealand history online|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|access-date=2020-04-05}}\n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n","title":"Magda Wallscott"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the conditions into which Magda Wallscott was born and grew up.","answers":[{"answer":"She was born in 1898, and her father was a professional soldier from Saxony, Germany.

One day you're having dinner with your family, imagining everything is fine. The next, your phone is exploding with calls from reporters. \n\nThey read you snippets from a press release written by Democratic Party operatives. They demand to know how you could possibly have said something so awful and offensive, and ask something like, \"Do you have a statement on how immoral you are?\" It's a bewildering moment, especially when the quotes in question are more than a decade old.\n\nThere's really not that much you can do to respond. It's pointless to try to explain how the words were spoken in jest or taken out of context, or in any case, bear no resemblance to what you actually think or would want for the country. None of that matters. Nobody cares. You know the role you're required to play. You are a sinner that needs the forgiveness of Twitter.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON.\n\nSo you issue a statement of deep contrition. You apologize profusely for your transgressions. You promise to be a better person going forward with the guidance of your contrition consultants. You send money to whatever organization that claims to represent the people you supposedly offended. Then you sit back, and brace for a wave of stories about your apology, all of which simply provide a pretext for attacking you again.\n\nIn the end, you get fired, you lose your job. Nobody defends you. Your neighbors avert their gaze as you pull into the driveway. You are ruined. And yet, no matter how bad it gets, no matter how despised and humiliated you may be, there is one thing you can never do -- one thing that is absolutely not allowed. You can never acknowledge the comic absurdity of the whole thing. You can never laugh in the face of the mob.\n\nYou must always pretend that the people yelling at you are somehow your moral superiors. You have to assume what they say they are mad about is what they are actually mad about. You have to take them at face value. You must pretend this is a debate about virtue and not about power. Your critics are arguing from principle, and not from partisanship.\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.\n\nNo matter what they take from you in the end, you must continue to pretend that these things are true. You are bad, they are good. The system is on the level.\n\nBut what if we stopped pretending for a minute? What if we acknowledged what's actually going on?\n\nOne side is deadly serious. They believe that politics is war. They are not interested in abstractions or principles, rules or traditions. They seek power, and they intend to win it with whatever it takes. If that includes getting you fired or silencing you, or threatening your family at home, or throwing you in prison, okay. They know what their goal is. If you are in way, they will crush you.\n\nWhat's interesting is how reliably the other side pretends that none of this is happening. Republicans in Washington do a fairly credible imitation of an opposition party. They still give speeches. They tweet quite a bit. They make certain noises about how liberals are bad.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.\n\nBut on the deepest level, it's all a pose. In their minds, where it matters, Republican leaders are controlled by the left. They know exactly what they are allowed to say and believe. They know what the rules are. They may understand that those rules are written by the very people who seek their destruction, but they ruthlessly enforce them anyway.\n\nRepublicans in Washington police their own with a never-ending enthusiasm. Like trustees at a prison, they dutifully report back to the ward, hoping for perks. Nobody wants to be called names. Nobody wants to be Trump.\n\nHow many times have you seen it happen? Some conservative figure will say something stupid, or incomplete, or too far outside the bounds of received wisdom for the moral guardians of cable news? Twitter goes bonkers. The mob demands a response. Very often, the first people calling for the destruction of that person are Republican leaders. You saw it with the Covington Catholic High School kids. You see it all the time. \n\nKevin McCarthy spends half his day telling Republican members not to criticize progressive orthodoxy. Paul Ryan did the same before him. A couple of years ago, the entire Democratic Party decided to deny the biological reality of sex differences, an idea that is insane as it is dangerous. Republican leaders decided to not criticize them for it. They might get upset.\n\nThis is a system built on deceit and enforced silence. Hypocrisy is its hallmark. Yet in Washington, it's considered rude to ask questions about how exactly it works. Why are the people who considered Bill Clinton a hero lecturing me about sexism? How can the party that demands racial quotas denounce other people as racist? After a while, you begin to think that may be their criticisms aren't sincere. Maybe their moral puffery is a costume. Maybe the whole conversation is an absurd joke. Maybe we are falling for it.\n\n  Since the day we went on the air, they [the left] have been working hard to kill this show. We haven't said much about it in public; it seemed too self- referential. The point of this show has never been us. But now, it's obvious to everybody. There is no pretending that it is not happening. It is happening, and so, going forward, we'll be covering their efforts to make us be quiet. \n\nYou sometimes hear modern progressives described as \"New Puritans.\" That's a slur on colonial Americans. Whatever their flaws, the Puritans cared about the fate of the soul and the moral regeneration of their society. Those are not topics that interest progressives. They're too busy pushing late-term abortions and cross-dressing on fifth-graders.\n\nThese are the people who write our movies and our sitcoms. They are not shocked by naughty words. They just pretend to be when it's useful. It's been very useful lately.\n\nThe left's main goal, in case you haven't noticed, is controlling what you think. In order to do that, they have to control the information that you receive. Google and Facebook and Twitter are fully on board with that. They are happy to ban unapproved thoughts, and they don't apologize for it. Same with the other cable channels and virtually every major news outlet in this country.\n\nOne of the only places left in the United States where independent thoughts are allowed is right here at Fox News -- the opinion hours on this network. Just a few hours in a sea of television programming. It's not much, relatively speaking. For the left, it's unacceptable. It demands total conformity.\n\nSince the day we went on the air, they've been working hard to kill this show. We haven't said much about it in public; it seemed too self- referential. The point of this show has never been us. But now, it's obvious to everybody. There is no pretending that it is not happening. It is happening, and so, going forward, we'll be covering their efforts to make us be quiet. \n\nFor now, though, just two points to leave you with. First, Fox News is behind us, as they have been since the very first day. Toughness is a rare quality in a TV network, and we are grateful for that. Second, we've always apologized when we are wrong and we will continue to do that. That's what decent people do -- they apologize.\n\nBut we will never bow to the mob -- ever. No matter what.\n\n_Adapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on March 11, 2019._\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about Republicans?","answers":[{"answer":"The Fox News article says that most Republicans in Washington are not as conservative as they claim.

Not only were they, but in some cases these observers disturbed the count; others can be seen watching counters on livestreams.\n\nThe president’s words aren’t surprising, as he’d suggested ahead of the election that he would not accept its results. And, true to form, he has not.\n\nIn many ways, the official statement is a more formal version of the baseless allegations of voter fraud the president made in a series of tweets Saturday morning, in which he appeared to desperately grasp at any whimsical conspiracy theory necessary to keep power.\n\nIn those tweets, Trump lied about votes being “illegally received” in Pennsylvania “and certain other states.” Despite the fact, of course, that all states have counted only ballots submitted according to their guidelines. Some states, like Pennsylvania, allowed mail-in ballots received after Election Day — but with a postmark from Election Day, or earlier — to be counted. There’s nothing illegal about this, however; in fact, states are legally obligated to count ballots that are submitted in accordance with election law.\n\nTrump also lied on Twitter about election observers not being allowed in counting rooms in “numerous states.” As noted above, this is false.\n\nThe tweets were flagged by Twitter as “disputed” and potentially “misleading.”\n\n  ....This would ALSO change the Election result in numerous States, including Pennsylvania, which everyone thought was easily won on Election Night, only to see a massive lead disappear, without anyone being allowed to OBSERVE, for long intervals of time, what the happened...\n\n  — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2020\n\n  ....Bad things took place during those hours where LEGAL TRANSPARENCY was viciously & crudely not allowed. Tractors blocked doors & windows were covered with thick cardboard so that observers could not see into the count rooms. BAD THINGS HAPPENED INSIDE. BIG CHANGES TOOK PLACE!\n\n  — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2020\n\nOverall, there is no evidence of voter fraud or tampering with vote counting. As Vox’s Aaron Rupar explained, the Trump campaign is making wild allegations of impropriety now and hoping to find evidence for them later:\n\n  Their strategy is to make allegations first and HOPEFULLY FIND EVIDENCE FOR THEM LATER. This state of affairs was thrown into stark relief late Friday morning during a Fox News interview with RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel. During it, Fox News hosts appeared to be out of patience with her evidence-free insinuations that the election was somehow stolen from Trump.\n\n  “We just haven’t seen it. It hasn’t been presented. There’s all kinds of stuff flying on the internet, but when we look into it, it doesn’t pan out,” anchor Bret Baier told McDaniel, as she failed to explain how her technical gripes about election observers in Michigan could possibly affect the result in a state Biden appears poised to win by well over 100,000 votes.\n\nTrump took these falsehoods to a new level Saturday, concluding his morning tweets with a incorrect statement that he actually won the election, writing “I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!”\n\n  I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!\n\n  — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2020\n\nIt’s concerning that the president of the United States is just outright lying about an election he lost, and that he has refused to concede now that it is clear he has lost. Perhaps even worse is that several high level Republican lawmakers have joined in on spreading doubt about the accuracy of the election results. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), along with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, all appeared on Fox News to repeat the false assertion that Trump won the election.\n\nWhat lawsuits come Monday remain to be seen. But it is clear that Trump expects the courts to save him. However, as Vox’s Ian Millhiser has explained, that’s not a strategy that is likely to bear fruit. And whether he concedes or not, Biden will be sworn in as the next president of the United States in January.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWILL YOU HELP KEEP VOX FREE FOR ALL?\n\nThere is tremendous power in understanding.

He had a look of anticipation, as if he was waiting for some pain relieving gossip. \n\n“I was home,” I responded innocently before he rolled his eyes at me. “Now, don’t bother me, I’m trying to focus.” Although normally I would use anything to distract me from school, I wasn’t about to involve Max in last night’s mess.\n\n“Are you expecting me to believe you weren’t at Nina’s party?” He raised his eyebrows at me. I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me. Perhaps I couldn’t fix her parent’s divorce, but I could at least attend her house party. Especially after her break up with Todd, the leather jacket douche that called her “babe” so much I would wonder if he knew her real name.\n\n“I promise you’ll have a great time,” Nina had told me. And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle. Something nostalgic about repetitive rap songs preaching about the wonders of big asses. \n\nEverything seemed normal at first. The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room. I could feel the air thickening. \n\nMinutes before terror, I was standing unnoticed next to a group of girls I recognized. \n\n“Someone told me her dad was abusive,” I heard one say with wide eyes. \n\n“Yeah, apparently the neighbors called the cops on them,” another responded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t point fingers just yet. Nina’s mom’s a bitch. Maybe she deserved it,” a brunette shrugged and took a sip of her drink right before our eyes met. Her face flared red as she realized her words had been overhead. I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry. A millisecond later, I spotted Nina on the floor. Hands covering her face in defense. The lack of light in the room didn’t stop the fierceness of her blood as it dripped down her temple and into her hair. \n\nI stood still. My brain called in fear but my body made no response. Not even when Todd walked passed me, into the hallway and shut the door behind him. \n\nNina remained on the floor. She held herself and rocked back and forth, letting silent cries out into the thick air. \n\n“Don’t tell anyone.” She whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” Max snapped at me. “Are you going to tell me or not?” I stared at him blankly as the vivid flashbacks flew through my head. My heart stung in bitterness as I recognized that all I wanted to do was say it. To write it out in sharpie on all student lockers.\n\nNina’s bloody face burned in my head. “There’s nothing to tell.”","title":"[RF] Last Night Leftovers"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the passage say about Todd?","answers":[{"answer":"Todd is Nina's ex-boyfriend.

However, the results of his autopsy released months later indicated a far more sinister cause of death and the heavily redacted FBI documents that were just released add to that story.\n\nThe documents, detailing the FBI investigation into Lesin’s death were just released Saturday morning in spite of the investigation ending in October of 2016.\n\nIn spite of the original cause of death noted as a heart attack, a few months later, the District of Colombia’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) and Metropolitan Police Department said that “blunt force injuries of the neck, torso, upper extremities and lower extremities” contributed to Lesin’s death. “The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) has released the cause and manner of death for Mikhail Lesin… Cause of Death: blunt force injuries of the head,” the statement said.\n\nNow, FBI investigators have released the results of their investigation claiming that the blunt force trauma all over his body was self-inflicted.\n\n“Mr. Lesin died as a result of blunt for injuries to his head, with contributing causes being blunt force injuries of the neck, torso, upper extremities, and lower extremities, which were induced by falls, with acute ethanol intoxication,” the report states.\n\nIn other words, the FBI is claiming that Lesin got so drunk that he repeatedly and violently fell on things until he killed himself.\n\nTo show just how much information the FBI is willing to release on these findings, here is the version of the amended autopsy report they released in the report.\n\n[RT]\n\n[rt]\n\nEssentially, all other information in regards to the findings of Lesin’s death has been scrubbed from the documents as the remaining pages are almost entirely redacted.\n\nNot only did the US remain tight-lipped on the investigation but they also refused to allow Russian authorities to cooperate.\n\nAs RT reports, back in 2016, months before the closing of the case, Moscow said it was expecting Washington to explain why Russia had not received any details from the probe into Lesin’s death, despite repeated requests.\n\n_“We are awaiting the related clarifications from Washington and the official data on the progress of the investigation,”_ Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote in a Facebook post at that time. She added that if the media reports citing the forensic statement are confirmed, Russia will send an official request to the US_ “for international legal assistance.”_\n\nIn October 2016, the US authorities announced that Lesin died of natural causes and closed the case. _“Based on the evidence, including video footage and witness interviews, Mr. Lesin entered his hotel room on the morning of Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2015, after days of excessive consumption of alcohol and sustained the injuries that resulted in his death while alone in his hotel room,”_ the US attorney for the District of Columbia said in a statement.\n\nLesin’s death came at a time where he was surrounded by controversy, especially in the US. RT, the Russian-based news source that Lesin founded has become very controversial in the US—ostensibly for the fake Russiagate scandal—but in reality, for challenging the western narrative of foreign policy and privacy issues. Some US politicians have suggested that RT be banned in the US for “spreading propaganda,” while others have been blatant enough to attack Lesin personally.\n\nAccording to the NY Times, until late 2014 Lesin ran the media wing of the state’s energy giant, Gazprom, before stepping down or, more likely, being forced out. He ended up in the United States, where he and his family owned properties in Los Angeles said to be worth far more than the salary of the former government minister.\n\nSome US Senators, including Roger Wicker of Mississippi, had called for the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Lesin’s finances prior to his death.\n\nWicker was concerned that Lesin made too much money, something that was really none of his business.\n\n“That a Russian public servant could have amassed the considerable funds required to acquire and maintain these assets in Europe and the United States raises serious questions,” Wicker said.\n\nThe original announcement of the heart attack back in November 2015 makes this case all the more ominous considering the fact that the medical examiner’s office also said Lesin’s body had blunt force trauma to the neck, torso, arms and legs too. How did authorities overlook his wounds?\n\nAs RT reports, Lesin was considered one of the most influential figures in the Russian media landscape. A graduate of Moscow State University with a degree in Civil Engineering, he served as Minister of Press and Mass Media from 1999 to 2004. He was also a presidential media adviser from 2004 to 2009. Lesin became chief executive officer at Garprom-Media in 2013 and remained in the position until early 2015.\n\nSponsored Content:\n\n[]\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Why is it hard for critics to accept that Mikhail Lesin killed himself?","answers":[{"answer":"It was not obvious at first that his injuries were self-inflicted.","critiques":[{"critique":"The passage does not say why critics find it hard to accept that Lesin killed himself.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"\"It was not obvious at first that his injuries were self-inflicted.\" is a synopsis of what happened happened after Lesin's death, not why it took critics to accept the official verdict.

I started writing but now I don't know what direction to take it in! Any ideas would be great!\n\nThe men gathered around the table were yelling at each other. They all dressed in the finest suits and each had an air of self-entitlement. The room was barren except for a large oak wood table the stood elegantly in the center. Chairs circled the table and a few had been knocked over when the men had stood up to yell. The room was well lit with a large window that nearly took up an entire wall. The large window provided the room with natural light so there were no lights in the room. There were three doors in the room, two of them led to a different tower of the hotel. The third was a large decorative door with intricate gold plated designs carved in the door. This conference room was on the last floor of the hotel before the hotel split into two different towers. The hotel itself was a large hotel in Chicago, one of the best. Known for its extreme luxury and quality service, many major corporations and business meetings of the extremely wealthy were held here because of its top-notch service. The room was painted a light yellow with a mirror that hung over a fireplace. There were old paintings from the 1600’s that covered the walls and gave the room an elegant museum-like feel. \n\tThe men were in the middle of yelling when the large door swung open and the room went quite. The men who weren’t already standing quickly stood up a man walked slowly towards the head of the table. The man stood at the head of the table, looking around the room at who was presented before him. \n“Take a seat.” The man said and the men in front of him quickly sat down again. “I would like to introduce myself. My name is Anthony Kane.” \n\tThe alarm went off on the clock and the rooms lights dimmed on. Stephen sat up and turned off his alarm clock. He sat upright on his bed for a minute with his hair disheveled before he swung his legs out from under the comforters and put his feet in his slippers. His apartment was in downtown Chicago on the top floor penthouse. His blinds opened automatically every morning to wake him up. His room was very spacious and modernly designed with grey walls and white carpet. On the wall opposite his bed there was a walk in closet that he used to keep his expensive suits. As he stood up and walked out of the room, he picked up the robe that was lying on the armchair by the door. He walked down the corridor into the kitchen. He cooked and left food for his wife and kids to have when they woke up.\nStephen’s phone rang as he took the elevator down. He didn’t recognize the number and when he picked up, he didn’t recognize the voice. The caller told him to go to a very important meeting that was taking place at one of the nicest hotels in the area. The caller assured him that it was just a regular business meeting. The caller then told Stephen a serious of numbers that he scribbled on a post it. He was confused on what the meeting was about and when he asked any of his coworkers at the firm he worked at what the meeting was, none of them knew. \n\tStephen showed at the hotel at exactly 2 pm just like that caller had said. He went to the front desk and told the receptionist the series of numbers.\n“Follow me,” the receptionist walked around the counter and went to the elevator. They took the elevator up to the 5th floor. “This is as far as I can go. Go down the hall, take a right and go into the room at the end.” The receptionist closed the elevator door and left him alone in the corridor. \n\tIn the room, people were already seated around the large table and were quiet. As he picked the only empty seat in the room, he realized he didn’t recognize a single person in the room. The people in the room were all men with really expensive, luxurious suits. Everyone in the room looked extremely wealthy. They sat quietly and after a few minutes of silence people started to talk and soon people were arguing about baseball. They argued and stood up and yelled at each other. The yelling ceased when the large doors swung open. A man walked in slowly and stood at the head of the table. He looked around the room at all the faces and people. The man wore a black suit with a gold tie. He had numerous large, extravagant rings on his fingers. \n“I would like to introduce myself.

He had a look of anticipation, as if he was waiting for some pain relieving gossip. \n\n“I was home,” I responded innocently before he rolled his eyes at me. “Now, don’t bother me, I’m trying to focus.” Although normally I would use anything to distract me from school, I wasn’t about to involve Max in last night’s mess.\n\n“Are you expecting me to believe you weren’t at Nina’s party?” He raised his eyebrows at me. I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me. Perhaps I couldn’t fix her parent’s divorce, but I could at least attend her house party. Especially after her break up with Todd, the leather jacket douche that called her “babe” so much I would wonder if he knew her real name.\n\n“I promise you’ll have a great time,” Nina had told me. And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle. Something nostalgic about repetitive rap songs preaching about the wonders of big asses. \n\nEverything seemed normal at first. The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room. I could feel the air thickening. \n\nMinutes before terror, I was standing unnoticed next to a group of girls I recognized. \n\n“Someone told me her dad was abusive,” I heard one say with wide eyes. \n\n“Yeah, apparently the neighbors called the cops on them,” another responded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t point fingers just yet. Nina’s mom’s a bitch. Maybe she deserved it,” a brunette shrugged and took a sip of her drink right before our eyes met. Her face flared red as she realized her words had been overhead. I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry. A millisecond later, I spotted Nina on the floor. Hands covering her face in defense. The lack of light in the room didn’t stop the fierceness of her blood as it dripped down her temple and into her hair. \n\nI stood still. My brain called in fear but my body made no response. Not even when Todd walked passed me, into the hallway and shut the door behind him. \n\nNina remained on the floor. She held herself and rocked back and forth, letting silent cries out into the thick air. \n\n“Don’t tell anyone.” She whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” Max snapped at me. “Are you going to tell me or not?” I stared at him blankly as the vivid flashbacks flew through my head. My heart stung in bitterness as I recognized that all I wanted to do was say it. To write it out in sharpie on all student lockers.\n\nNina’s bloody face burned in my head. “There’s nothing to tell.”","title":"[RF] Last Night Leftovers"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the passage say about Todd?","answers":[{"answer":"Todd is Nina's ex-boyfriend.

I strongly believe in the Golden Rule. I treat others as I would like to be treated: Holding doors open for those that I sense would have trouble. Giving up my seat to those that look as though they might need it: men, women, and the elderly. Being considerate! Saying thank you, and you're welcome! Thinking of others before myself. Writing \"thank you\" letters when appropriate. Not being mean to animals (perhaps excluding snakes and spiders unless they keep to themselves). I had always helped, and it felt good. But slowly, I began to notice things were changing. I still wanted to help others, but it was getting more difficult as I was passing the 3/4 of a century mark. I would tell my friends (just kidding) that I couldn't associate with people that old. When did I get this old? I have children over 50 and grandchildren over 20. Has society changed? Are its members less caring? I have heard this.\n\nI went to a take-out pizza establishment last week. Going in, I held open the door for a young lady who said \"thank you\", and when I entered, she insisted that I order before she did. The place was busy with little space to stand. When I picked up my order, I had to squeeze my way to the door as there was not much room, and I was having some trouble walking. As I got to the door, it opened. Automatic I thought. I looked down to find a boy of about ten holding it for me and smiling. \"Did I look that feeble?\" I thought. I said thank you, and he was smiling as he said \"your welcome.\" No one had told him to do it. He was on his own. I think it made him feel good! Someone had taught him manners. It feels good to help others.\n\nAnother pizza place I go to has a flight of stairs to overcome. Going up is not a problem, but going down with a pizza in hand is. One of the young employees asked if she could help. I said \"sure\". I went ahead, got in the car, and she handed it through the car window to me, all-the-while sporting a wide grin. Thanks, I said. You are welcome, she replied. Every time I get pizza and she is working, she immediately says \"I'll give it to you through the window.\" I think it makes her feel as good as it does me!\n\nWhen I go to the grocery store, I buy 2-3 weeks of food because I don't know when I will have the energy again(pain when walking, but getting better). The box boys or girls will always ask if they can empty the shopping cart for me. Then they bag the groceries and ask if they can help me load them into the car. I always ask them if they can go home with me and unload them and put them away too. They smile, we joke. I ask them if they are still in school and where they are attending. They are always friendly. I say thank you and they say \"you're welcome\".\n\nWhen did I get old? I stopped playing competitive softball at 70 due to some injuries, but I received a call from one of my softball friends saying that he is forming an 80-year old competitive team and would like me to play on the team. It was nice of him to ask, and I do think he meant it. As soon as I get rid of my pain, I will start slowly working out again. My mind says yes, but my body isn't so sure. I am \"bird-walking\"----getting off the subject now, so must get back on point.\n\nI had an appointment with a pain clinic. I knew the area well but had never seen the medical office. I had the address, but could not find any numbers on the buildings. My car does not have GPS(2002 model), and I was ten minutes late for the meeting. I had to park across the street in a dirt parking lot. The street had moderate traffic, but I managed to get across. The curb must have been at least 18-24 inches high. It seemed like an insurmountable wall, but by holding on to the front of a parked car, I managed to get up. Now there were four steps to climb and a heavy door to open. At the top of the stairs was a man of about 35 years old. He had tattoos on his arms and neck, and smiled at me and politely opened the door. I said thanks. I was told that other patients would have to be seen before me, and the wait might be an hour or more. I decided not to wait. I would go to the car, call my private doctor, tell him my pain situation and see if he would give me a shot for the it.\n\nAs I left the pain center, the tattooed man stood at the base of the steps. He smiled again and asked me if I needed any help. Was he waiting for me to leave so he might mug me? I wobbled down the 4 steps and said no thank you, my car is just across the street. He said, \"You don't look as though you can go that far\". \"If you give me your keys, I will go over and get it for you.\" I thought, \"Sure, then you will drive the car away.\" My car was a 15-year old Hyundai SUV. I didn't trust him even though he had opened a door for me and smiled at the same time. Surely, he had devious intentions. \"This doesn't look good,\" I thought. So, I said, \"I can make it.\" He backed off but watched as I tried to negotiate the 18 in curb. There was no car for me to grab for balance. He began to approach me again, and I began to sweat. There was no one else nearby. He put one arm around my waist and proceeded to lift me off the ground. Then, oh so gently, moved me off the curb and onto the street 18 inches below. \"I hope this helps,\" he said with a smile. \"I'll watch as you cross the street\", he said still smiling. I felt bad that I had jumped to conclusions and again said \"thanks\".\n\nI called my doctor whose office was 10 minutes away. His nurse told me that the doctor said to come in, and he wanted to know if she could give me the shot. I said that would be fine, but I will have a lot of trouble getting out of the car much less getting around to the office as the parking was in the back. He worked from the house that he had turned into his office. He was the only doctor that worked there. I had known him and his nurse for 25 years. She was cute and always in a good mood. She came to the back, needle in hand, had me open the driver's side door, had me pull one side of my pants down an inch exposing my left hip, and with great joy jammed the needle in it.\n\n\"This doesn't look good!,\" I said smiling. \"People might get the wrong idea!\" She laughed, I smiled. This didn't look good, but neither did the fellow with the tattoo. This was all about people that I had met recently and the good that they had done, and how it feels to help others.","title":"[MF] THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD..."},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about strangers?","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator is a kind person who helps others.

Water is inanimate. It can neither dwell nor sit. What does water do? Rest? Lie? \n\nPerch?\n\n-'Perch'? Are we out of our linguistic mind? Water is not a cat! All those earlier description failures are attempts at personifying a thing. I suppose water CAN course (but only when there is an active current and gravity to push the molecules). In most ordinary instances that we can think of, it appears that water can only 'be' (as far as within the flat, level environment of a deep, lonely well.)\n\nOk then. let's try again. \"Down in the well, the water just was.\"\n\n-Humm. We can't think of a good rhyme for 'was'. We were going to try 'cause' in the next line but that's a real stretch to rhyme 'was' and 'cause'. Maybe we should actually try to personify the water. That might be interesting.\n\n\"Down in the well the water lurked. It was such a ridiculous construct it made us smirk.\"\n\n-Yeah, 'lurked' and 'smirk' are too silly to use in serious writing and we're still uncomfortable with the idea of personifying a thing. \n\n'Bubbled'? 'Gurgled'? 'Rested'? 'Was corralled'? 'Contained within'? That last one is technically accurate but it's too awkward to 'flow' smoothly into a verse. \n\n-Hummm, flow? Nah. 'Flow' also implies gravitational action that wouldn't be at work inside a well. \n\n'Floated'?  \n\n-Well, that's somewhat accurate but really other things float IN water. They work against the collection of hydrogen and oxygen molecules to be buoyant. \n\nCan't something float within itself? \n\n-Nah, too metaphysical. We must keep the poem easy to comprehend. \n\nPoem? Who says this is a POEM? Does it have to be? Dude! Maybe it's a gruesome horror story and there's a dead body floating IN the tepid water! \n\n   \"Down in the well, the water contained the bloated body of Randolph Ringhoffer.\"\n\nDoes the name 'Ringhoffer' or having double 'R' initials distract from the story idea? Should we have used a more common name like 'Jones'? \n\n-What does it matter at this point, 'dude'? How can anything distract a reader if we only have one sentence so far? It's silly to worry about such things this early.\n\n   That's not true at all. I happen to already know that Mr. Ringhoffer was intentionally pushed into the well by an angry malcontent. He drowned. He's been floating there five weeks in the stagnant, festering pool. His restless spirit has been getting angrier by the minute until someone extracts revenge on... Butch Cas... er... Carson. The local outlaw, Butch Carson.\n\n-'Outlaw'? Open well? 'Malcontent'? 'Butch'? Is this a 'Wild West' roundup tale or something? Those aren't common terms and situations for modern times. \n\n   As a matter of fact it is, Mr. Negative. It takes place in 1887, in frontier Wyoming. That's where Mr. Ringhoffer's cattle ranch is. What's with all the single quotes, anyway? Is that a manifestation of your contempt for my writing choices? \n\n-Take it easy, 'hoss'. I'm just echoing the subconscious thoughts of your potential readers. That's the sort of thing that would occur to them. You know I'm your inner monologue. It's my job to critique and challenge you creatively. Otherwise you do not grow as a writer and storyteller.\n\nIf you are just a part of my creativity, how do you know what others will think about my details? What innate insight do you have? You're just an annoying voice in my head.\n \n -As a matter of fact, myself and the inner monologues of everyone else in the world gets together for big discussions and conferences. We evaluate things. We discuss YOU and your penchant to over-analyze small details. It's sad really. We feel you could achieve some great things if you'd just let the writing occur naturally. Stop agonizing over minute details.\n\nOk. Fair enough. I understand 'you' are just trying to help. Could we have a little more 'constructive' and a little less outright 'criticism'?\n\n-Yes. Sure. I don't want you to feel discouraged either. It's a balancing act. I'm digging the story idea so far. I'm anxious to see where you go with it. Just please, for all that is holy, do NOT weave a well-worn cliché about rival wealthy landowners who dam up the river to extract gold from the stream. That would just be 'Unforgiven'.

That is going to happen. Elections have consequences.”\n\n  \"To be clear, what you described is a quid pro quo\" -- Here's Mick Mulvaney casually admitting that Trump held up aid to Ukraine as leverage to get the Ukrainian government to investigate the 2016 election pic.twitter.com/ylz7BKEmKd\n\n  — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 17, 2019\n\nForeign policy negotiations often demand trading a move by one country with a policy change by the other. President John F. Kennedy resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis with the Soviet Union by agreeing to remove U.S. nuclear missiles from Turkey in exchange for the USSR pulling its nuclear missiles from Cuba.\n\nWhat makes Trump’s exchange different is that the “favor” he asked of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a personal, political benefit. The insertion of personal gain is what makes it corrupt.\n\nMulvaney claimed that the Trump administration was withholding aid from Ukraine to coerce the country into investigating a supposed Democratic National Committee email server and alleged “corruption” in the 2016 election ― not former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump’s top political rivals heading into 2020. (Mulvaney’s claim is incomplete and misleading: Trump brought up both the DNC server and Biden in his call with Ukraine’s president.)\n\nWhen Karl asked why the U.S. stopped the aid, Mulvaney said that Trump thought it was unfair that the European Union wasn’t doing more to help Ukraine.\n\nThen Mulvaney referenced a debunked conspiracy theory that claims the DNC’s physical “server” is missing in a cover-up and that Crowdstrike, a private cybersecurity company hired to investigate Russia’s hack of the DNC’s servers, is framing Russia for election interference.\n\n“Did [Trump] also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that,” Mulvaney told the reporter. “But that’s it, and that’s why we hung up the money.”\n\nAs The Daily Beast reported last year, the DNC’s so-called “server” is actually a system of 140 servers and none of the DNC’s machines are missing.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska denounced efforts to “hold up” foreign aid for political reasons.\n\n“You don’t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative,” Murkowski said in response to questions about Mulvaney’s press conference.\n\n  “You don’t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative,” Murkowski says when asked about Mulvaney comments today\n\n  She also says it’s not appropriate to hold G7 at Trump Doral\n\n  — Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) October 17, 2019\n\nHours after the news conference, Mulvaney walked back his admission that the U.S. withheld Ukranian aid for political gain.\n\nIn a lengthy statement, he said the opposite of his earlier remarks: “There was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukranian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.”\n\nMulvaney also wrongly blamed the media for “misconstruing” and putting a spin on the comments he made during the news conference, which was televised and streamed live to the public. \n\n_Paul Blumenthal contributed reporting._\n\n_This article has been updated with Mulvaney’s later comments denying he had said there was a quid pro quo over political help._\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n-   Mick Mulvaney Walks Back Admission Of Quid Pro Quo In Trump's Ukraine Call\n-   GOP Senator Breaks With White House Over Ukraine Quid Pro Quo\n-   John Bolton Instructed Aide To Warn White House Lawyers About Rudy Giuliani: Reports\n-   White House Adviser Considered EU Ambassador A National Security Risk: Report\n\nCalling all HuffPost superfans!\n\nSign up for membership to become a founding member and help shape HuffPost's next chapter\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about Mulvaney's statements regarding the foreign aid to Ukraine?","answers":[{"answer":"Mulvaney admitted that Trump withheld foreign aid in order to get Ukraine's help in the U.S. election.

His research primarily focused on the history of Sylhet. Due to his achievements, he was awarded the Bangla Academy Literary Award in 2004.[1] His research discovered unknown information about folk literature, and he wrote 19 books relating to it.[2]\n\n\nEarly life\n\nAli was born into a Bengali Muslim family in the village of Ludorpur in Jagannathpur, Sunamganj Subdivision in 1929. He was the third child of a family of five sons and one daughter. His mother, Mastura Khatun, was a teacher at the Ludorpur Ayaan Munshi Primary School. His father's name was Moulvi Muhammad Uthman Ullah.[3][4]\n\nHe studied in a _pathshala_ in the nearby village of Syedpur where he passed second place in the primary exam. He then studied in Government Jubilee High School where he completed his matriculation exams, before completing his I.A. and I.B. in Murari Chand College. Following this, he went to Dhaka University where he did a Master of Arts in Bengali language and Bengali literature. In the Govt.

Studying the Mymensingh Gitika, he was able to find evidence that nine of them were actually of Sylheti origin.[7] Ali corrected Ahmed Sharif, who wrote in his PhD thesis that medieval writer Shaykh Chand was from Chittagong, that the latter was actually from the Sylhet region. Ali was also of the opinion that Syed Sultan was a Sylheti.[8] He established a large personal library, which has benefited many future researchers.

Groping, harassment, exclusion etc. including scenes which boldly highlight ways in which women themselves contribute to their own marginalization.\n\nThis lightheartedness soon gives way to a section of vivid monologues portraying harmful ways in which women are victimized and oppressed, including molestation, child brides and gender based violence and abuse. This painful section is punctuated by a shrill call to action chant in Yoruba which ushers in an exhilarating and refreshing second half of the play with powerful portraits of resistance, triumph and celebration.

This prompted an obvious question: Would Republicans put their money where their mouth is and actually use their power to punish Trump?\n\nWell, House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked that question at Tuesday presser — and he made it clear the answer was no, at least as far as the GOP leadership was concerned.\n\nHere’s the key exchange between Ryan and a reporter:\n\n  RYAN: I understand the desire and the need to have good relations. That’s perfectly reasonable. But Russia is a menacing government that does not share our interests and does not share our values. And I think that should be made very, very clear.\n\n  REPORTER: What could you do? You guys are a co-equal branch of government. What could you do to make sure he [Trump] doesn’t do something ...\n\n  RYAN: Here’s what we can do, and here’s what we have already done — which is to put sanctions on Russia. ... We’d already put in place sanctions. If the [House] Foreign Affairs Committee or the Financial Service Committee — or the Senate Banking Committee — think that there are other sanctions that we have not yet put in place on Russia, I’m more than happy to consider those.\n\nNote how weaselly Ryan’s answer is. The question wasn’t, “What are you doing to punish Russia?” It was, “How can you constrain Trump from cozying up even more to Putin?” That isn’t a problem that can be solved by new sanctions. It would require passing legislation that puts limits on the president’s power to change US policy on a whole host of foreign policy issues (like Ukraine or Syria), or block Trump from firing special counsel Robert Mueller and ending the Russia collusion probe.\n\nBut doing something like that would, of course, provoke a major fight with Trump. Ryan is so unwilling to do that he won’t even think about proposing such measures. Instead, he moves to the safer ground of hypothetical new Russia sanctions that may never actually emerge and that wouldn’t really constrain Trump from changing US policy on Russia.\n\nThis speaks to a vital point about the GOP’s “backlash” against the Putin meeting. Ultimately, congressional Republicans mostly care more about staying in Trump’s good graces — and avoiding a fight that could jeopardize their legislative agenda and anger the pro-Trump base before the upcoming midterm elections — than about the ways that Trump is taking a hammer to decades of US foreign policy on Russia and other issues.\n\nRepublicans in Congress simply place a higher value on party unity than on the foreign policy principles they claim to stand for. If they didn’t, Ryan would actually be talking about new laws to constrain Trump.\n\nThat isn’t a value judgment, or even necessarily a criticism. There’s a case, from the Republican point of view, for refusing to cross Trump even when he tramples on years of conservative orthodoxy.\n\nBut Ryan isn’t making that case. He, and the rest of the mainstream GOP, is trying desperately to pretend that you can be anti-Putin and pro-Trump. But Monday’s presser made it clear that’s impossible.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWILL YOU HELP KEEP VOX FREE FOR ALL?\n\nThere is tremendous power in understanding.

This edict may be surprising to hear, especially as emphatically as Blevins said it when we spoke at a recent Samsung event.\n\nThough Blevins isn’t shy about being married, and his more than 10 million subscribers include people of every gender identity, the internet’s love of gossip has convinced the Twitch star not to invite women to participate in his __ _Fortnite Battle Royale_ livestreams. With fame comes scrutiny of every thing you say or do, he suggested, and that can sometimes lead to questions about who you’re sleeping or flirting with on the sly.\n\n“If I have one conversation with one female streamer where we’re playing with one another, and even if there’s a hint of flirting, that is going to be taken and going to be put on every single video and be clickbait forever,” Blevins told Polygon.\n\nThere’s some truth to the idea that flirting can lead to YouTube clickbait and invasive questions — Blevins has asked some himself when playing with other well-known (male) streamers. Take the clip below, from a Twitch stream with _Fortnite_ star Ali “Myth” Kabbani.\n\nImane “Pokimane” Anys is another big name on Twitch whose popularity grew rapidly over the last year, and when she started playing _Fortnite_ on streams with Kabbani, viewers began to ask: Are they dating? Fans assume Twitch streamers are in a relationship just as often as they speculate on their marital status. And that apparently includes Blevins, who used his mega-platform to further perpetuate that rumor.\n\nWhether or not it’s true that Anys and Kabbani are together is, obviously, their business. But when it comes to his relationship with streamer Jessica “Jghosty” Blevins, who often appears on her husband’s channel, Blevins is happy to open up about his devotion.\n\n“[Not being connected to other women online,] that was something I made 100-percent sure,” he said. It was his decision alone to keep his streaming partners men-only. “That was not even her. She had nothing to do with it. That was me being, ‘I love our relationship,’ and, ‘No — I’m not even gonna put you through that.’”\n\nA growing Twitch means a diminishing sense of privacy, especially for women on the platform. Female streamers have opened up before about the difficulty in maintaining a separation between their Twitch personas and who they are offline — often at the behest of viewers who demand answers, lest they assume what’s going on for themselves.\n\nRespect is a major part of playing _Fortnite_ and other games. Yet women often are the receiving end of anything but: “Twitch thots,” harassment, warding off obsessive or judgmental viewers are all serious concerns for well-known female streamers. In contrast to the reality of being a woman on Twitch, Blevins’ choice to draw a line feels like a conservative gesture — even a familiar, divisive one.\n\n“There hasn’t been a single female gamer or streamer on Twitch or anything like that who’s been upset about that,” he said of possible pushback. “I honestly think that [...] it’s just kinda like a respect thing.”\n\nNinja may not hear criticism of his decision, but similar gender-based views have received pushback in the political sphere — think of the outcry surrounding Vice President Mike Pence’s supposed marital boundaries. Still, the Twitch streamer is sticking to his absolute, which he believes is the only choice.\n\n“The only way to avoid that [gossip] is to not play with them at all.”\n\nUPDATE: Ninja has since responded to — and stood by — his comments to us on Twitter.

Though challenged in recent times by rival “discounters” such as Lidl (also German-owned), Aldi achieved sales in 2009 of more than 50 billion euros worldwide.\n\nLittle is known of the private lives of the Albrecht family, but Theo’s wealth was estimated by Forbes last year at $16.7 billion, making him the 31st richest person in the world and Germany’s second richest behind Karl at $23.5 billion; the brothers fortunes combined were exceed only by those of Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and the Mexican Carlos Slim.\n\nThe Albrechts’ obsession with privacy — living behind fortress-like security on estates overlooking the Ruhr valley, rarely snapped by paparazzi, never making public statements — derived in part from Theo’s experience in December 1971, when he was kidnapped at gunpoint by Heinz-Joachim Ollenburg, a lawyer with gambling debts, and his accomplice Paul Kron. Theo was held for 17 days in Ollenburg’s Düsseldorf office, but so nondescript was his appearance — he favoured cheap, ill-fitting suits — that the kidnappers demanded to see his ID to make sure they had snatched the right man. He responded by haggling over the ransom sum, which was eventually fixed at seven million Deutschmarks, and was delivered to a highway rendezvous by the Bishop of Essen. Ollenburg and Kron were caught and jailed, but only half of the money was recovered. Albrecht went to court to claim it as a tax-deductible business expense.\n\nTheodor Paul Albrecht was born in the Schonnebeck suburb of Essen, in the industrial Ruhr region, on March 28 1922, two years after his brother Karl. Their father was a miner until emphysema rendered him an invalid; their frugal, hard-working mother ran a small food shop and, in the 1930s, the two youths sold buns around the district from a wooden cart. Both served in the German army during the war: Theo with Rommel’s Afrika Corps until he was eventually captured by US troops in Italy in 1945.\n\nWhen the brothers were released from prisoner of war camps to return to Essen they found most of the city (a major railway centre which had also been the site of Krupps munitions factories) reduced to ruins, But their mother’s house and shop was intact. They began to expand the business with other grocery outlets, experimenting with a no-frills self-service format and a limited range of merchandise. Within a decade, as Germany’s economic recovery gathered pace, they owned more than 100 stores.\n\nIn 1961 they adopted the name Aldi (a contraction of Albrecht Discount) and divided the map of Germany in half — along the so-called Aldi Equator — reportedly after disagreeing over whether or not to sell cigarettes. Theo took control of Aldi Nord, still based in Essen, while Karl, reputedly the more dynamic of the duo in their younger days, ran Aldi Sud from Essen’s sister city of Mulheim.\n\nThey later divided the rest of the world, if not quite in such a logical way: Theo’s empire expanded into France, Spain, Portugal and Poland, while Karl’s eventually reached Britain and Australia. And both brothers built operations in the United States, Karl under the Aldi banner and Theo as owner of the Trader Joe’s chain of 340 “gourmet” grocery stores that he acquired in 1979.\n\nAt home in Germany the group expanded to 4,000 stores, owned via a number of legally separate operating units which allowed the brothers to co-operate when it suited them but to circumvent laws on accounting disclosure for large businesses and to avoid having to deal with a nationwide workers’ council. They ran their operations with military discipline and attention to detail, and in such secrecy that Aldi managers were forbidden not only to talk to the press but even to talk to their own colleagues in other districts.\n\nGrowth was funded out of retained profits rather than public capital-raising, and success was achieved by offering no more than a few hundred well-chosen product lines (rather than the tens of thousands found in other supermarkets) at low prices made possible by massive purchasing. This was combined with a high ratio of sales per square metre of floor space, and ferocious cost control — the latter being Theo’s special skill.\n\nLittle money was wasted on marketing, and none at all on making Aldi stores look elegant: goods were simply piled up along the aisles in packing cases. Theo himself made a point of using pencil stubs rather than expensive pens. Asked to approve the plans for a new outlet in Holland, he replied that the design was good but the paper it was drawn on was too thick: “If you use thinner paper we will save money.”\n\nA devout Roman Catholic, Theo Albrecht retired from the day-to-day running of the business in 1993, but remained active as chairman of the foundation that is Aldi Nord’s principal shareholder. He is survived by his wife Cilli, their sons Theo Jr and Berthold, who hold management positions in Aldi, and his brother Karl, now 90.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about privacy?","answers":[{"answer":"The Albrecht family is obsessed with privacy.

He began recording his own music at the age of 13.[4]\n\nNME has described his style as “psychedelic bedroom-pop”,[5] while _IQ_ sees it as “genre-bending”.[6]\n\n\nEarly life\n\nSven Gamsky was born on June 23, 1992, in Oakland, California, and grew up in Moraga, California. He is the youngest of three sons born to Dr. Tom and Berit (Fuglsang) Gamsky, and has two older brothers, Nate and Sam.[7] Sven started playing the guitar when he was in middle school.\n\nAll three of the Gamsky brothers became Eagle Scouts. Sven was a part of Moraga Boy Scout Troop 212, in which his service project toward becoming an Eagle Scout involved remodeling a garden area at Donald L. Rheem Elementary School in Moraga. The East Bay Times reported in 2010 upon his achievement of Eagle Scout that “Sven plans to travel and volunteer after high school, and eventually study psychology in college.”[8]\n\nSven Gamsky attended Campolindo High School in Moraga, graduating in 2010. While in high school, he played guitar and bass in the band “Shoot for Roots”, a band he created with fellow bandmates and classmates Cole Leksan and Jack Morris. At the beginning of their senior year, “Shoot for Roots” won a Battle of the Bands competition hosted by the Lamorinda Teen Center. They had initially come to a tie with a band called IceBox Business from rival high school, Miramonte High School, but fans from Campolindo High broke the tie by cheering louder for Gamsky's band with a recording of 116 decibels.[9]\n\n\nCareer\n\nAfter high school, Gamsky earned money by teaching guitar in the Oakland area and playing with the band Feed Me Jack at jazz clubs, festivals, and orchestra halls. He graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz in 2015, majoring in music with a classical guitar emphasis, and minoring in electronic music.[10]\n\nFrom 2011 to 2016, Gamsky was in the alternative rock/math rock band Feed Me Jack, [11][12] which released four albums before disbanding, on good terms, in 2016 for members to individually pursue their careers in music. [13][14] The following year Gamsky released a single, “Cooks”, under the stage name Still Woozy,[15][16] stating that he chose the name because of his spaced-out nature.[17] As Still Woozy, Gamsky has released an EP and several singles,[18] for which Ami Cooks created the album covers, and four music videos, the first of which was released in 2017.[19][20] Gamsky prefers to release music as soon as possible and will sometimes release a song on the same day he has finished making it.[21]\n\nA 2020 tour, which would have had 31 performances starting in May and ending in September, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[22]\n\n\nDiscography\n\nWith Feed Me Jack\n\n-   _Chumpfrey_ (2012)\n-   _Anatolia_ (2013)\n-   _Covers_ (2015)\n-   _Ultra Ego_ (2016)\n\nAs Still Woozy\n\n-   _Lately_ EP (2019)\n\nSingles\n\n-   “Vacation” (2017)\n-   “Cooks” (2017)\n-   “Wolfcat” (2017)\n-   “Goodie Bag” (2017)\n-   “Lucy” (2018)\n-   “Habit” (2019)[23]\n-   “Window” (2020)[24][25]\n-   “BS” (2020)[26]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2008/05/01/10-in-boy-scout-troop-212-receive-eagle-awards/\n\n[8] https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2009/05/28/four-moraga-scouts-are-now-eagles/\n\n[9] http://www.lamorindaweekly.com/archive/issue0315/Battle-of-the-Bands.html\n\n[10] https://takelessons.com/profile/sven-g\n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n","title":"Still Woozy"},"questions":[{"question":"Why does Still Woozy (Gamsky) release his music as soon as possible?","answers":[{"answer":"He prefers to release music as soon as possible, even releasing a song on the day he finishes writing it.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer could be more specific about why he releases his music as soon as possible.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that he does this because he wants to release music as soon as possible.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should include Gamsky's reason.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is correct, but it would be better to say that he prefers to release music as soon as possible, even releasing a song on the same day he finishes writing it.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer could be clearer in its pronoun use.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The extended answer needs to be amended to meet the length requirement","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"It is omitted that he does this because he wants to release music as soon as possible.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"Doesn't mention why he does this.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null}]}}

Both sides are about the same, when he is away from the teleprompter and going off script. There is only so much filter that can be removed when there’s hardly any filter to start with. Still, it was somewhat shocking to see Trump talking openly Thursday about something he has so far kept private: imposing the death penalty for people caught dealing drugs. “Some countries have a very, very tough penalty—the ultimate penalty,” Trump said wistfully at a White House summit on the opioid crisis. “And, by the way, they have much less of a problem.”\n\nWe’ve seen this one coming: In April, Trump called President RODRIGO DUTERTE to praise his bloody crackdown on drugs in the Philippines, which has reportedly killed as many as 12,000 people. “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,” he said, referring to Duterte’s extrajudicial, state-sanctioned murder program. “Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that.” The idea apparently stuck with Trump: Last week, Axios reported that Trump has continued privately raising the possibility of executing drug dealers, as Singapore does. “He says that a lot,” one source recalled. “He says, ‘When I ask the prime minister of Singapore do they have a drug problem [the prime minister replies,] ‘No. Death penalty.’”\n\nSenior adviser KELLYANNE CONWAY essentially confirmed the report when she clarified that Trump was merely referring to bringing capital murder charges against high-volume dealers of drugs like fentanyl, which, she pointed out, “are so lethal in such small doses.” On Thursday, Trump brought the idea out into the open, suggesting that the United States adopt “the ultimate penalty” for drug dealers.\n\nThe president’s comments fit a pattern of authoritarian rhetoric, from calling Democrats “treasonous” for not applauding his State of the Union address to pressuring the Department of Justice to prosecute his political opponents. But they also suggest a looser, less controlled Trump as the president has grown increasingly frustrated with the shackles his chief of staff, JOHN KELLY, has imposed on him. The chains began to break last month, as Kelly’s authority was rocked by allegations of domestic abuse involving his second-in-command, ROB PORTER. The scandal created a domino effect in the White House that fueled tensions between Kelly and JARED KUSHNER over Kushner’s security clearance and was a factor in the resignation of HOPE HICKS, one of Trump’s closest confidants.\n\nThe silly season has, in turn, fed a bumper crop of crazy coming out of the Oval. Trump is reportedly considering firing National Security Adviser H.R. MCMASTER, whom he also resents, and on Thursday bucked the advice of his National Economic Adviser GARY COHN and announced tariffs on steel and aluminum, causing the stock markets to plunge. For months, Trump’s senior staff had slow-walked his enthusiasm for a trade war. This week, he decided he would act unilaterally. “Trade wars are good, and easy to win,” Trump tweeted Friday morning, as the Dow Jones dropped another 350 points. This is what it looks like when the president stops being nice and starts getting real.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize everything relating to the author's opinion of Donald Trump.

He had nothing better to do. He could have picked up a magazine or disappeared into his cell phone, but he didn’t want to risk making eye contact with anyone. He wasn’t feeling up for idle chit\\-chat.\n\nThe carpet was depressing and he was having trouble labeling its color. It was unmistakably gray, but not entirely. There was a subtle tinge of brown laid overtop, like some sort of gloomy overcoat. Embedded in the mysterious shade were thin, tan stripes that raced horizontally across the floor. \n\nThe carpet now has his attention. He continued to stare at it intently, determined to brand the gray with brownish hue. \n\nAs he moved his head closer he noticed the fibers were woven from a variety of colors like, red, blue, and yellow. But as he pulled his head back he no longer saw the colorful strands. Instead, the colors blended together into the murky, grayish\\-brown he was having trouble classifying. \n\nTo pass the time he experimented with this nearsighted phenomenon by calculating how far he had to dip his head until the colored fibers became visible. After a few dips and withdraws, he determined he had to lower his head to about chest height before he could see anything but gray with a sad smear of brown. \n\nIt was at that moment he also realized how foolish he must have looked to the others in the room. Normal people were occupied with their Instagram feed or a 6\\-month old issue of Consumer Digest. \n\nWhy couldn’t I just be normal, he thought. Why couldn’t I be anywhere, but here, he thought. He picked his head up and rearranged his shoulders. \n\nNow he stared at the administrator who was seated behind a sliding glass window. The glass window was closed and the administrator had his head down. Thank God, he thought, no eye contact.\n\nBehind the administrator was a large, Master Edwards clock. It sat high enough that even if the administer were to sit upright, the entire clock face would still be visible to anyone on the other side of the sliding glass. Whoever mounted the clock must have considered the possibility that the administrator could obstruct the view of the clock face while sitting upright and therefore placed it at the appropriate height. These were his thoughts while he waited.\n\n“Mr. Blocker?”\n\nHe heard his name, but didn’t move. He maybe thought he’d only imagined someone calling his name and didn’t want to appear anxious, so he sat still.\n\n“Mr. Blocker? Are you Mr. Blocker?” the attendant called out. She was standing in an open doorway in the far righthand corner of the room. She was looking directly at him. Finally, he made eye contact with someone.\n\n“This way please.”\n\nHe rose to his feet and stuffed his hands in his trouser pockets. He took his first steps toward the door, feeling a bit defeated by the carpet. He was still unclear on its color. \n\nThe attendant lead him down a white corridor. The walls were white. The ceiling was white. The floor was white, linoleum tile. The lighting was soft, fluorescent white. He decided to stop focusing on the color white and let his mind drift to something more pleasant, the lining of his trouser pockets. \n\nHe’d always been quite satisfied with the navy suit he was wearing. The shoulders fit him perfectly. The taper of the legs was trimming and made him look taller. But the lining of the trouser pockets is what pleased him most. The lining was a soft silky material that felt fine and glossy when he rubbed it between his thumb and forefinger. \n\n“Right in here please”, the attendant directed. Her arm was outstretched, half of it inside of another room. This room was his room. This room was where he was supposed to go. He was sure of it. Not because the attendant declared it so, but because it felt right. He pulled his hands out of his pockets and entered.\n\nIn the middle of the room was a large desk. It appeared to be very old and extremely heavy. Probably oak, he thought. Behind the desk sat a man with wire\\-frame glasses. The man was staring at a computer screen. The man was at least twice his age. He could see the glare of the screen almost entirely in the man’s glasses.\n\n“Please Mr. Blocker. Have a seat.”\n\nHe did as he was told and took a seat in a chair on the opposite side of the desk.\n\n“Mr. Blocker, we are going to have to make a very difficult decision today.” \n\nHe sat in his seat and listened.\n\n“It’s my opinion that further treatments are not going improve your health.”\n\nHe extended his chin and began to nod his head. Not to appear as if he was listening, but to communicate that he understood the weight of the declaration the man in glasses had just made.\n\n“You’ve been fighting this…we’ve been fighting this for almost ten years. After five surgeries and countless rounds of chemotherapy there has been only very little progress. Of course, we could continue treatment, but your quality of life would rapidly deteriorate and the burden of cost would fall entirely on your next of kin. I sincerely believe it would be best to begin getting your affairs in order. As of today, I would estimate that you may have only a few months left.”\n\nHe sat silently with his chin still pointed toward the man with glasses. He thought about his wife. He thought about his daughters and their children. He thought about his parents who had passed many, many years ago. He thought about the white corridor with the white ceiling, the white, linoleum tiles and the white, fluorescent lights. He thought about the lining of his trouser pockets. He thought about the carpet.\n\n“Taupe!”\n\n“I’m sorry Mr. Blocker. I don’t understand,” said the man with glasses.\n\n“Gray mixed with a tinge of brown. Taupe.” he replied.\n\nHe couldn’t think of anything else to say. Instead he furrowed his brow, dipped his head, and regarded the taupe carpet with a newfound sense of familiarity and confidence.\n\nHe felt more comfortable now, having identified the mysterious color that had been eluding him. So, he lifted his hands to his face, covered his eyes with his sweat palms, and began to cry.","title":"[RF] Taupe"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the main sources of tension in the story.","answers":[{"answer":"The main source of tension in the story is the narrator's illness.

Burning is currently based out of Vancouver, British Columbia where they are completing a Bachelor of Fine Arts at Emily Carr University of Art and Design[1]\n\nTheir work incorporates themes of their upbringing, including their cultural and political background. Being a multidisciplinary artist, Burning's work combines elements of photography, video, installation, and sculpture to focus on Indigenous politics and identity from a Haudenosaunee perspective.[2] Burning has been nominated for various awards in celebration of their work such as the New Generation Photography Award[3] and was the runner-up to the 2020 Philip B. Lind Emerging Artist Prize.[4]\n\n\nArt Practice/Career\n\nLacie Burning's art is rooted in their upbringing, experiences, and identity as a Kanien'kehá:ka and Onöñda'gega Indigiqueer person. Burning’s art portrays a Haudenosaunee perspective and grapples with Indigenous relationships to land, representation and “the gaze.”[5] Burning incorporates traditional materials and fabrics, such as black velvet from traditional Mohawk regalia and practices such as beading and mask-making within their multi-media approach.[6]\n\nThe Reflection Series\n\nThe _Reflection Series_ is Burning’s most notable photography series exploring land-body reciprocity. The _Reflection Series_ was inspired by Burning’s witnessing of a land claims conflict (the [[Grand River land dispute|“Caledonia Standoff”]]) at Kanonhstaton in Six Nations of the Grand River Territory, Ontario, in 2006.[7] Burning’s experience with this conflict at age 12 spurred their political awakening and awareness of the fraught race relations between reserves and the communities that surround them.[8] The _Reflection Series_ ultimately explores the relationship between settlers and Indigenous peoples and what it means for Indigenous peoples to assert their presence on their traditional land. For the series, Burning asked themselves, “What do I look like—what does it look like—when I assert my sovereignty over the land as a [Kanien’kehá:ka] person in Caledonia?”[9] The central figure in _Reflection Piece_, who adorns a mask of mirror shards, presents an answer to this question of assertions of sovereignty through a vulnerable lens using traditional images such as masks, and juxtaposing this with the fragility of the mirrors.[10] Burning describes it as “the realization that unsettling our territories is a process that Indigenous peoples must take responsibility for alongside settlers by acknowledging internalized colonialism, reflecting upon it and actively wanting to change it.”[11] Praised by fellow artists The _Reflection Series_ has been described by Cree-Métis-Saulteaux artist Lindsay Nixon as “the haunting of a genderless ghost body, a protest on the lands that taught Burning resistance, and a disruption of the supposedly clear idea of what it means to be an Indigenous person assuredly enacting sovereignty over their lands.”[12]\n\n\nExhibits\n\nBurning’s art has been featured in a variety of exhibits across Canada. In 2016, Burning was invited to feature their work at the Mohawk Institute for the Mush Hole Project.[13] The Mohawk Institute is a former residential school, that members of Burning’s family attended. For the Mush Hole Project, Burning displayed two of their works: _Story Time_ and _Who Will Be my Witness_.[14] explores intergenerational trauma and themes of resurgence and resistance in Indigenous cultures in the face of genocidal acts such as residential schools.[15] The installation features an audio recording of residential school survivor Irene Favel speaking about her experience in a Saskatchewan school.[16] _Story Time_ was originally displayed in NE:ETH: Going Out of the Darkness in 2013 in conjunction with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, where it received acclaim in Canadian Art Magazine.[17] _Who Will Be my Witness_ is a performance and installation piece intended to promote healing within survivors and their descendants through audience engagement. The piece encourages spectators to write on the wall of the residential school and “show positivity” towards those impacted by the residential school system and its legacy.[18]\n\nIn 2018, Burning’s work was a featured exhibition in the CONTACT Photography Festival. Their exhibit _Forward Facing_ explores the intersections within Indigenous identities through photo, video, craft, and installation practices. Forward Facing was created in collaboration with fellow artists Dayna Danger and Jade Nasogaluak Carpenter.[19]\n\n\nCuratorial\n\nLacie Burning has also engaged in curatorial work. They collaborated with scholar June Scudeler on the exhibition “Unsettling Colonial Gender Boundaries” for the 2017 Queer Arts Festival.[20] This exhibition explores Indigenous experiences of gender and sexuality and brings intersectional Queer-Indigenous experiences and Two-Spirit media art to the forefront.[21] Burning and Scudeler commissioned media works and performances from artists Thirza Cuthand (Cree), Chandra Melting Tallow (Siksika), Raven Davis (Anishinaabek), and Kent Monkman (Swampy Cree) for the exhibition.[22]\n\n\nAwards and Recognitions\n\nBurning’s work has been praised by the art community through various awards celebrating its unique themes and multi-disciplinary approach. Burning was the runner-up in the 2020 Philip B. Lind Emerging Artist Prize and was awarded $1000 as a recognition of their achievement.[23] The Lind Prize is an annual award given to an emerging artist based in British Columbia working in mediums of film, photography, or video.[24] Burning was also long-listed for the New Generation Photography Award in 2020.[25] The New Generation Photography Award, established in 2017 as a partnership between the National Gallery of Canada and Scotiabank, is annually given to three artists under 30 working in lens-based art.[26] As of April 2020, the 2020 winners have yet to be announced.\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n","title":"Lacie Burning"},"questions":[{"question":"Where does Lacie Kanerahtahsohon Burning come from?","answers":[{"answer":"They are based out of Vancouver, British Columbia.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention that Burning is based out of Vancouver but is from Six Nations of the Grand River in Southern Ontario, Canada.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer should clarify that Burning is based out of Vancouver after being raised in Six Nations of the Grand River in Southern Ontario, Canada.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[0,0],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What informs Burning's career?","answers":[{"answer":"Burning's career is informed by their upbringing, experiences, and identity as a Kanien'kehá:ka and Onöñda'gega Indigiqueer person.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention the specific themes that Burning's work explores.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[null],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null}]}}

Cohen took one, lit it and inhaled deeply before contorted his face into a scowl.\n\n\"Full strength?\" He groaned, glaring at the glowing tobacco.\n\n\"You're a grown-up now,\" Chided Carville, with a humourless voice but an imperceptibly slight smile. \"You ought to smoke like one.\"\n\n\"I ought not to smoke.\" He inhaled again before acknowledging the question that Carville had not asked. \"I apologise for my lateness. But you must remember, surely? It wasn't that long ago for you. I skimmed the reports they threw at me, I shook hands with the cloying throng. I wrote the Letters of Last Resort.\"\n\n\"How was that?\"\n\n\"The Letters? Humbling.\"\n\n\"Yes. They are.\"\n\nCohen blew smoke into the night, and looked silently at Carville for a time. \"What did you write?\"\n\n\"I can't remember specifically.\"\n\n\"That's not true.\"\n\n\"No, it isn't. But I'd rather not say. Those words have been scarred into my brain these last seven years, but that's been my burden to bear. Now you get the chance. When you're where I am, you'll know that it's best for those words to die with you.\"\n\nThey were silent for a few minutes more. A night bus trundled past, and the occasional morose traveller shuffled closely behind their backs. But the two of them took no notice, staring into the churning black river beneath them.\n\n\"You're not normally this melancholy. Although I suppose under the circumstances it's understandable.\"\n\n\"What circumstances are those?\" Carville seemed genuinely curious, and Cohen suddenly felt an abiding discomfort.\n\n\"Well, you know. The results.\"\n\n\"Best news I've had in weeks.\" \n\n\"George...\"\n\n\"I'm serious, Nat. I'm not trying to soothe any latent guilt you're storing up.\"\n\n\"I don't have any.\"\n\n\"You're too soppy not to. But it really is a relief. I'm looking forward to five years as a lightweight.\"\n\n\"Remember when we were lightweights?\" Cohen was smiling now.\n\n\"Always.\" \n\n\"It feels like so long ago.\"\n\n\"It was.\"\n\n\"Will we ever have that again? Committee hearings on absolutely nothing, constituents storming into our offices to bitch and complain about stuff we've never heard of, the stupid late-night scheming. I miss it already.\" His last sentence was spoken quietly, almost involuntarily. He thought sounded pained, or awed, or sanguine. He sounded a combination of the three.\n\n\"I intend to get all that back within a few months. You'll have to wait longer, of course.\"\n\n\"Yeah. I'm starting to wonder if I made the right choice.\"\n\n\"I'm wondering the same about the electorate.\" Carville chuckled.\n\n\"Speaking of the electorate, I think I've stolen too many minutes of my life from their claws this morning.\" \n\n\"Morning? God, it's 4:15.\"\n\n\"I need to go, George.\"\n\nCarville smiled as a jaded man would smile at a dying loved one. \"I know you do. Good luck, Nat.\"\n\nCohen's eyes were ringed with circles and heavily lidded. Taking one last survey of the skyline, he replied in a forcibly deadpan monotone. \"And to you, George. I'll see you soon.\"\n\nCohen walked quickly away with his head held low. Partly by necessity, partly to disguise the emotion that had overcome him. Carville stayed for a few minutes more alone. He reasoned that nobody would seek much from an outgoing Prime Minister until morning and that his aides would handle the press appropriately. Turning his buzzing phone off, he slouched over the rail of London Bridge as the first tinges of pink started to rise alongside the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral. He smoked, and he thought of the words he had written seven years ago to be read deep in the bowels of the ocean.\n\nAt 4:32, he abruptly stood and walked away.","title":"Concession [RF]"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about Nathan Cohen?","answers":[{"answer":"Nathan Cohen is a new prime minister.

I never wanted a relationship, I told myself there was no way I'd ever consider marriage again before we met. But between all of the little things, the big things, the things others may never even notice...every single part that makes you who you are...I fell for it all. \n\nWithin 2 weeks i was in a cloud of feelings I had never remotely felt, I wasn't scared I wanted more..i wanted to feel how you made me feel everyday. The first year or so I had to downplay my feelings and thoughts, you couldn't know how I really felt. I was worried I would scare you away, I had to lie to myself and convince myself I could care less. \n\nI tried to shield and detach myself from developing feelings for liam because he wasn't my child. I tried to protect myself in case something like all of this ever happened by lying myself and not being who I truly wanted to be. It didn't last long, within a few months I found myself thinking about little things he did and thinking of something cute he said to me or did referring to me as mac. I felt like I was a superhero. \n\nNot being able to have children and not having much experience i was always deathly afraid to as much as hold a baby. I had always viewed myself as a broken misfit toy, no real grown self respecting women could ever desire to be with me for an extended period of time. I was someone maybe you would have a little fun with but never even tell your friends about let alone introduce to your parents. Of course I never thought a responsible mother would want me to be a part of raising a child, and even if she did odds are I would find a way for it to all to go terribly, things Kobra usually does. \n\nSo when all of these things occurred, and i was someone you could be proud to show off. Or watch your children, help raise them..I was on cloud nine. This was it, she is the one...I am going to get that white picket fence and family I've always secretly desired more than anything. \n\nMy life and overall outlook on life has always been unorthodox, but ultimately when I had dreams of what I wanted my future to be..it was living in a little 3 bedroom house with a white picket fence. Nothing too fancy but in a quite neighborhood. Having a loving household and above all finding this vague undefined blur that was my dream girl. \n\nI never really had any types or ideal looks of who I desired, all I knew is I wanted it to be someone that was worthy of all the love I had to give, someone sarcastic enough to confuse me regularly with jokes. Someone who had the drive to become the best version themself, to become successful in life, someone that looked at me and it was like the world stopped and began to revolve around us. \n\nThere I was having found this person, who was almost a mythical figure..progressing in our lives together..ups and downs...a myriad of tiny microscopic moments...each being the best moment in my life...over and over. Each day with her is the best day of my life….over and over. I became spoiled almost, I had stockpiled a million glances of your beautiful eyes staring into my soul...small memories that seem like almost nothing in the moment. I became spoiled...i took those for granted. I just assumed we would live happily ever after no matter what. How could we not...time passes..stress builds...money is tight...spirits are low. \n\nThe millions of microscopic moments begin to be more spread out...I still don't notice. I'm still in a fog, a feeling of invincibility that I have acquired being with you also doubles as numbness and tunnel vision. \n\nAnd here we are...would I rather things had went more like the storybook it began as...yes. I have no idea what the rest of our story entails, but one thing I know with all my heart...this isn't the way the story ends. And maybe one day our lives can become the wonderful picturesque illustration I had always dreamed about. I can only hope by reading this you begin to understand that we are meant to write the rest of the pages to this story together…..\n\nTo be continued\n\nLove,\nKobra\n\n(She reads reddit religiously so I'm hoping she sees this...I can only hope. I have always enjoyed writing but it has always been lyrics mostly. In no way do I feel I'm a competent writer I just enjoy putting my thoughts and feelings out for people to see. I hope you enjoy!

conservatives have hit back at a proposed bill that would impose harsher sentences on people performing gay ‘cure’ therapy, saying that the bill would lead to a ban on the Bible.\n\nOn April 18 the California Assembly voted to support harsher penalties for those performing gay conversion therapy in the state, opting to treat the treatment as a form of consumer fraud.\n\nBill AB-2943, which was greenlit by state lawmakers on Wednesday, would build on the existing policies to introduce a possible conviction under state law for gay ‘cure’ practitioners.\n\nPerforming gay cure therapy on minors is already is illegal in ten US states and counting, as well as Switzerland, Malta, Taiwan, two Canadian provinces, and the Australian state of Victoria.\n\nIf enacted, California would join Illinois and Connecticut in explicitly making ‘conversion therapy’ subject to consumer protection laws.\n\nGay ‘cure’ therapy has been widely debunked by multiple major medical organisations around the world.\n\nTravis Allen — a member of the California Assembly and Republican candidate for Governor — recently hit back at the state’s proposed bill, explicitly saying that it would ban the Bible in California.\n\n[]\n\nIn an interview with conservative cable news channel One America News, Allen said: “According to how this law is written, yes, it would.”\n\n“This is, you know, PC culture, politically correct culture, gone horribly awry.\n\n“This is really directly hitting at our First Amendment rights as American citizens.”\n\nRELATED: REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER CLAIMS OUTLAWING GAY CURE THERAPY WOULD ALSO BAN JESUS\n\nThe interview quickly went viral, prompting conspiracy-debunking website Snopes to challenge the idea, rating it as “false.”\n\nDespite the lack of evidence for the claim that the anti-gay cure therapy bill would ban any religious texts, many other conservatives have hit out at the bill.\n\n[Gay Cure in the (Fort Worth Weekly]\nWilhelm Joys Andersen)\nAnti-LGBT law group Alliance Defending Freedom, which has been at the forefront of the evangelical fight against gay sex, issued a memo March 8 stating that the bill was an attack on free speech.\n\nThe memo reads: “At its core, AB 2943 outlaws speech, whether offered by a licensed counsellor, a best-selling author, or even a minister or religious leader.\n\n“It targets a specific message — that an adult who is experiencing unwanted same-sex attraction or gender identity confusion can find help to address those issues — for censorship.”\n\nAlthough the memo did not specifically say that the Bible itself would be threatened, it did state that bookshops would be banned from selling texts that “challenged gender identity ideology.”\n\n“A bookstore (including online bookstores like Amazon) could not sell many recently published books challenging gender identity ideology and advocating that these beliefs should be rejected by society,” said the Alliance Defending Freedom memo.\n\nRELATED: UK GOVERNMENT FINALLY PREPARING TO ‘END THE PRACTICE’ OF GAY AND TRANSGENDER CURE THERAPY\n\nThere is no part of the bill that would prevent the sale of religious texts or other books.\n\nThe bill, submitted by out lawmaker Evan Low, would amend the section of the existing Civil Code section on fraud which deals with “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” – such as financial misrepresentation, false commercial claims and deliberate misselling to consumers – to include a prohibition on “advertising, offering to engage in, or engaging in sexual orientation change efforts with an individual”.\n\nOn April 19 the bill passed by a vote of 50 to 18 and will now head to the California State Senate for consideration.\n\n[]\n(Dr Christian Jessen investigated gay ‘cure’ therapy as part of the documentary “Cure me, I’m gay.” Photo: Channel 4)\nEvan Low, Chair of the LGBT Legislative Caucus, said: “Study after study has shown that ‘conversion therapy’ is ineffective, damaging, and counterproductive.\n\n“It is our duty to protect Californians from such deceptive practices that will expose them to physical and emotional harm.”\n\nHRC National Field Director Marty Rouse said: “Today, California legislators rightfully declared that so-called ‘conversion therapy’ is a complete sham and those who offer this deceptive and dangerous practice must be held accountable.\n\n“California was the first state to protect minors from being subjected to conversion therapy by state-licensed health care providers, and today’s vote is an important step to protecting all LGBTQ people from this debunked practice.\n\n“We thank the assembly members who voted in favour of AB 2943 and urge the Senate to swiftly advance the bill to Governor Jerry Brown’s desk.”\n\n[]\n\nConnecticut, California, Nevada, New Jersey, the District of Columbia, Oregon, Illinois, Vermont, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Washington all have laws protecting youth from gay ‘cure’ therapy, while bills are pending in a string of other states.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize Travis Allen's opinions.","answers":[{"answer":"Travis Allen is a Republican

He could hardly wait to get out of class. Mondays, and Fridays were fine because there was a small chance of him seeing her. However, on Wednesdays she was always on time. He could see it now walking out from his this room strolling down Taylor Mall. Casually looking over to his right, and there she would be in a sunflower dress with dark hair writing in her journal. He could feel it now the sun beating down on him, and the wind tickling his skin. Jeffery would spend hours every day imagining how he would ask her to a date.  Perhaps Coffee, no she wouldn’t like coffee it’s obvious she likes tea. The courage he needed wasn’t there; he couldn’t talk to girls especially beautiful ones like her. The clock was ticking away, and the professor closed his book with a loud thud. Everyone got up, and started to leave. Jeffery was so deep into though that he didn’t hear class was over so early. Looking at the clock he knew he had time to stroll around in the building. She wouldn’t be there until 12:30. \nJeffery walked out and down the hall to his right. Ahead of him was the journalist building. He thought why not pop on by, and see what they were up to. He fixed his tie, and walked in. The building was much more impressive than the criminal justice one. Newly remolded it held three floors, and a news station on top. All of the students were moving around through the building all dressed nice, and talking about current events. College always had the optimistic feel to it especially on Wednesdays. Jeffery looked around the room. I may as well take a seat, I still have ten minutes. He sat there and opened up his favorite book, and started to read. Behind him he could hear the television blaring news programs. Another new part of the build was a massive projector showing news around the clock. Give me a good book any day. \nHe wasn’t a page in when he heard “Some of the most difficult of challenges is taking the first step.” \nJeffery turned kept listening. “We have to fight for what we want, and never take no for answer. Today may be the last day we have on earth.” Jeffery was feeling something moving inside of him, a strange inspiration. “So with this last day we will love like there is no tomorrow, fight like there is no tomorrow, and live like there is no tomorrow.” YES, Jeffery thought yes that’s right I have to tell her. He turns around to see where this new motivation comes from. On the scene is black and the words come up “Ford.” Why do car commercials always have the best inspiration? His watch started to beep he looked down 12:25. This was it he was about to see her. He got up, but the inspiration he felt still lingered with him. His breathing picked up, and he started to walk at a brisk pace. This was something different this was something new. He was going to ask her to a date today. He was actually going to talk to her. He started moving faster and faster almost running to the door. He quickly opens it. I’m going to do it I can do it. He rounds the corner to Taylor mall and stops to look for her. In his excitement he began to frantically search. She wasn’t on the grass like she normally was, or on any of the benches. He felt the need to keep looking. It was Wednesday she had to be here. There was no mistake she wasn’t here. He went over to where she normally sat a small group of people were there talking. \n“Excuse me, have you seen a pretty girl with long dark hair in a Sun Flower dress?”\nThey looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders. One of the other girls sitting there spoke up to Jeffery, “What’s her name?”\nHis face went white. In all of the time that he had been dreaming about her he never knew her name. He began to run down Taylor mall in embarrassment. He reached the edge of the street. Defeated, and broken he would get on the train back to his small dorm. Today college, and Wednesday lost their hopeful optimism.  Jeffery reached back to get his train card, and realized that his wallet was missing. Perfect as if today couldn’t get any worse. He started to head back to the journalist building where he thought he lost it. We walked in, and climbed up the stairs. He got to his couch, and saw no wallet. His heart sank again. He lost his wallet, lost hope of asking the most beautiful girl out on a date, and embarrassed himself doing it. He turned to walk home when he felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned to see the prettiest girl with long dark hair in a sunflower dress standing there. He felt his heart jump for joy, and he said “Hello”\n“Your Jeffery Snipe right? I have your Wallet.”\nHe reached out and grabbed it brushing her hand he felt his heart melt some. “T-thank you, I’m Jeffery”\nShe smiled warmly “Jeff… I am Summer.” She paused for a moment looking at him warmly,  “can I tell you something Jeff?”\nJeff still bewildered nodded.

Up until the 1980s, the neighborhood was targeted for demolition to make way for an expansion of the University of Texas campus.[2] In 1983, the Blackland Community Development Corporation was formed to build, purchase and maintain housing for low-income families and special populations.[3]\n\n\nHistory\n\nBlackland was originally a farming community founded and organized in the 1800s by Swedish immigrants who settled in the area due to the rich, dark soil that was good for growing crops.[4] The neighborhood was originally known as “Blacklands”, named for the Blackland Prairie.[5] By the turn of the 20th century, much of the farmland in the neighborhood was developed with streets and houses, most of which were built far apart on large lots. In 1927, the city of Austin passed its 1928 City Plan, which mandated that social services such as schools and hospitals be made available to African-Americans, but only on the east side of East Avenue (present-day Interstate 35). Additionally, many neighborhoods in North and West Austin adopted restrictive covenants that prevented home sales to non-whites. These measures drove many African-American families to East Austin neighborhoods, including Blacklands.[6]\n\nIn the 1930s, the neighborhood's growing African-American population constructed new housing, often filling in the gaps between the neighborhood's existing far-apart homes built in the 19th Century. In the 1950s, blues musician Robert Shaw moved to the neighborhood and opened a grocery store and barbershop called the “Stop and Swat”.[7] By the 1960s, the neighborhood's name became known as “Blackland” and suffered from a lack of economic investment and disenfranchisement caused by racial discrimination.[8]\n\nIn 1965, the Texas Legislature granted the University of Texas Board of Regents approval to use eminent domain to acquire land for expanding the University. In the Spring of 1965, the University began buying individual parcels of land to the north, south, and east of the existing campus, including in the Blackland neighborhood, in hopes of using the land to relocate the University's intramural fields, baseball field, tennis courts, and parking lots.[9] Speculators bought much of the neighborhood's devalued property in order to sell it at a profit to the University. This led to cheaper rent for residents at the expense of deteriorating housing conditions.[10] The University Board of Regents focused on expansion eastward, as the east side's lower property values would lower the cost of acquisition. During the talks of annexation, the University and the City of Austin referred to Blackland neighborhood as the “Winn Tract” (named after an elementary school in the area), the “University East Project”, or the Eastern Renewal Area\".[11]\n\nIn 1980, the University announced plans to annex all the land between I-35 and Chicon Street, nearly half of the Blackland neighborhood. In 1981, the Blackland Neighborhood Association was formed to protect the Blackland residents' property rights; the neighborhood association later regrouped as the Blackland Community Development Corporation (CDC).[12] Following 12 years of negotiations, the Blackland CDC and the University reached a compromise, which allowed the University to annex the land between I-35 and Leona Street to build the Red and Charline McCombs Field and other auxiliary buildings; at the same time, the University divested all of its previously-acquired property east of Leona Street back to the Blackland CDC.[13]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n","title":"Blackland, Austin, Texas"},"questions":[{"question":"Why did most black families move to Blackland?","answers":[{"answer":"Many neighborhoods in the city of Austin adopted restrictive covenants that prevented home sales to non-whites, driving many African-American families to East Austin neighborhoods, including Blacklands.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention that the covenants were adopted in the 1920s.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"Shifting from plural to singular voice: \"Many neighborhoods in the city of Austin adopted restrictive covenants that prevented home sales to non-whites, driving many African-American families to East Austin neighborhoods, including Blacklands.\"","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer could be more specific about the covenants.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that Blackland was also close to downtown Austin.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[0,null,null,0],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What are the reasons behind the University of Texas' divestments of its Blackland properties?","answers":[{"answer":"The University of Texas wanted to expand its campus eastward.

My dad never got around to it. The only bands he’d ever listen to were the Beatles and Rolling Stones. He wanted the Beatles played at his funeral, which he got. My mom never talks about the music that she listens to  except for her uncle Alan who toured the Midwest in the 50’s as a troubadour;  he’s still famous in our town.\n\tI haven’t been home in a while, not that I miss it much. I moved to LA when I was 23. I was bored by the people, bored by my job at the grocery store and tired of not seeing anything happening. When I moved I had most of my” LA-experiences” during the first six months, right drugs- wrong people, that sort of thing. I thought the substances would inspire me as it seemed to inspire others but that never happened. I also played some gigs with local small-timers but it never amounted to much.\n\tMy fourth summer in LA came around and thats when I met Terrie outside a used-car shop. I’d been looking to replace dad’s station-wagon that I’d driven to the coast.As  I was standing there looking over some of my options I saw the glint of peroxide-blonde hair and sweaty fish-net stockings out of the corner of my eye. I remember the coral lipstick, which I later learned was her favorite, so shiny on those lips. She walked up to me to bum a cigarette. As I’d recently quit smoking I apologized and told her I didn’t have any on me. Disappointed, she asked me for a lighter to borrow if she could bum a smoke from a man that was standing by a newsstand across the street. I didn’t have a lighter either but I reached into my vest pocket for the book of matches I always kept there. As I handed it to her she thanked me and smiled in the most heartbreaking manner that I knew that I had to make her mine. Although I was more of what you might call the singer-songwriter type than a rocker this girl with her glam rock look was something else. Underneath that done up exterior I could see that she was pretty in an old-fashioned way. Later, when we were married, I used to tell her that she was like a burning wheat field blowing in the summer wind; she never understood what I meant. Our courtship was fast on because on account of her parents being strictly religious. Terrie was only 21 when we married but they consented and gave us their blessing because I was “a good God-fearing Midwestern boy.”\n\t\n\tThrough Terrie I got more involved in the rock scene and discovered I had a knack for writing catchy riffs. I joined one of the local outfits who were in need of a guitarist and shortly after that we played as support band for one of the west coasts most famous bands on their US tour. Crazy days of touring and debauchery followed but after rising tensions in the band and disagreements with our management we decided to call it quits.\n\tThen Terrie got pregnant. She was excited but seeing as her job at the record store didn’t pay much and my being unemployed, I was worried to say the least. Fortunately I lucked out in joining as a touring and studio session guitarist with a band that had just signed a big deal with a major label. Unfortunately this mean being on the road for long stretches at a time. things quickly went downhill in our relationship and it was while touring in Japan that I got the terrible news that Terrie had suffered a miscarriage. She was inconsolable and quit her job. I tried to be home as much as I could to care for her but my contractual obligations took me out of town again. things between us never recovered after that and I blame myself for that. Two months after the loss of our child iÍ got a call from Roy, a sergeant in the Marines who tells me he’s in love with my wife and she is in love with him and they are going to Germany. While this news hurt at first I can’t say I was surprised; I kept my nose to the grind to give me something else to think about. One tour lead to another and after 5 years the band went through a lineup change and I was thrust into the role of frontman. Evidently I did something right as we quickly started selling out the largest arenas and stadiums. We got through 3 good tours before ticket sales started to dwindle. These days we play to fairly large clubs and such, I don’t complain, seeing as it brings in good money. I live a private and enjoyable life.\n\tI’ve never met Terrie since our marriage ended but last I heard Roy was killed in a combat exercise and she had gotten remarried to a journalist. Even though our relationship went to pieces I still cherish terrie and our times together. \n\tAt the venues we play the band usually has extensive requirements to ensure their comfort. My only requests on the rider are one ham sandwich and two fingers of bourbon. I usually go out into whichever city we’re playing that night and walk around while eating my sandwich. Even though the band is still fairly popular people seldom recognize me off the stage. I also try to find a bookstore to buy something by a local author for those long flights and bus rides. Just before showtime I’ll find a quiet spot in the venue and toast my parents, my hometown and my Terrie.\n","title":"First Short story post(sorry bout the amount of suckiness) "},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story say about the narrator's success as a musician.","answers":[{"answer":"He belonged to local outfits in the music scene, and then he joined another band as a touring and session guitarist.

The merciless July heat tapered off as a welcome breeze lightly caressed my cheek. If a person stood in the shade for too long, they might have mistaken it for a perfect spring day. The birds were singing. It felt fantastic to be alive but it was a saccharine moment. An ugly storm was on the horizon.\n\nPrior to that, I’d been sipping cool lemonade on the front porch in my Adirondack chair. I heard a distant thunderclap which threatened to quash the temperate afternoon fantasy. The approaching storm drifted closer and I wondered if it was cause for alarm. Living in ‘tornado alley’, it’s always in the back of my mind. The clouds turned dark purple and then an ugly shade of gray. Only in hindsight did I learn what terror it carried within.\n\nNot wanting to get soaked, I went inside to avoid the upcoming cloud burst. No sooner than I had closed the door, heavy droplets started pinging the rooftop. The melodic tempo was soothing at first but as the intensity increased, its gentle rhythm was lost. Not only did the rain intensify, but the atmospheric theatrics took my breath away. Angry bolts of lightning menaced the sky. I was glad to be inside.\n\nThen the hail came. First it was mixed with rain. It would’ve been easy to mistake it for just larger raindrops. Soon however, the ice pellets were the size of golf balls. They savagely pounded the roof. Then I heard my car windshield shatter from the merciless barrage. Even my house windows were not immune. They were under attack as the wind flung the frozen projectiles sideways at them.\n\nA look out of my picture window brought a far worse sight. In the distance was the unmistakable shape of a deadly funnel. It slowly descended to the ground and started destroying everything in its wake. I judged it to be less than two miles away and closing fast. At that distance, I couldn’t outrun it and risked fleeing directly into it’s path, if it changed direction. I had to take cover at home and hope for the best. \n\nThe storm grew so ferocious I feared my house would collapse before the tornado even arrived. The walls shook and shuddered. The rising wail of a ‘train whistle’ filled the air. I opened up the windows since they would blow out if the inside wasn’t depressurized. I prepared for the inevitable. Death was on a collision course and nothing could stop it from happening. It slithered toward me as if to wipe away my entire existence. I strongly suspected it might do just that. A thousand bittersweet memories flooded my mind. The roar of the whirling wind drowned out my screams until the maelstrom arrived at my doorstep.\n\nIn the eye of the tornado I had a moment of clarity amid the chaos. I watched as debris flew by in a blur. I fully expected to see my roof fly off and the walls shred away. Instead, a pale column of smoke began to seep in through the open window. My fear was already at the limits of human endurance. I was too distracted about the immanent devastation to worry about a strange fog swirling around my home. That is, until it began to separate into distinctively humanoid shapes! \n\nBefore my disbelieving eyes, three faceless forms hovered and drifted around the room. The unexplained ‘wraiths’ almost seemed to be assessing the situation. Were they supernatural agents of death? Was the tornado a vehicle for them; or was the storm itself their physical manifestation? Whether they were angels or demons from Hell, I didn’t know. Obviously I tried to avoid drawing any attention to myself. I couldn’t imagine things getting worse than having to deal with a mindless twister but having three spirits officiate it upped the ante. \n\nRegardless of my stealth, they knew I was there; cowering in the corner for a completely new reason. There was a brief hesitation among them as they descended upon me. I could hear shingles being torn from the roof but my sole focus was those three uninvited guests, hovering less than ten feet away. It was positively terrifying. I’ve never been a religious man but it was impossible to deny the supernatural event unfolding in my living room. The irony is that I didn’t expect to survive long enough to share my experience. \n\nMy three visitors were stationary for the moment. I felt their somber attention upon me but with no eyes, there was nowhere to focus my view. Their faceless gaze and ashen features chilled me to the bone. I sensed that I was being judged. To what degree or for what reasons, I had no idea. I did my best to project an air of innocence, good will and benevolence. How I came to be faced with not one, but two deadly trials in a single day, I couldn’t imagine. \n\nIn perhaps the most expressive form of non-verbal communication I had ever seen, the ethereal ‘judge’ to my left slowly turned a downy shade of virgin white. The full meaning of this gesture escaped me until the middle ‘judge’ also changed its translucent hue. To my great dismay, to that of a blackened lump of coal. Of the three overseers present, it appeared I had one vote for, and one vote against me in this macabre tornado court. \n\nIt seemed like an eternity until the final judgment was rendered. Slowly, the third otherworldly spirit took on the same light coloration as the first. The symbolic message I took from the proceeding was that I had been exonerated by a narrow majority vote. The three ‘judges’ drifted back into one unified pillar of smoke and left just as ‘it’ had come. \n\nOutside, the tornado dissipated back to nothingness. The sky above cleared back to normal in a matter of minutes. With the exception of an obvious trail of destruction leading straight to my home, I could hardly believe it even happened. It was like a bad dream. I’m eternally thankful that the three storm judges were favorable to me.

The building which was 4 storeys tall, was completed in 1916 and at that time it also housed the Singapore Chamber of Commerce and Exchange.[10]\n\nConstruction of a 44 storey tall skyscraper at Battery Road for the bank's head office was completed in 1984. The building, which was known as the Standard Chartered Building, was the largest Standard Chartered building worldwide and it also represented the largest single investment by a British company at that point of time.[11] Officially opened on 24 October 1984 by Anthony Barber, then chairman of the Standard Chartered Bank, the building stood on the site of the bank's first branch when it was first opened in 1859.[12] In 1986, Khoo Teck Puat, the founder of Maybank acquired a significant stake for US$100 million in the bank's parent, Standard Chartered and later became the single largest shareholder of the banking group.[13][14] Following his death in 2004, the stake valued at £2.3 billion was acquired by Temasek Holdings in 2006, making the investment arm of the Government of Singapore its largest shareholder.[15]\n\n2000s to present: Local incorporation\n\nIn 2007, Standard Chartered opened its private banking global headquarters in Singapore[16] and in 2011, the bank moved its Singapore cooperate office to the Marina Bay Financial Centre, after being situated in Raffles Place since 1859.[17] On October 7, 2013, Standard Chartered officially incorporated a local subsidiary of the bank, STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (SINGAPORE) LIMITED. Following the incorporation, the bank's Singapore Consumer Banking retail and SME banking business was transferred to the new subsidiary.[18] In 2018, the operations of Standard Chartered was eventually merged into Standard Chartered Singapore, consolidating all of the group's Singapore operations and becoming the first major foreign bank to do so in Singapore.[19]\n\n\nBanking services\n\nConsumer Banking\n\n-   Deposit and Savings accounts\n-   Credit Cards\n-   Loans\n-   Mortgages\n-   Investments\n-   Insurance\n\nCooperate banking\n\n-   Accounts and Cash Management\n-   Loans & Government services\n-   Business insurance\n\n\nStandard Chartered Singapore Marathon\n\nBeginning in 1982, the Singapore Marathon, also known as the Standard Chartered Marathon, is an annual international marathon held on the first Sunday of every December.

He began his career as a congressional aide to Donald M. Fraser during Fraser's last two terms in the United States House of Representatives. After attending Columbia Law School, Rapson joined the law firm of Leonard, Street & Deinard to practice law while also serving on the board of several organizations. In 1989, Fraser, who had become mayor of Minneapolis, appointed Rapson as his deputy mayor and, in 1993, Rapson unsuccessfully ran for mayor to succeed Fraser.\n\nAfter leaving the Minneapolis City Hall, Rapson became a fellow at the University of Minnesota and then was appointed president of the McKnight Foundation in Minneapolis. In 2006, he moved to the Detroit area to become CEO of the Kresge Foundation. He has led the foundation in a number of philanthropic endeavors to revitalize and rescue Detroit from bankruptcy.\n\n\nEarly life and education\n\nRichard “Rip” Rapson[1] was born on March 16, 1952,[2] in Bonn, Germany,[3] to Mary and Ralph Rapson.[4] In 1954, the family moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Ralph became head the University of Minnesota School of Architecture[5] and a prolific architect in the city.[6] Mary said that their son was nicknamed Rip because he was “kicking and moving” even in the womb.[7] He has a younger brother, Thomas (“Toby”), who also became an architect at their father's architectural firm.[8][9]\n\nAt Marshall-University High School, Rip Rapson was a baseball pitcher, played basketball, tennis and learned to play the trumpet.[10] He chose to attend Pomona College in California which he believed had a good tennis team.[11] In 1974, he graduated magna cum laude from Pomona with a bachelor of arts degree in political science.[12]\n\n\nCareer\n\nAfter college, Rapson was hired by Arvonne Fraser, who ran her husband Donald M. Fraser's offices in Washington, D.C., when he served as a United States Representative from Minnesota.[13] Rapson was a congressional aide from 1974 to 1978 during Fraser's last two terms in the U.S. congress.[14][15] He worked as a liaison between Fraser's Washington office and his local district office in Minneapolis as well as contributing to the writing and passage of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act of 1978 to protect the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota.[16][17]\n\nRapson then graduated from Columbia Law School with a J.D.[18][19] and joined the law firm of Leonard, Street & Deinard. He became a partner at the firm[20][21] and remained there from 1981 to 1988.[22] He also served on the Library Board, the Board of Estimates and Taxation, and the boards of 13 other organizations in the city during that period.[23]\n\nOn March 14, 1989, Fraser, who had become mayor of Minneapolis, appointed Rapson as his deputy mayor, effective April 15, 1989, to succeed Jan Hively. As deputy mayor, Rapson was in charge of liasoning with the Minneapolis City Council.[24] He was also responsible for the creation of a $400 million Neighborhood Revitalization Program and chaired its implementation committee.[25][26]\n\nRapson ran in the 1993 Minneapolis mayoral elections against Richard Jefferson, a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, and Sharon Sayles-Belton, president of the city council.[27][28] Rapson relied on a grassroots campaign, receiving only 4% of his funding from political action committees.[29]\n\nAfter his unsuccessful bid for mayor of Minneapolis, Rapson accepted a senior fellowship at the University of Minnesota.[30] He then served for six years as president of the McKnight Foundation in Minneapolis.[31]\n\nIn 2006, Rapson was appointed CEO of the Kresge Foundation, a foundation based in Troy, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit.[32] He was responsible for a number of large grant programs made by the foundation including a $100-million grant to bring financial stability to the Detroit Institute of Arts whose art collection was owned by the city when it went bankrupt in 2013 and was being considered for sale to cover the city's debt.[33] Together with Gerald Rosen, a U.S. district court chief judge. and Darren Walker of the Ford Foundation which chipped in another $125 million,[34] Rapson helped organize a “grand bargain” as proposed by Judge Rosen,[35][36] with other contributions from a number of foundations and the state of Michigan, to keep the art collection from being liquidated and help preserve pensions for city retirees, whose retirement funds were also at risk.[37]\n\n[Rapson at the May 2017 opening of the QLine streetcar in Detroit, Michigan] Under his leadership, the foundation contributed $150 million to the implementation of the Detroit Future City plan to revitalize the city[38][39] and also spurred the development of the QLine streetcar project in downtown Detroit.[40][41] Rapson is a founding member on the board of directors of M-1 Rail, a non-profit organization which built, owns, and operates the QLine.[42][43][44] He also serves on the Detroit board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.[45] As CEO of the Kresge Foundation, as of 2017, Rapson manages the organization's $3.8 billion in assets and 105 full-time employees.[46]\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nRapson married Gail Johnson in August 1989.[47] They have two children.[48]\n\n\nBibliography\n\n-   -   \n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n\n[18] \n\n[19] \n\n[20] \n\n[21] \n\n[22] \n\n[23] \n\n[24] \n\n[25] \n\n[26] \n\n[27] \n\n[28] \n\n[29] \n\n[30] \n\n[31] \n\n[32] \n\n[33] \n\n[34] \n\n[35] \n\n[36] \n\n[37] \n\n[38] \n\n[39] \n\n[40] \n\n[41] \n\n[42] \n\n[43] \n\n[44] \n\n[45] \n\n[46] \n\n[47] \n\n[48] \n","title":"Rip Rapson"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story say about Rapson's career?","answers":[{"answer":"After getting a bachelor degree in political science from Pomona college, he was hired by Arvonne Fraser to work in her husband's congressman's office.

Thunder rolled and boomed, as lightning lit up the skies. Below, the salty waves tossed and tumbled, growing larger as the wind whipped and raged from the north. The rain came down in torrents, pelting the deck of the wooden ship, and soaking the wood. The first mate barked out orders to the crew who busied themselves to carry those orders out. The sails were taken in, so as to not be blown off course. The idea was to wait out the storm, as the waves weren’t so bad that they needed to get out of danger. Near the bow, on top deck, a woman cloaked in a silver robe stood by a man who was robbed in royal purple. Both had crowns fastened to their heads. Soldiers stood by, on edge from the storm, but otherwise relaxed. The man smiled down at his wife and looked to the small bundle of joy she held in her arms. A small child, nearly a year old, rested against her mother’s breast. She had dark, nearly obsidian black hair. Her emerald green eyes were closed now, resting while the storm raged on around them. Her little fingers curled tightly around her mother’s necklace. Their calm was shattered by the sound of lightning as it hit the main mast. The following boom of thunder was loud enough to wake the dead. Deckhands scrambled as they tried to put out the fire that was quickly spreading, but another bolt of lighting struck the ship near the stern, and soon they understood their battle with the flames was a lost cause. The captain readied the life boats, and had the king and queen begin to board. A large wave crashed into the side of the ship and the queen and her child were sent flying over the side. The life boat was lowered down into the unforgiving seas. The queen tried to stay close to the boat, but between holding her child’s head above the waves and the weight of her attire, she was quickly losing strength. She felt something brush up against her. The queen was so tired at this point, her arm holding her child threatened to release her. She saw the life boat coming for her, she knew she would be safe soon. But her child.. Suddenly she felt her child being taken from her arms, as if the water itself was wishing her to drop the child. She screamed up at the skies to whatever god might be listening. \n\n“Save my baby, please! Save my Allene!” \n\nSomething came up from the waves, a sleek head, covered in scales, long like a horse’s. two horns upon the top of it’s head that looked like blackened icicles, Nearly glowing blue orbs seemed to bring the queen into a state of shock. This was a water dragon. Feared for their ever-changing moods, and loved for their kindness. The desperate mother, without a thought, handed her child up to the dragon, who took it in it’s maw gently. But as the life boats came closer, the dragon’s eyes became a glare. There was a man raging in the small life boat, he was screaming out of fear, and waved a sword in the air. The dragon gave a deep growl and sunk below the waves. \n\nThe queen screamed in horror as she watched her baby disappear beneath the black waves, her strength gave out and she began to sink, hoping to join her child in a watery grave. Large hands pulled at her soaked body before she could embrace the darkness that surrounded her and she was pulled into the chaos of life. She sobbed openly as her king held her, the dread and hatred in his eyes was enough to keep the crew silent while they worked on getting everyone safely to shore. The closest line of safety being Conach Moore, an island that held many mountains. On the eastern side there was a small village that would be able to help them get home to Riochtdome. \n\nBeneath the unforgiving waves, in the calm depths of the ocean, the water dragon still carried the young child in it’s maw, a protective barrier surrounded it so that water did not enter the child’s lungs. The dragon had sensed darkness in the King’s heart and sought to save both the mother and the child, but when she had looked for the mother, the king was already pulling her with him. With a heavy heart she took the child to her home, Farlig Dyre. It was a rather large island, filled with forests, mountains, rivers, and plains. It was a beautiful land where Humans dared not tread, and Dragons lived peacefully. She swam up to the edge of the massive cliff that served as a shoreline, digging her claws into the rough earth as she hauled her long, lithe body up the mountainous wall. Her deep blue scales dripped water and left a wet trail as she climbed over the wall and onto the soft lush grass of the northern forest. She placed the now awake, and yet peaceful child, onto the ground. She held her massive head to the sky and beckoned her elders with a roar. As she waited for the sounds of familiar wings beating against the wind, she gathered a few logs and used her claw to dig a small, shallow hole She placed the logs inside and lit a fire with her maw. Her fire was blue, but unlike most fires, it wasn’t as hot as it should be. It was warm, like a sunny day rather than a bursting inferno. She placed the child near the edge of it so as to keep it warm, spreading one of her small wings over her so as to keep her dry. She curled herself up around the child the mother had called Allene, and looked to the skies, awaiting the judgment of her elders.","title":"[FN]Dawn of Darkness: The Beginning"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the climactic event of the story.","answers":[{"answer":"The climax of the story is when the water dragon saves the queen and her child from the sinking ship.

Enough to last the whole recon mission. It’s been long enough now that the sound of my own thoughts is slowly driving me crazy. Outside Observation is just space. Space as far as the eye can see. Dotted with stars smaller than a baby's laugh. A sea of stillness spreading out forever. \n\nJust below me is Judas 5. The star I was sent here to check out. Do a full orbit, they said, scan the planets in the system for atmosphere, water, plant life, etcetera, then shoot the retros and get the hell back here. Easy peasy. Simple simple simple. Simple mission. All I really had to do was sit in this cramped space for half a year, twiddle my thumbs, catch up on my reading, and keep myself in shape. The computers handled everything, mostly. They auto-guidance systems guided. The auto-detector system detected. Then once the six months was up I just pressed the big shiny button on the dashboard and I’d be home before I knew it.  \n\nI wondered how Anita was doing. Dating was hard for Nauts. Noughts. We were literally out of this world for months, years at a time. Dating outside the agency was a nightmare. Wait, so you’re telling me I get to see you one week in fifty-two? And you’re looking for something serious? Riiiiight, yeah not gonna work. Long distance? What a joke. Dating within the agency was hell as well. Sure you find a nice girl, cute, smart (or course), fit. She likes you. You like her. You ask her out. You go out. She gets deployed to Ulysses 12 or whatever. Best case scenario, she goes out alone, not knowing when she’ll be back, and you get sent out on your own mission to god knows where, and you two somehow manage to sync your timetables. Somehow. Unlikely though. Worst case scenario she gets sent out with mister Joe Beefpecs and gets hooked up while on mission. It’s only natural. Half a year in a cramped little room with only one other person for company? Sex is a no brainer of a time passer.   \n\nAnyway Anita. This girl I’d met a while back. Cute. Smart. Kind of a sarcastic chick. Funny though. She said she was fine with my job, but if I get back and she’s moved on I wouldn’t be surprised. Six months is a long time to be away from home.   \n\nHome. A little apartment in the city, round the corner from this nice little café no one knows about. A quiet little space in a city that never shuts up. An empty room in a place bursting at the seams with people. Some nauts didn’t see the point of living off-base. Didn’t see the point of getting attached to earthbounds. Earthbound people, earthbound places, they mean. Kept their rooms on base bare because they never had time to decorate. I guess I see their point. If I’m away ninety percent of the time there really is no point buying a place of my own. But I dunno. I kind like that, the fact that I’ve got a little place tucked away, just for me. Maybe I’m just sentimental like that.  \n\nThe Solitude. Shuttles as a rule didn’t get names. I know they used to name them all – Discovery, Challenger, whatever – but these days they were just given codes. ATS, PNB, RT7, FUBAR etc. This hunk of twenty-year old junk was named DSSS 92 back in the heyday of the agency, when we could afford to send ninety two of the fuckers out there. Out here. Into space. Deep space surveyor shuttle ninety two. Really captures the imagination. So I thought, yknow what, I’ve been on enough recons with this little guy to deserve to name him. Her. It. Whatever.   \n\nSolitude. Original I know. But I guess I might as well. What with the air situation and all.   \n\nOh. That. Yeah.   \n\nCaptains log number one. Number last.   \n\nDay ninety-two.   \nThe DSSS solitude.   \nA long way from home.  \nRetros are busted. Got hit by a freak shower a couple months back. Meteor, not rain. Been orbiting this sun for near on two months now. Air running out. No response from Terra.   Looks like I’m on my own. No surprises there.   \n\nI  \n\nI don’t know what else to say. It’s not like I’m leaving anyone behind after all.   \n  \n...  \n  \nOh yeah. my mission.  \n...  \n\nNo habitable zones found surrounding Judas 5.  \nNo signs of life in surveyed area.  \nMission status complete.

He had nothing better to do. He could have picked up a magazine or disappeared into his cell phone, but he didn’t want to risk making eye contact with anyone. He wasn’t feeling up for idle chit\\-chat.\n\nThe carpet was depressing and he was having trouble labeling its color. It was unmistakably gray, but not entirely. There was a subtle tinge of brown laid overtop, like some sort of gloomy overcoat. Embedded in the mysterious shade were thin, tan stripes that raced horizontally across the floor. \n\nThe carpet now has his attention. He continued to stare at it intently, determined to brand the gray with brownish hue. \n\nAs he moved his head closer he noticed the fibers were woven from a variety of colors like, red, blue, and yellow. But as he pulled his head back he no longer saw the colorful strands. Instead, the colors blended together into the murky, grayish\\-brown he was having trouble classifying. \n\nTo pass the time he experimented with this nearsighted phenomenon by calculating how far he had to dip his head until the colored fibers became visible. After a few dips and withdraws, he determined he had to lower his head to about chest height before he could see anything but gray with a sad smear of brown. \n\nIt was at that moment he also realized how foolish he must have looked to the others in the room. Normal people were occupied with their Instagram feed or a 6\\-month old issue of Consumer Digest. \n\nWhy couldn’t I just be normal, he thought. Why couldn’t I be anywhere, but here, he thought. He picked his head up and rearranged his shoulders. \n\nNow he stared at the administrator who was seated behind a sliding glass window. The glass window was closed and the administrator had his head down. Thank God, he thought, no eye contact.\n\nBehind the administrator was a large, Master Edwards clock. It sat high enough that even if the administer were to sit upright, the entire clock face would still be visible to anyone on the other side of the sliding glass. Whoever mounted the clock must have considered the possibility that the administrator could obstruct the view of the clock face while sitting upright and therefore placed it at the appropriate height. These were his thoughts while he waited.\n\n“Mr. Blocker?”\n\nHe heard his name, but didn’t move. He maybe thought he’d only imagined someone calling his name and didn’t want to appear anxious, so he sat still.\n\n“Mr. Blocker? Are you Mr. Blocker?” the attendant called out. She was standing in an open doorway in the far righthand corner of the room. She was looking directly at him. Finally, he made eye contact with someone.\n\n“This way please.”\n\nHe rose to his feet and stuffed his hands in his trouser pockets. He took his first steps toward the door, feeling a bit defeated by the carpet. He was still unclear on its color. \n\nThe attendant lead him down a white corridor. The walls were white. The ceiling was white. The floor was white, linoleum tile. The lighting was soft, fluorescent white. He decided to stop focusing on the color white and let his mind drift to something more pleasant, the lining of his trouser pockets. \n\nHe’d always been quite satisfied with the navy suit he was wearing. The shoulders fit him perfectly. The taper of the legs was trimming and made him look taller. But the lining of the trouser pockets is what pleased him most. The lining was a soft silky material that felt fine and glossy when he rubbed it between his thumb and forefinger. \n\n“Right in here please”, the attendant directed. Her arm was outstretched, half of it inside of another room. This room was his room. This room was where he was supposed to go. He was sure of it. Not because the attendant declared it so, but because it felt right. He pulled his hands out of his pockets and entered.\n\nIn the middle of the room was a large desk. It appeared to be very old and extremely heavy. Probably oak, he thought. Behind the desk sat a man with wire\\-frame glasses. The man was staring at a computer screen. The man was at least twice his age. He could see the glare of the screen almost entirely in the man’s glasses.\n\n“Please Mr. Blocker. Have a seat.”\n\nHe did as he was told and took a seat in a chair on the opposite side of the desk.\n\n“Mr. Blocker, we are going to have to make a very difficult decision today.” \n\nHe sat in his seat and listened.\n\n“It’s my opinion that further treatments are not going improve your health.”\n\nHe extended his chin and began to nod his head. Not to appear as if he was listening, but to communicate that he understood the weight of the declaration the man in glasses had just made.\n\n“You’ve been fighting this…we’ve been fighting this for almost ten years. After five surgeries and countless rounds of chemotherapy there has been only very little progress. Of course, we could continue treatment, but your quality of life would rapidly deteriorate and the burden of cost would fall entirely on your next of kin. I sincerely believe it would be best to begin getting your affairs in order. As of today, I would estimate that you may have only a few months left.”\n\nHe sat silently with his chin still pointed toward the man with glasses. He thought about his wife. He thought about his daughters and their children. He thought about his parents who had passed many, many years ago. He thought about the white corridor with the white ceiling, the white, linoleum tiles and the white, fluorescent lights. He thought about the lining of his trouser pockets. He thought about the carpet.\n\n“Taupe!”\n\n“I’m sorry Mr. Blocker. I don’t understand,” said the man with glasses.\n\n“Gray mixed with a tinge of brown. Taupe.” he replied.\n\nHe couldn’t think of anything else to say. Instead he furrowed his brow, dipped his head, and regarded the taupe carpet with a newfound sense of familiarity and confidence.\n\nHe felt more comfortable now, having identified the mysterious color that had been eluding him. So, he lifted his hands to his face, covered his eyes with his sweat palms, and began to cry.","title":"[RF] Taupe"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the main sources of tension in the story.","answers":[{"answer":"The main sources of tension at the end of the story are Blocker's health and the fact that it seems inevitably that the illness will kill Blocker eventually, and Blocker's desire to be well enough to see his loved ones again.","critiques":[{"critique":"The response is missing the tension of Blocker's time in the hospital.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer omits the tension of Blocker's isolation.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The first part covers Blocker's actual illness and prognosis.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer omits the tension of Blocker's social anxiety.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The first sentence is inaccurate.

She had dark black hair that drooped down her face and pale white skin much like Adam. He got up out of bed to change into his black jumpsuit; the same jumpsuit that everyone wore except his had a unique number, it read 77689. Towards the bathroom, he walked with a slouched back and a slight limp following a factory accident he had a month ago. A feeling of anger came over him but quickly subsided; he remembered the doctor telling him to control his thoughts and emotions.  \n\n“Breakfast looks good,” he said with a cold smile, it was a hot metal bowl of oatmeal and honey. The same food everyone got for their rations, the government provided the food, everyone got equal treatment. At the table sat Adams only son Tim, a gaunt ghoulish boy with razor-sharp cheekbones and hollow eyes.    \n\n“I hate this food,” Tim said spinning his spoon around the bowl, making a horrid screeching sound.   \n\n“Stop that,” his mum groaned looking as equally fed up of the cuisine.  \n\n“Don’t complain about the food, we should be thankful that we’re eating a hot meal,” Adam insisted, something inside of him didn’t feel right but he carried on slurping up the oatmeal. He looked past the drab and grey walls into the window where the sun stood far out of reach. “Let's get going, we don’t want to miss the news,” Adam sighed, as he got up the old wooden chair screamed being dragged across the wood floor.   \n\nThe door creaked open as the family stepped out, the smoke-filled air heated up Adams throat drying it up like an Arabian desert. His lungs now used to the air no longer rejected it instead suffered from every burning breath. The taste was like burning hair which dried up the mouth. Stark houses stood only meters apart to accommodate the growing population. Now at the Town Center, he looked at the posters which hung up on telephone poles ‘Vote for Venessa Cooper 2078’, the same burning anger from earlier crept up his insides but like a fire extinguisher was put out by an irrational wave of fear. The endless sea of people stood around them, a flowing river of bodies. EEEEEEE the siren screeched, and silence quickly came to take its place. The silence hung in the air like a heavy fog but was disturbed by a flash.   \n\n“This is not your daily news broadcast, we call ourselves M0XERS,” the huge screen which usually displayed the news now projected a man with a deep monotone voice. He looked different as his face was not gaunt but was instead colourful and round, he had a dark brown beard that resembled a rainforest, his bare head scrunched up when he spoke. “We are here to liberate you from the prison you live in,” he declared, his tone so serious but warming. All eyes were on the screen then a group of dark masked figures abseiled down the screen. As people watched in curiosity the red paint quickly made out the word ‘freedom’.  \n\nThe heavy silence was pierced by the yelling and hissing of people chanting “This is the hate of the old age!” The man on the screen looked in horror, suddenly the door behind him opened with a loud bang. Flashing white was followed by the sound of gunshots and screams. Silence once again covered the town center like a blanket of fog, when the dust cleared all that was left were bodies. A soldier dressed in all white appeared on screen then all went blank.   \n\n“We need to get out of here,” Adam said as he pulled his family away from the sea of people. Gunshots could be heard as a large military truck the size of two school buses plowed through the group of masked individuals. Gas was thrown at the crowd to disperse them. Everything slowed down, it felt as if someone stabbed him and pulled out his stomach. People were running and screaming as people began getting caught in the crossfire, he looked back and froze.   \n\nBreaths began coming to him but only in slow rattling gasps. His breathing would stop only to emerge like a drowning victim coming up for their last breath. His family still life clawed out of them into the cold hands of death. He looked at the word freedom now barely visible, covered in blood like a 1st graders painting.   \n\n“Go home or you will be shot!” the speaker blasted; this startled all the people still frozen in place to run like birds from a rock. Adam ran to in fear of his life, was he a coward to do so he thought. Nausea clawed at his throat he felt a strong contraction in his stomach, a vile acidic taste filled his mouth as he looked down only to see vivid yellow bile with chunks of oats.   \n\nThe door creaked open and the coldness from the house felt like nails down his spine. His crying was both ferocious and noisy. He blinked briny tears from bloodshot eyes, his thick lashes stuck together in clumps as if he'd been swimming. The tears made wet tracks down his face and dripped from his stubbled, wobbling chin. He lay down needles sliced through every inch of his body the pain was too much, his eyes felt heavy like warm blankets.  He let his consciousness ebb away into the escape which was the darkness.   ","title":"[RF] School short story can't think of a title and need help with grammar :)"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the feelings the characters in the text have about the food served to them.","answers":[{"answer":"Tim, the son, hates the food and complains about it.

After cleaning up in the kitchen, I remember hearing a cough coming from the basement. My initial thought was to get the baby and leave but strangely enough I did not. However, I did continue with whatever needed to be done with the house. \n\tFor the next few days, this has continued until I spoke with your husband. Yes, this may seem strange and very disrespectful but your husband had deep secrets. He told me that a close friend of his was staying over for awhile until he gets a new place. The guy name is Riley. He’s a yellow skinned man, with high cheekbones, black curly hair, with dark brown eyes. Also, he smoked these skinny, black cigarettes. Although I was skeptical at first, I still decided that it was okay.\n\tBut as days passed, I felt as if there were more eyes on me than usual. Paranoia has stricken me while being in that house. Unfortunately, it did not stop me from sleeping when being there. It was a Saturday afternoon, the house was silent. While I was on the couch, my mind was telling me something. As if it it knew something bad was going to happen. But I brushed the idea off and drifted off into sleep.\n\tTwo hours later… I jumped from my sleep and saw two men standing before me. They both were wearing all black and they were both prepared for whatever was to come. The man on my left, was running full force ahead of me. My immediate reaction was to kick him dead in the nuts, then pick up the vase that is sitting on the coffee table and knock it upside his head. Quickly enough, I took a piece of the broke vase and proceeded to stab him in the right eye with it. Slowly enough, took his eyeball out of his socket. That is when I noticed that the other guy disappeared. I only had a few seconds to get the baby and get up out of there.\n\tI sprinted up them stairs, ran into the baby’s bedroom. I grabbed his baby bag that is always prepared in case of emergency and the baby. Popped opened that window, stepped out onto the balcony and jumped.\nLuckily, we survived the jump and I was able to get up and run down the street. This run felt like eternity when in reality it was only two minutes that passed. One of my biggest regrets was looking back. Within a blink of an eye, a different man in all black tackled us onto the ground. The man on top of me and the baby had pinned us down to the ground. He turned around and signaled his men to come over. With that, I was able to raise my upper body up to see the baby. Although his eyes were closed he had this beautiful smile on him. \n“NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!” I quietly screamed out. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and laughed. I started to tear up because I really thought I lost him. Nevertheless, when something good happens there is always the worst to come. \nSo, the man that chased us brought to this old 1970 black camaro. On the car it that had a bright orange spray paint mark on the passenger side door, and the car had these fresh rims. When first upon entering into the car, there was this light skinned, bald headed man who seemed to be his in late forties on the driver side of the seat.

The stars in the dark sky were out shined by the lights and the sounds of nature were drowned by the cars and other city noises. \n\nLoud music bounced against the muted yellow colored walls and out of the windows that were opened to keep the apartment from getting too stuffy in the summer weather. The apartment was relatively clean; the only place that was the dirtiest was the kitchen as the inhabitants of the small apartment had been gone all day. The dishes overflowed in the sink and the counters were dirty from all the meals prepared on it. \n\nThe music came from the bathroom as the inhabitants living in the apartment were getting ready to go out into the night for some fun that they had not gotten the chance to have in quite a while. The lights over the large bathroom mirror reflected brightly off the orange walls as a girl with black hair too short to do much but put a decorative pin it put on mascara while Sana scrolled on her phone while sitting on the toilet.  \n\n“So, let me get this straight,” the girl with the short hair began looking at the blonde in disbelief making Sana roll her eyes and look up from her phone at her. “A guy comes into the ice cream shop, gives you a fat wad of cash and his number, and you’re not even going to text him?”\n\n“He was douche, there’s no way I’m trying to do anything with him or become his friend,” Sana replied shortly causing the girl to roll her eyes dramatically.   \n\n\nAnother woman with long black hair walked in the bathroom wearing a blue cocktail dress holding a curling iron. \n\n“Rachel, tell your friend that she’s being a weirdo,” the girl with the short black hair pleaded as Rachel plugged in the curling iron.   \n\n\n“What happened?” Rachel asked as she brushed her hair and looked to Sana.   \n\n\n“A douche gave me his number at work and she’s freaking out that I’m not going to text him,” she explained causing the black haired woman to giggle.  \n\n\n“Well, there’s no point in talking to someone you have no interest in,” she smiled as her younger sister, Devyn, groaned loudly.  \n\n\n“You both are weird,” she sighed taking the brush to begin brushing her hair and watched as her sister began to curl hers.   \n\n\n“I met someone weird today too,” Rachel said nonchalantly catching the attention of her two roommates who looked at each other questionably.  \n\n\n“Go on,” Sana pressed as she watched her friend bounce one of the curls in her hair in her hand before throwing it behind her shoulder.   \n\n\n“I got on the train after going to the store when I got off work and sat next to the guy. He was staring at me strangely before I bumped into him by accident and he pushed me away forcefully,” she explained while flipping another curl behind her shoulder.   \n\n\n“He must’ve had a bad day,” Sana suggested before she pursed her lips. “You guys are getting so dressed up, we’re just going to a bar.” Her clementine eyes looked at the blue cocktail dress and the floral romper her friends were wearing.  \n\n\n“You never know who you’re going to meet,” Rachel said as she unplugged the curling iron.   \n\n\n“You could meet your soulmate there,” Devyn smiled smugly at Sana who rolled her eyes and stood up.\n\n“You two and your soulmate stuff,” she grumbled as she left the bathroom to go into her room to change out of her work clothes.   \n\n\nHer room was the cleanest out of them all and over looked a busy street in the city. It was hard for her to sleep sometimes because of how close the building was to the street and how much light peered in through her window even with the curtains closed. She walked to her closet and stared inside of it at the clothes hanging up. At first she was planning on just wearing jeans and a nice dress shirt but now that her friends were dressing up she could not help but think she had to dress up as well.\n\nMaybe they were right about the soulmate thing, she thought as she grabbed a white off the shoulder sundress. She groaned at her thoughts as she put on the dress and a pair of heels and pushed them away as she brushed her hair. She did not feel like trying to make it fancy nor did she really have the time to along with putting on make up. When she looked in the mirror she was satisfied with how she looked and walked back to the bathroom in confidence. \n\nRachel and Devyn were giving themselves one last look over before they smiled at Sana, complimenting on how beautiful she looked.\n\n “You guys ready?”\n\n“Yep!” Rachel flipped her curls behind her shoulders and skipped out of the bathroom followed by her sister.   \n\n\nSana turned off all the lights in the apartment and followed her friends out on to the street with her purse. She walked beside them down the sidewalk yet she was quiet as they talked to each other, deep in thought. She could not stop thinking about what Devyn had said.\n\nCould she really meet her soulmate at the bar? Was that stuff even real? \n\nShe shook her head to get a hold of herself as a man catcalled her from the sidewalk across the street, bringing her back to reality. She ignored the man and looked to her friends who were stopped in front of a bar that they had never seen before.\n\nThe orange neon sign read, ‘Demie’s’ and looking inside the windows it was easy to tell that the place was a hot spot.\n\n“Let’s try it,” Rachel said as she grabbed the door handle and opened the door, walking in with her sister and Sana close behind.  \n\n\nThere was a bell above the door that rung loudly and heads turned to see the trio walk in to the bar. Most of them went quiet but the jukebox in the corner of the bar still played on as Sana was the only one who seemed to notice the stare of the other patrons. One particular patron made her blood boil as a chill went down her spine when their eyes met. \n\nShe gripped the leather strap of her purse and glared at the grinning red eyed man before following her friend’s lead who sat down at an empty booth. She made sure her back was towards the man even though she could still feel his stare as the other patrons went back to their drinking and eating. \n\nThey did not sit there long before a tall man walked up them who gave them all a shock while he smiled warmly down at them. \n\n“What can I get you three?”","title":"[FN] Soulmates?"},"questions":[{"question":"Why does Devyn think that the girls are weird?","answers":[{"answer":"They are not interested in a guy who gave them his number.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should be clearer about the context of the question.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is not related.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is not related to the question.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should be a complete sentence.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"While the answer is accurate, it doesn't answer the question.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should be clearer about the context of the story.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"It is omitted that Sana is not interested in the guy.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"She seems to be referring to Sana.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":true,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":{"text":"Sana is the one who is not interested in a guy who gave her his number.","category":"accuracy","severity":2,"category_text":""}},{"question":"Why are the girls dressing up?","answers":[{"answer":"It seems they are dressing up because they are going to a hot spot.","critiques":[{"critique":"It's omitted that they want to look nice for the men they might meet.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer could be clearer in its pronoun use.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that the girls are dressing up because they are going to a bar.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer is not specific enough.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The passage doesn't have any answers.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is not clear.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer could be more specific.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"It's not clear they're going to a hot spot.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[0,null,1,3,null,null,3,null],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"Why did one of the patrons make Sana's blood boil?","answers":[{"answer":"He was grinning at her.","critiques":[{"critique":"It is omitted that the man's behavior makes Sana believe that he has bad intentions.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that the man had red eyes.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer is too vague and needs to be more specific.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"It is omitted that the man had red eyes.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer is inaccurate.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,0,null,0,null],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null}]}}

The company built about 185 examples between 1981 and 1985, but it is now out of production.[4][5][6]\n\n\nDesign\n\nThe Endeavour 40 was intended for both the private owner's market and yacht charter operators and was intended to compete directly with boats built by Gulfstar Yachts, as both company principals, John Books and Rob Valdes has previously worked for Gulfstar.[7]\n\nThe Endeavour 40 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of polyester resin and fiberglass woven roving and multi-directional chopped strand fiber, with teak wood trim. It has a center cockpit, masthead sloop rig or optional ketch rig, with aluminum spars, a raked stem, a reverse transom, a skeg-mounted rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of structural lead ballast.[8][9][10][11]\n\nThe boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted.[12]\n\nThe boat is fitted with a British Perkins Engines 4-108 diesel engine of for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of .[13]\n\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for six people, with a double “V”-berth in the bow cabin, two straight settees in the main cabin and an aft cabin with a double berth. The main cabin features a folding dining table with two drop-leaves. The galley is located on the port side just aft of the companionway ladder. The galley is “L”-shaped and is equipped with a three-burner alcohol-fired stove and a double sink with hot and cold pressurized water and a fresh water pump, plus a refrigerator. A navigation station is opposite the galley, on the starboard side. There are two heads, one just aft of the bow cabin on the starboard side that includes a shower and one on the port side in the aft cabin. The engine room is located centrally, under the companionway ladder. The cabin is trimmed in teak.[14]\n\nVentilation is provided by 16 ports that open and four hatches.[15]\n\nFor sailing the mainsail has a mainsheet traveler at the aft of the center cockpit, two winches for the genoa sheets and one for the mainsheet, plus two winches for the main and genoa halyards. The boat is equipped with a topping lift and slab reefing.[16]\n\nThe design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 126.[17]\n\n\nOperational history\n\nIn a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote that the Endeavour 40 “is a big, comfortable cruiser intended for extended trips. Note that both fuel and water capacity are high. Ballast/displacement ratio is 36 percent. The cockpit, like most center cockpits, is high and therefore dry.”[18]\n\nSteve Knauth wrote a review for _Soundings Magazine_ in 2008 and stated, “the 1980s hull design features a modified fin keel with a skeg-protected rudder. The forefoot is slightly flatter than a traditional wineglass hull, and the 13-foot beam is carried well aft for form stability and interior volume. Sail area is 743 square feet, with a 338-square-foot main and 405-square-foot foretriangle. The center cockpit is farther aft than some designs, and it’s high and dry.”[19]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] Sherwood, Richard M.: _A Field Guide to Sailboats of North America, Second Edition_, pages 346-347.

He turned to the old man with delight and asked, “How much for this dog?”\n\tStartled the old man replied, “He’s not for sale.”\n\t“How about $1,000,” protested the tailored man?\n\t“No,” the old man yelled.\n\t“$10,000,” the tailored man rebuttal. \n\t“No,” the old man yelled infuriated.\n\tThe tailored man got down on his knees and begged, “Please I’ll give you a millionaire dollars this dog.”\n\t“Why do you want this dog so bad,” the old man asked?\n\t‘You see when I was a boy I had a dog named Maverick, who was a black lab. He looked exactly like that dog over there. One day my mother got sick of him and decided to let him go in the woods. I cried for weeks because I lost the only person who understood me. And now here I am looking at a clone of him. So please Sir, I’m begging sell me your dog.”\n\tThe Old man contemplated whether or not to give up the dog. It was a symbol for everything he once had, but with the money he could get it all back.  Thoroughly thought through he decided to sell the dog. The tailored man’s faced lighted up like a virgin who was about to lose his virginity to a cheerleader. He signed a check, handed it over to the old man and left feeling whole again. As for the old man he started over again.\n\tCleaned up and fresh out of rehab he invested his money into nanotechnology, which turned him into a Billionaire. He lived in 10-acre mansion with a 3-acre yard, Olympic sized ground pool and Jacuzzi. He had a trophy wife with a bust of a goddess, and trophy cars to match. This old man had it all, except the dog. The only true serenity he had in his life. Now he’s the tailored man. The empty tailored man.\n\n\n \n","title":"False Smile"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story say about life in rehab?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"No answer","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The story doesn't say anything about life in rehab.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"Rehab is not discussed, but it is implied the now-Billionaire-man started over again.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is empty.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"This response is not related.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that the old man gets clean and fresh out of rehab.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What does the story say about the old homeless man?","answers":[{"answer":"He was a heroin addict who lived on the corner of 5th and 1st.

Shanahan denied the allegations. \"Though my marriage ended in sorrow and disappointment, I never laid a hand on my then-wife and cooperated fully in a thorough law enforcement investigation that resulted in her being charged with assault against me—charges which I had dropped in the interest of my family,” Shanahantold USA Today.\n\nThe Washington Postalso published a story Tuesday detailing other domestic violence incidents involving Shanahan's family, including how his son was arrested in 2011 after allegedly beating his mother with a baseball bat. The Post said Shanahan defended his son, saying at the time he acted in self-defense. Shanahan told the paper this week that resurfacing the incident “will ruin my son’s life,” while backing away from his original self-defense claim.\n\nWithout referencing the reporting, Trump announced on Twitter earlier Tuesday the acting secretary will not go forward with confirmation in order to focus on his family.\n\n“Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who has done a wonderful job, has decided not to go forward with his confirmation process so that he can devote more time to his family,” the president tweeted. “I thank Pat for his outstanding service and will be naming Secretary of the Army, Mark Esper, to be the new Acting Secretary of Defense. I know Mark, and have no doubt he will do a fantastic job!”\n\nEsper has served as secretary of the United States Army since 2017. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1986 — the same year as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nLast month, the White House announced Trump's intention to have Shanahan permanently lead the department, following his time serving as acting secretary. At the time, Shanahan said he was \"honored\" by Trump's decision.\n\n“If confirmed by the Senate, I will continue the aggressive implementation of our National Defense Strategy,\" he said. \"I remain committed to modernizing the force so our remarkable Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines have everything they need to keep our military lethal and our country safe.”\n\n[In this April 2, 2019, file photo, Secretary of the Army Mark Esper speaks during a House Armed Services Committee budget hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Fox News was told the panel was still waiting for paperwork from the FBI’s background check.\n\nShanahan worked at Boeing for over 30 years before coming to the Pentagon as then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’s deputy at the start of the Trump administration. He has filled the role of acting defense secretary since Mattis' resignation last year.\n\n_Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson and Elizabeth Zwirz contributed to this report._\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about Trump's opinions on both candidates to lead the Pentagon?","answers":[{"answer":"Trump said it's a difficult time for Shanahan.

For one, 2017 turned out to be a much better year for the global economy than had been anticipated.\n\nGlobal growth was a healthy 3.5% and well distributed across the world. Stock markets were on a tear, including here in India, clocking returns not seen since the halcyon pre-financial crisis days. While there has been a lot of talk about ‘economic nationalism’, nothing fundamentally changed in the global order.\n\nThe conversation at Davos is likely to be more optimistic than it has been in the last few years. This year’s theme is ‘Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World’.\n\nThe first subagenda, the ‘Global Agenda’, seeks to support efforts to improve global governance mechanisms and advance major multilateral processes, such as the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. The ‘Geopolitical Agenda’ seeks to improve the adaptation to change by global leaders. The ‘Economic Agenda’ will focus on supporting sustainable and inclusive economic development, while the ‘Regional Agenda’ will examine the social and economic transformations occurring across the world.\n\nIn the ‘Industry and Business Agenda’, participants will contribute to the shaping of new industry ecosystems and help industry and government leaders prepare for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Finally, in the ‘Future Agenda’, attendees will share ideas, innovations and discoveries that will have a global impact.\n\nAbout 3,000 business leaders, 350 high-ranking officials, including 60 Heads of State and Government, will participate in the four-day forum. The presence of US President Donald Trump has created unprecedented media attention. There will also be French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nFor India, this year will be even more important due to the participation of the Indian PM after 20 years. For Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there are two clear agenda points. The first is to continue to aggressively promote India as an investment destination. We need much more investment, and what better forum than Davos with its high concentration of global CEOs, investors and influencers to make a pitch.\n\nThe ‘Make in India’ campaign needs to be re-energised for better results. There is much for the PM to tout as far as his economic track record is concerned, not least of which is the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the sound macro fundamentals, the resolution of non-performing assets (NPAs), the structural reforms of specific sectors, and the positive outlook for faster growth. India continues to be the fastest growing large economy in the world with increasing consumer demand.\n\nThe PM will need to nudge foreign investors further in that direction. At Davos, he has to be India’s marketing chief. The second agenda for Modi will be to lay out India’s position in this ever-changing world, and his personal views as the prime representative of a sixth of humanity. Are we willing to shelve the shibboleths of the past – India’s ‘socialist’ orientation, the vestiges of our ‘non-alignment’, our aloofness from global trade and investment, and our ‘difficulties’ in doing business -- and boldly take the lead, especially as the US vacates leadership space and China rushes in to fill the vacuum?\n\nIn such a context, the world will be comparing and contrasting the positions of Xi Jinping from last year’s forum -- where the Chinese premier appeared willing to take on leadership for an open global order and made quite a splash in doing so -- with the vision that Modi will present.\n\nThe PM is likely to use the Davos platform to state India’s views on this emerging new world order. India has also taken a strong domestic position on climate change. But combating climate change needs constant leadership and the world needs to be shepherded along in that direction. India can take the lead in this area and Modi can put his weight behind it. So this year, Davos will move the global agenda forward.\n\n_THE WRITER IS CHAIRMAN-CEO, RENEW POWER AND WILL BE AT DAVOS 2018_\n\n(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

He’s very quiet I haven’t really seen him give anyone orders at all either. Whenever something needs to be done I see him doing it. He doesn’t just sit around; I’ve actually seen him go into the mines. I don’t know if it’s just because I’m a child but not even the adults in the village are as active as him.\t\n\n       He’s always leaving the kingdom and coming back with tons of different things. I can’t always see what he’s coming back with, but I’ve seen bones, some kind of meat that just looks bad, and even strange looking pearls. And the dogs! He has so many dogs that there’s not a single wild dog here. He must be traveling great distances to find all these dogs, because I know they’re not from here. \n\n\tWhen I see him doing all these strange things I start asking my parents what it is he’s doing, and they tell me: “don’t question the king,” but they never tell me why. He doesn’t look old, so he can’t be all that wise. All that work he does and all the times he leaves - it’s not normal.  I was  sick of wondering.\n\n\tI finally got into his castle and he was at his workbench. When I got closer he looked back at me, seemingly confused, but he turned back around and kept tinkering with some weird red dust. I got closer and mustered up the courage to ask him as politely as I could, “How come you’re so different than everyone else?” The king stopped, stood up and looked at me. He asked, “Excuse me?” and I said it again. He chuckled briefly under his breath and said “it seems like you’re different too.”\n\t\n       He started to tell me a story. “When I was your age, I lived in a different kingdom and I felt the same way about my king. I would go to school and all the kids and the teachers would seem to just drift through their lives, but not the king; he was always spontaneous. I was finally sick of that curious feeling, so I went and talked to my king and he told me his story. Sometime afterwards the kingdom was destroyed and all the people inside were attacked by monsters. It was terrible. There were explosions, arrows, and the groans of the undead. \n\n\tI was able to escape, but barely. I fought my way out with nothing but my hands. finally I found a break in the chaos and I found a cave and covered the entrance with dirt. I was devastated, but I wanted to live so I built a shelter.  I enjoyed building. Then since I had built my shelter I began mining - I enjoyed that as well. I had so many supplies I decided to build more and I ended up building a village. Strangely enough people appeared. That village moved on to become this kingdom. That’s my story.”\n\n\tI asked him why he told me all that. and he told me simply because I was a player. A player? I was so confused. He then told me that only players are kings. I didn’t understand. He went on by asking me what my earliest memory is and I told him standing outside. “Exactly,” He said. “That was the first time you entered this world.” He started talking about how this life isn’t real and that once he’s gone he’ll be able to enter the real world again.\n\n\tHe began taking me adventuring with him, that’s when he would explain things and share his knowledge with me. “When a king dies, everything he ever did goes with him. That’s how my king’s old kingdom was destroyed. I left my Kingdom and made a village. I have people of my own now. My king was killed by a mob of three suicide creatures right outside his gate. I saw everything he had made disappear along with him.” That’s when I believed everything he told me - while he took me adventuring with him. Now I know that there is a better life to be had out of this one. A less edged and more rounded one. Thank you king Steve.

That has uprooted tenants and made home ownership unattainable for most.\n\n[]\n\nIn this Saturday, July 6, 2019 photo, women walk on the shore of the Persian Gulf Martyrs’ Lake in Tehran, Iran (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)\n\nThe Alidadis sold their car and borrowed from friends and family to buy a smaller apartment in a less desirable area on the outskirts of Tehran — in hindsight a smart move, since they’ve been priced out of their old neighborhood by now.\n\n“Right now, this is the most difficult period ever,” said Alidadi’s 58-year-old mother, Shahla Allahverdi, reflecting on the Islamic Republic’s 40-year history as she shared a park bench with her daughter.\n\nIranians worry about the future as tensions between Iran and the West continue to rise.\n\nThe escalation — triggered by the Trump administration’s withdrawal last year from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers — seems unstoppable, and European mediators trying to defuse the situation keep coming up short.\n\nThe showdown between Washington and Tehran has upended the lives of Iranians as they try to survive on less. A bride borrowed a wedding dress because she couldn’t afford to buy or even rent one. More newlyweds move in with their families to save money. Visa requests are up at foreign embassies, with young Iranians eager to leave.\n\n[]\n\nIn this July 3, 2019 photo, a worker adjusts a display of wedding dresses in downtown Tehran, Iran (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)\n\nSome wonder how far Washington is willing to push its “maximum pressure” campaign.\n\nThe Trump administration says the sanctions are aimed at getting Iran to renegotiate the nuclear deal, which offered sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nWashington denies its ultimate aim is to end the rule of Shiite Muslim clerics — though John Bolton, an architect of the pressure campaign, called for regime change before he became Trump’s national security adviser.\n\nSome say Washington’s actions appear to have strengthened the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and other hard-liners at the expense of President Hassan Rouhani, once the nuclear deal’s most prominent champion.\n\nThe Guard has been able to deepen its role in the economy, domestic politics and foreign policy under the guise of security, said Ellie Geranmayeh, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nDespite the economic upheaval, there have only been sporadic protests.\n\n[]\n\nA group of protesters chant slogans at the main gate of old grand bazaar in Tehran, Iran, Monday, June 25, 2018. Protesters in the Iranian capital swarmed its historic Grand Bazaar on Monday, news agencies reported, and forced shopkeepers to close their stalls in apparent anger over the Islamic Republic’s troubled economy, months after similar demonstrations rocked the country. (Iranian Labor News Agency via AP)\n\nIran analyst Adnan Tabatabai said he believes Iranians are “reluctant to take their grievances to the street” for now, amid fear of further chaos and pushback by the authorities.\n\nThe economy contracted by 4.9% from March 2018 to March 2019. It is expected to shrink by an additional 5.5% in the year ending March 2020, according to Iranian figures. The official inflation rate has risen to 35%, up from 23.8% in the March 2018 to March 2019 period.\n\nThe housing and construction sector, which makes up about one-quarter of the economy and is the top destination for savings and investments, has been thrown out of balance.\n\nProperty owners are reluctant to sell and landlords are sharply raising rents because of the currency collapse, said Ali Dadpay, a finance professor at the University of Dallas. He said an estimated 490,000 homes stand empty in and around the capital, including more than 40,000 units added this year.\n\nAt the same time, construction lags far behind the need of 1.2 million new homes a year nationwide, said Hesam Oghabaei, deputy head of the Tehran association of real estate agents. He said about 25% of Tehran’s residents live in rented apartments, and the vast majority cannot afford the price increases.\n\nThe Peyman family — elderly parents and eight adult children — own a 110 square meter (1,180 square feet) apartment in Tehran’s District 12, a poor area plagued by drug addiction and other social problems. More than a decade ago, the Peymans rented the apartment, and used the extra income to move to a nicer area.\n\nNow they are back in District 12, renovating the old apartment after being squeezed out of the good neighborhood by a rent hike.\n\n[]\n\nIn this July 6, 2019 photo, a woman walks in District 12, a poor area plagued by drug addiction and other social problems, in Tehran, Iran (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)\n\n“We have to come here because we have no other choice,” said the patriarch, Moslem, 65. Four unmarried children will live with him and his wife. Across-the-board price increases put marriage out of reach.\n\nOne of Tehran’s newest areas, District 22, is under construction on the northwestern edge of the city. It consists of apartment high-rises and shopping malls arranged around an artificial lake called Chitgar.\n\nMaryam Alidadi and her husband bought an 82-square-meter (880 square feet) apartment here in December, downsizing by a third from their rented home in a more affluent area.\n\n“Our standard of living has dropped considerably,” she said, adding that she now regrets having quit her government job four years ago when her son Rami was born.\n\n[]\n\nThis July 6, 2019 photo shows residential towers in District 22, that consists of apartment high-rises and shopping malls arranged around an artificial lake called Chitgar, under construction on the northwestern edge of Tehran, Iran (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)\n\nThe US sanctions have proven particularly devastating for Iran’s large middle class, said Dadpay, the finance professor. “This is the economic class that depends on the global economy, depends on their skillsets, and most of them are earning fixed incomes,” he said.\n\nThe economic freefall could shape Iran’s domestic politics, with parliament elections in February posing the first test. Middle class voters have traditionally favored reformist candidates but might sit out voting because of a lack of alternatives, inadvertently boosting hard-liners.\n\nPro-reform politicians who favor a greater opening to the West are closely linked to the nuclear deal.\n\nWith the deal faltering, the hard-liners, including the Revolutionary Guard, are becoming more entrenched, said Geranmayeh, the analyst.\n\nThe Guard, she said, “is going to be a force to be reckoned with for many years to come.”\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize Maryam Alidadi's family's  financial situation.","answers":[{"answer":"Maryam Alidadi used to lead a comfortable middle-class life.

Not only were they, but in some cases these observers disturbed the count; others can be seen watching counters on livestreams.\n\nThe president’s words aren’t surprising, as he’d suggested ahead of the election that he would not accept its results. And, true to form, he has not.\n\nIn many ways, the official statement is a more formal version of the baseless allegations of voter fraud the president made in a series of tweets Saturday morning, in which he appeared to desperately grasp at any whimsical conspiracy theory necessary to keep power.\n\nIn those tweets, Trump lied about votes being “illegally received” in Pennsylvania “and certain other states.” Despite the fact, of course, that all states have counted only ballots submitted according to their guidelines. Some states, like Pennsylvania, allowed mail-in ballots received after Election Day — but with a postmark from Election Day, or earlier — to be counted. There’s nothing illegal about this, however; in fact, states are legally obligated to count ballots that are submitted in accordance with election law.\n\nTrump also lied on Twitter about election observers not being allowed in counting rooms in “numerous states.” As noted above, this is false.\n\nThe tweets were flagged by Twitter as “disputed” and potentially “misleading.”\n\n  ....This would ALSO change the Election result in numerous States, including Pennsylvania, which everyone thought was easily won on Election Night, only to see a massive lead disappear, without anyone being allowed to OBSERVE, for long intervals of time, what the happened...\n\n  — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2020\n\n  ....Bad things took place during those hours where LEGAL TRANSPARENCY was viciously & crudely not allowed. Tractors blocked doors & windows were covered with thick cardboard so that observers could not see into the count rooms. BAD THINGS HAPPENED INSIDE. BIG CHANGES TOOK PLACE!\n\n  — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2020\n\nOverall, there is no evidence of voter fraud or tampering with vote counting. As Vox’s Aaron Rupar explained, the Trump campaign is making wild allegations of impropriety now and hoping to find evidence for them later:\n\n  Their strategy is to make allegations first and HOPEFULLY FIND EVIDENCE FOR THEM LATER. This state of affairs was thrown into stark relief late Friday morning during a Fox News interview with RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel. During it, Fox News hosts appeared to be out of patience with her evidence-free insinuations that the election was somehow stolen from Trump.\n\n  “We just haven’t seen it. It hasn’t been presented. There’s all kinds of stuff flying on the internet, but when we look into it, it doesn’t pan out,” anchor Bret Baier told McDaniel, as she failed to explain how her technical gripes about election observers in Michigan could possibly affect the result in a state Biden appears poised to win by well over 100,000 votes.\n\nTrump took these falsehoods to a new level Saturday, concluding his morning tweets with a incorrect statement that he actually won the election, writing “I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!”\n\n  I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!\n\n  — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2020\n\nIt’s concerning that the president of the United States is just outright lying about an election he lost, and that he has refused to concede now that it is clear he has lost. Perhaps even worse is that several high level Republican lawmakers have joined in on spreading doubt about the accuracy of the election results. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), along with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, all appeared on Fox News to repeat the false assertion that Trump won the election.\n\nWhat lawsuits come Monday remain to be seen. But it is clear that Trump expects the courts to save him. However, as Vox’s Ian Millhiser has explained, that’s not a strategy that is likely to bear fruit. And whether he concedes or not, Biden will be sworn in as the next president of the United States in January.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWILL YOU HELP KEEP VOX FREE FOR ALL?\n\nThere is tremendous power in understanding.

Walking past the infamous cherry booths, that look like they came straight out of a speakeasy from a William S. Burroughs novel, crimson velvet curtain and all. I suddenly see several men walking in and out of one booth. My curiosity at this point is peeked. I can't resist. I stick my head in. I see so many naked men on one women fucking a hole out  the back of her head. \n\nSo many hands. \nSo many cocks. \nOne woman. \nShe's loving it. \n\n\"She's a squirter\" one of them yells as he cums in unison. \n\nThey notice me.

I live for that feeling, when it washes over you like wave after crushing wave smashing into the the sandy beach with the force of two trucks colliding on the interstate. Therapeutic, calming, soothing. Blow is a pure kick, a feeling that lifts you straight up, like an elevator in a high rise, and starts leaving you as soon as you feel it. \n\nWalking through the sea of people, I feel like a flounder swimming amongst it's school. Standing in front of me the most beautiful goddess I've ever seen dancing with the stylized gestures of a Mayan temple goddess. There was something archaic in her movements, an animalistic grace, beautiful and repulsive all at once. I'm immediately transported back to a time centuries ago. I could picture her like a gypsy girl dancing around the light of a campfire. I can hear the sounds of off beat clapping accompanied by the sounds of ancient instruments long forgotten. I can see her ambiguous gestures fading in and out of the light. The touch of her hand around my neck snaps me back to reality. She pulls me in close with the force of a WWII era woman clutching her husband whose returned from war in the old world, never letting go. It's amazing how you can feel alone with someone In room crammed with people. I always thought how strange it is that societies expectations of the times youth need to go to loud places to find people they can be quiet with. \n\nAll my different voices are hitting me now all at once. Uppers, downers, ketamine, cocaine, alcohol. You name it I'm on it. It feels like there is a force greater than gravity weighing me down on this spot. I get lost in the flickering of the strobe lights above us glistening of e beaded up sweat on her body. I'm hypnotized. Like a draconian figure from a Bram Stoker,s film I'm drawn to her neck. Our bodies move synchronized to the tantric rhythms the DJ is spinning. \nI make my move.\nI kiss her neck.   \nThe sweat of her neck quenches my thirst. It was like I could tap into a source like I was turning on a faucet. I was the artist and she was my vessel. She filled my flask, I drank from it. I delved, devoured her. Unmistakably drowning in her knowledge  of magic, of good, of evil. I asked my self, \"have I had my fill?\" \n\nI kiss her lips.\nOur tongues dancing like champion tango dancers, strangers in the night. Is it love? Or is it lust?  She slips a pill of mdma in my mouth with her tongue. \n\n I'm not asking for forever, just for tonight. \n\nShe stares deep into my eyes with her pupils as big and black, with a mosquito's unseeing calm. \n\n\"Let's go back to my place.\"\n","title":"[NF] strangers in the night"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize all the sexual activities going on in the story.","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator and his friends are doing cocaine in the bathroom.

Leto's death saw the eventual breakdown of his empire, severe famine on many worlds, and the introduction of Ixian no-ships. It was all part of The Golden Path, as put forward by Leto, which was triggered by a perceived need to diversify the human race and allow it to evolve.\n\n\nContents\n\n-   1 Origin\n-   2 Scattering Space\n-   3 Return from the Scattering\n-   4 Behind the Scenes\n-   5 Appearances\n\n\nOrigin[edit | edit source]\n\nLeto II's prescience allowed him to see into both the past and the future, and he believed that ten thousand years of rule by the Faufreluches had allowed the human race to become stagnant, and that drastic action on Leto's part was needed in order for the human race to survive.\n\nLeto II was also aware that a likelihood existed that the Thinking Machines, before they were destroyed in the Butlerian Jihad, had scattered. A stagnant human race would have little chance should the machines return. The entire purpose of \"Leto's Golden path\" was to force the human race to abandon certainty, security, and safety as individual goals and to \"scatter\" not only geographically, but also to do so technologically, ideologically, and socio-politically.\n\nAs a result of this philosophy, during the reign of Leto II humanity was predominantly planet bound and ruled by an iron fist for more than 3500 years. This was in contrast to the relative freedom of expression and movement people enjoyed to a limited degree under the Faufreluches, the limits being predominantly the inherent control of feudal rule and the Spacing Guild monopoly on space travel. Indeed, Leto II exerted a level of control that was unprecedented in the Imperium, including power over the Guild and space travel, a feat that previous Emperors had been unable to accomplish. Upon Leto's death, the stalwart and long-established order of the Imperium disintegrated, as did control over freedoms and movement, and as a result, humanity rediscovered independence and nobilities on an unprecedented scale. This paved the way for humanity to \"scatter\" across the universe into the unknown and further evolution of the human race.\n\nAccording to Leto II's plan, his death was followed by a collapse of political control and Spice supplies - as it would take generations for the Spice cycle to reassert itself on Rakis. Political order collapsed and entire worlds starved to death, in a chaotic period known as the Famine Times. The Scattering was an immediate response to the Famine Times, as refugees fled the anarchy consuming the Old Imperium.\n\n\nScattering Space[edit | edit source]\n\nDuring The Scattering, many people remained within the boundaries of the Old Imperium. Many, however, did not. Countless humans departed the Old Imperium for uncharted space, never to return. For 1,500 years, humanity explored the uncharted realms of the universe beyond the boundaries of the Old Imperium. New groups and cultures evolved.\n\nDuring the Scattering, vast waves of refugees spread outwards into uncharted space, so that the number of human-colonized worlds exponentially ballooned both in number and spread. The Bene Gesserit who remained in the territories of the Old Imperium could only make vague guesses at the size of \"Scattering space\", as it was theoretically infinite and even the Honored Matres might not know its full extent. One clue is that the Lost Ones returning from the Scattering refer to the Old Imperium as \"the million worlds\" or \"the million planets\" - implying that Scattering space is at least several multiples larger than that.\n\nLittle is also known of the exact socio-political history of what happened in Scattering space, other than that its development across 1,500 years was fairly rapid - a direct reaction to the enforced sedentary nature of Leto's Pace for 3,500 years, or the 10,000 year static structure of the Faufreluches under the Corrino empire.\n\nWhat is known is that eventually, the Honored Matres developed as a fusion of Bene Gesserit and Fish Speakers (and possibly other groups) who had fled into the Scattering. An aggressive group focused on conquest and domination, the Honored Matres carved out vast swaths of territory among the worlds settled in the Scattering. One of these worlds, or perhaps a collection of worlds, was referred to as \"Dur\".\n\nAnother group that rose to prominence in Scattering space were the Lost Tleilaxu - no longer bound by even the pretense of following the restrictions of the Great Convention, they pushed genetic manipulation drastically farther than their Bene Tleilax forbearers in the Old Imperium ever did. Among other creations, the Lost Tleilaxu brazenly spliced together human and animal stock, creating the feline-based Futars and fish-based Phibians. The Honored Matres came into conflict with the Lost Tleilaxu, becoming their bitter enemies, in wars that spread across much of Scattering space. During this time the Tleilaxu refined the Futars, creating them for the express purpose of hunting Honored Matres. Nonetheless, the Matres managed to capture and enslaves many Futars and Phibians.\n\n\nReturn from the Scattering[edit | edit source]\n\nAbout 1,500 years after the death of God-Emperor Leto II, many of the Lost Ones began to return from the Scattering to the space of the Old Imperium. Chief among these were the Honored Matres, who carved a path of conquest whether they went, and exterminated the Bene Tleilax and Bene Gesserit wherever they found them.\n\nThe Bene Gesserit eventually learned that the cause of this return was that the Honored Matres were fleeing an even more powerful adversary they encountered out in the Scattering, which the Honored Matres only briefly alluded to as \"The Enemy\" or \"the Enemies of Many Faces\". The Matres had managed to steal some of the powerful Obliterator weapons from this Enemy before being easily overwhelmed. While the Honored Matres were fixated on destroying the Bene Gesserit, they were also determined to learn their methods of cellular control over their own metabolism which granted them immunity to disease and poisons - a skill that had atrophied among the Matres themselves when they split off from the Bene Gesserit. From this the Bene Gesserit also deduced that the Enemy the Matres were fleeing had made extensive use of biological warfare, against which the Matres no longer had adequate defenses.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes[edit | edit source]\n\nWithin the context of Frank Herbert's original novels, the Scattering occurs between the novels God Emperor of Dune and Heretics of Dune.\n\n\nAppearances[edit | edit source]\n\n-   _God Emperor of Dune_ (First mentioned)\n-   _Heretics of Dune_ (Mentioned only)\n-   _Chapterhouse: Dune_ (Mentioned only)\n\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the origins of the Scattering.","answers":[{"answer":"Leto II, the God-Emperor, saw into both the past and the future.

Anything about taking out or adding things or whatever thoughts come your way would be helpful!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI Have A Friend\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I have this friend. For some reason I feel sad before I even start to talk about her. She went to a Christian school growing up and made sure everyone knew it was her grandparents that sent her here, not her parents. She mentioned that she grew up with the Christian religion bashed into her by her grandparents and I’m pretty sure at this point she looked sick of it. Her Mom wasn’t as religious, so at least she got away from it occasionally. This girl just didn’t fit in with anyone at her little Christian Academy. This friend and I always thought Christians could sense someone who didn’t belong.\n\nYou could tell she didn’t know who she was by the way she flip-flopped between the shy, quiet kids and the loud popular kids. I don’t think she ever stuck with one group. It was a small school with even smaller classes, so it was hard not to notice everything about everyone. The teachers didn’t seem to care about her one way or another and the other kids were always a little bit more interested in someone else. She always seemed to be the second or third choice.\n\nMy friend did at one point find another friend named Audrey who she absolutely clicked with and we all became best friends, girl power and all that blah blah blah. Audrey brought out our crazy sides, gave us a reason to get up every day and was just someone to share things with. Neither of us had ever had a friend like her. We were jealous of Audrey a little bit but not enough to hate her, just enough to admire her. Our new best friend Audrey played the guitar, had a great family that loved their kids and all their kids’ friends as well. We were accepted in her house.\n\nAudrey was a year older than us and went to high school first. We stayed best friends, but Audrey was finding new friends of her own. We got jealous but knew we were still her best friend. We were still in youth group together and making a lot of new friends. All was going well until we had to go to a different high school than Audrey. We drifted apart. All of us did after that.\n\nI saw my friend go from this radiant, funny girl who had a sense of belonging back to her old self. I feel like she looked like she did when I first started to recognize her in middle school. Just a shell with nowhere to turn and not a clue where to start. So, this friend of mine seemed to be worse than when she started, in an even bigger pool of people but not knowing any of them.\n\nAll these new people my friend met were very different and clearly light years ahead of her. It was sadly clear that what my friend did to fit in was a drastic move on her part. We fell even further apart. It tore me apart to watch her start doing whatever everyone else did and say just to lose all hope of having her own personality. I saw this personality form in her when we were with Audrey but now its like the personality she developed drained away completely. She became a master of adapting to all the new situations that got thrown her way.\n\nI barely knew her now. It was sad to see her everyday and not be able to do anything about it. Sometimes I would shout at her to get her attention but usually she’d brush me off and shove me away. I saw her throw her whole self into anyone who showed her some sort of attention or what she thought was love. This made it even harder when those people would continuously let her down, but she would move on and do it again.\n\nIt was like she was a detective interrogating all these different people for the answers, but they just weren’t giving her any. She was searching and searching with no results. I don’t think she knew she was looking for something, but I could clearly see it and looking back its clear that she was desperate. Neither of us really knew what she wanted or needed but I just wanted her to let me help. I could only be so persistent when she just continued to push me away.\n\nI could go on and on about how this friend of mine continued to search for answers throughout high school, but it would be a never-ending story and to tell the truth it very well could still be happening today. I saw something happen to her though.\n\nI was watching when it happened. She was with a boy she had met not long ago, and it was obvious she was infatuated with him; would do anything he said no matter what. He told her about something he had been doing behind her back and she looked pissed. But I know her better than anyone and I could tell she wasn’t mad about what he had been doing but that he had been doing it without her. Yet again she threw herself into everything whole-heartedly and if this was a part of this boy she thought she loved then she wanted in.\n\nI can’t believe it happened. Well, I can’t believe that either of these things really went down. Before it all happened and before he gave her that shot in the arm that would take her away from me for a very long time she looked in the mirror. For the first time in years I looked back at her through that same mirror, she really saw me, and I really saw her. That connection happened, and we knew what we were doing. We knew what path we were taking. She seemed to be saying good bye for now but not forever. There was an awareness that she was making the decision to leave me behind. I don’t think she knew before she was leaving me, but now she was actively doing it.\n\nI got to see myself clearly that day and through the rough years I occasionally got to look through the mirror when she let me, and we even had a few screaming matches. In the present I now know I made that choice for a reason and I knew it would be a very long time until I’d see myself again. But It did happen. Although my relationship with my friend is different now than when we were young, at least I get to see her every day.","title":"[MF] Short Story on addiction(help!)"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the feelings the narrator has toward her friend.

Speaking after Dele Alli was booked for simulation in the 2-2 draw against Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday - his third such offence in as many seasons - Pochettino voiced his belief that the general mood of moral panic within the game, over what he described as “minimal details”, risks stifling football’s natural expression.\n\nPochettino also reserved harsh judgement for the use of video technology, saying that human refereeing errors were an intrinsic part of the game. Likewise, he argued that simulation on the pitch, while an offence rightly punishable under the laws of the game, was simply a sporting tactic rather than anything more sinister, insisting: “Football is about trying to trick your opponent.”\n\nThe Tottenham manager has admitted in the past that during his playing days at Newell’s Old Boys and Estudiantes, diving to win a penalty from the referee was regarded as a skill, one even practised in training. And Pochettino’s distaste for English moralising is underpinned by the fact that it was his leg over which Michael Owen dived during the 2002 World Cup, ultimately sending England through to the knockout stages at Argentina’s expense.\n\nDoubtless Pochettino will be accused in some quarters of giving divers a free pass. Yet equally, he deserves a good deal of credit for trying to convey a nuanced, intelligent sentiment in a language that is not his first. He agreed that Alli’s dive merited a booking, although he denied that Alli was beginning to develop a bad reputation amongst referees. But it was the froth and furore that followed which he found most baffling.\n\n“Look, it was a yellow card,” he said. “It happens. The referee was right. During different games, a lot of situations like this happen. The problem now is that we are so sensitive about the situation, and then we are so focused on Dele Alli. It’s too much sometimes. There is such a focus on this type of situation. I think it’s a minimal issue.\n\n“Look, there are a lot of positives from Dele. Of course, he's not perfect. Nobody is perfect. Of course, he is a clever boy. He is a little bit nasty. The problem is that, more than this type of situation, I am worried we are going to change the game that we know.”\n\nMauricio Pochettino has stressed that commentators shouldn't be overly fixated on Dele Alli's diving antics \n\n(Getty)\n\nWhereupon the discussion abruptly opened out into broader themes: into the media, into English exceptionalism, into the very essence of the game. “Football is a creative sport,” he said, “in which you need the talent that grows in a very intelligent person, a very smart brain. And now we are so focused on minimal details. I am worried that in a few years, we are pushing the sport we love now - a passionate sport that people love to watch around the world - into a very rigid structure. With VAR, with focusing too much on small actions like this.\n\nIndependent Football Newsletter\n\nGet the latest football headlines direct to your inbox twice a week\n\nIndependent Football Newsletter\n\nGet the latest football headlines direct to your inbox twice a week\n\nThe Independent would like to keep you informed about offers, events and updates by email, please tick the box if you would like to be contacted\n\nRead our full mailing list consent terms here\n\n“Football is about trying to trick your opponent - yes or no? Tactics – what does ‘tactic’ mean? When you do tactics, it is to try to trick the opponent. You play on the right, but you finish on the left. Twenty years ago, thirty years ago, we all congratulated a player when he tricks the referee like this. That is the football that I was in love with when I was a child. Yes, in Argentina, but in England too. You believe that in England you were honest and always perfect?”\n\nFinally, Pochettino argued that referees should simply be allowed to officiate and make errors unmolested by instant judgement and granular video analysis. “I am worried that maybe we are going to kill the game,” he said. “We love this game. Referees are humans too, and sometimes they are right, sometimes they are not right. In 10 months, over the whole season, sometimes it is against you, sometimes it is for you. For me, I like this type of football.\n\nThe Tottenham boss is concerned the game is being scrutinised to the point of death\n\n(Getty)\n\n“My worry is this: of course if you dive, and the referee saw you, you are punished. And he deserves it. But don’t go more crazy.”\n\nAfter a turbulent few days, Alli will probably be grateful for a night away from the spotlight, as he is set to be rested for Tottenham’s FA Cup fourth-round replay against Newport County at Wembley on Wednesday night. Pochettino said he would make several changes, with crunch games against Arsenal and Juventus coming up in the next week. Toby Alderweireld and Danny Rose could both return from injury, while Harry Winks, Fernando Llorente, Juan Foyth and Serge Aurier are all in contention for a start.\n\nNaturally, Tottenham will remain heavy favourites against their League Two opposition, who will be bringing almost 8,000 fans to Wembley from South Wales. With Newport receiving 45 per cent of gate receipts, plus television revenue, this season’s cup run could end up earning the club around £700,000 - a third of their annual budget.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize what the text says about diving/dives.

First active in the automobile industry of greater Detroit, Michigan, MESA was founded in 1933 and was “the first union to effectively establish itself in what had been a traditionally open shop strong, Detroit's mass production automobile industry.”[1] MESA's general secretary was English immigrant Matthew Smith.\n\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Mechanics Educational Society of America was founded by disgruntled members of the International Association of Machinists as an educational society. However, radical transplants from the United Kingdom like Smith, Frank McCracken, and John Anderson recognized the potential of the group and pushed for a full-fledged union. In June 1933, the U.S. Congress passed the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 which protected the collective bargaining rights of unions. A month later, MESA began an organizing drive in Detroit, Pontiac, Michigan, and Flint, Michigan which increased membership to approximately 5,000.[2]\n\n\nLeading members\n\nLongtime national secretary Matthew Smith, who had been active in the Amalgamated Engineering Union in England, refused to obtain U.S. citizenship, telling a U.S. Congress subcommittee: “I'm an internationalist, a citizen of the human race.”[3] Another prominent leader was Trotskyist Bert Cochran, who was a district organizer for MESA during the 1930s and 1940s.[4] However, Cochran led several MESA locals out of MESA and into the UAW.[5]\n\n\nMembership and Locals\n\nMembership in 1944 was approximately 42,000.[6] By 1935, the union had expanded out of Detroit into other cities with a significant amount of industrial workers, including Rome, New York,[7] Flint, Michigan, Toledo, Ohio, Cleveland, Ohio[8], Defiance, Ohio and the Connecticut cities of Torrington, New Haven, and Bridgeport.[9]\n\n\nFederation and World War II\n\nIn July 1938, MESA rejected an invitation to merge with the recently-organized Congress of Industrial Organizations, citing “fundamental differences in policy” while also arguing the CIO's established union in the auto-industry, United Autoworkers (UAW), was run by a “quasi-dictatorship.”[10] In 1942, MESA became a founding member of the Confederated Unions of America. A 1944 article in the American Economic Review described the group as “...a class-conscious group far to the left of the AFL internationals and even most of the CIO affiliates.”[11]\n\nMESA refused to adopt a no-strike pledge that other unions had agreed to during World War II. As such, it was targeted by the federal government via the National Labor Relations Board; in jurisdictional disputes with the CIO, the government consistently decided against MESA. In response, MESA's membership went on strike. In November 1944, United States Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson wrote to MESA's Smith saying “Your strikes...represent no honest grievance...You are striking our fighting men from the rear. The War Department insists these strike be stopped at once.” MESA refused to end the strike.[12]\n\n\nTaft-Hartley and CIO Affiliation\n\nIn 1947, the Taft–Hartley Act became law. One of its provisions required union leaders to file affidavits with the United States Department of Labor declaring that they were not supporters of the Communist Party and had no relationship with any organization seeking the “overthrow of the United States government by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional means”, to which MESA acquiesced. The prevailing Red Scare, which began in 1947 and coincided with a period of McCarthyism, put a damper on popular support for radical unions like the Mechanics. In 1954, MESA absorbed the Metal and Machinery Workers Industrial Union (MMWIU), which had previously been affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World. In December of that year, MESA and its 12,000 members affiliated with the former jurisdictional opponent in the CIO.[13] A year later, in December 1955, the CIO, with the Mechanics as an affiliate, merged with the AFL to form the AFL-CIO.\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8]  Case Western Reserve University |accessdate=6 April 2020 |language=en |date=11 May 2018}}\n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n","title":"Mechanics Educational Society of America"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the origins of the Mechanics Educational Society of America.

She believed that a major corporation had been benefiting from a collection of well-connected contracts that were costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse.\n\nAlthough she was warned against it by supervisors, she blew the whistle on national TV in front of a Senate committee. \"My name is Bunnatine H. Greenhouse. I have agreed to voluntarily appear at this hearing,\" she addressed the committee.\n\nBunny Greenhouse was an unlikely whistleblower. In 2005, Greenhouse was the highest-ranked civilian at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. \n\n \"When I took my oath of office it said that you will conduct the business of contracting impartially … and with preferential treatment toward none. I saw preferential treatment toward KBR,\" she told \"Whistleblower\" host Alex Ferrer in \"Bunny's War: The Case Against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\" \n\nKBR was Kellogg Brown and Root — back then, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the oil services firm Halliburton.  In the weeks prior to the invasion, Greenhouse learned that KBR was being considered for a massive no-bid contract known as Restore Iraqi Oil, or RIO.\n\n\"What was the size of this contract?\" Ferrer asked.\n\n\"Seven billion dollars,\" she replied.\n\nWhat Greenhouse didn't know is that even more powerful forces may have been involved.\n\n\"A lot of attention fell on Dick Cheney, the vice president, and the fact was that he had been the head of Halliburton for … six years,\" Vanity Fair journalist Michael Shnayerson explained. \"So, the suspicion began to grow that perhaps Cheney was steering government contracts to KBR.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Dick Cheney told CBS News that the former vice president severed all ties with Halliburton and KBR in the summer of 2000 when he became candidate for vice president.  \n\nA representative for KBR said \"it's unfortunate that misinformation and myths about KBR's role in supporting the military in Iraq continue to be circulated. These assertions have repeatedly been shown to be false.\"\n\nFor Greenhouse, biting her tongue was never an option. \"I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to contracts awarded to KBR represents the most blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of my professional career,\" she told the Senate committee.\n\nA 2004 government report decided the RIO contract was properly awarded. But the Army eventually split up the contract and, as Greenhouse had requested from the beginning, opened it up to competition.  \n\n\"Eventually, your enemies at the Army Corps of Engineers caught up with you,\" Ferrer commented.\n\n\"I felt that I was physically being threatened,\" Greenhouse replied. \"They set up a booby trap that caused me to fall,\" she added.\n\nBorn and raised in Rayville, Louisiana, Greenhouse and her six siblings grew up poor in the segregated south. Her parents instilled in her and her siblings a strong sense of morals, integrity and honor; no excuse for being less than the best. In the 1960s, she became the first African American teacher at the newly integrated Unity H.S.\n\nIn 1997, she accepted a job with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. She was hired by Lt. General Joe Ballard and was the first African American woman to become the head of contracting within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nGreenhouse started to notice a \"good ole boys club\" forming again at USACE after her boss and mentor, Lt. General Ballard, retired in 2000. Then, in the weeks leading up to the Iraq War in 2003, she attended a top-secret meeting at the Pentagon to discuss details of the Restore Iraqi Oil contract. Present in the room were representatives of Kellogg Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, Cheney's former employer. \n\nGreenhouse was concerned about awarding KBR with the no-bid, 5-year contract and urged to accept other bids and limit the duration of the deal. But her objections were never addressed, and KBR received the contract. Later, it was revealed in a draft audit that the company had overcharged the government for fuel purchases by $61 million. She ultimately testified in front of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee.\n\nGreenhouse was the highest-ranked civilian at the Army Corp and she was incredibly good at her job. Because the top brass at USACE couldn't actually fire her, which was a perk of having a high station in the government, they demoted her. When this happened, she was stripped of her security clearance and sent off to a remote cubicle somewhere; she was basically condemned to oblivion. After she filed her whistleblower lawsuit, someone placed a trip wire placed around her cubicle and she fell, permanently damaging her knee.\n\nThe Defense Authorization Act Of 2009 reformed some of the very contracting practices that Greenhouse had objected to five years earlier and it limited the duration of certain no-bid contracts.\n\nGreenhouse filed a mixed case lawsuit against the Department of Defense and the Army Corps of Engineers. The whistleblower case claimed that Greenhouse had been retaliated against for speaking out and had faced discrimination based on race, age, and gender. In July 2011, she agreed to a settlement of $970,000.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_\"Bunny's War: The Case Against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\"__ aired Friday, June 28 at 8/7c on CBS.  _\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about KBR?","answers":[{"answer":"KBR was Kellogg Brown and Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton.

Inside of one lived a quiet and peaceful man, and in the other lived a beautiful and cheerful woman. Neither of them, however, liked being outside the confines of their own house.\n\nOne day, the peaceful man ventured across the street to the other house and was invited inside. The two strangers visited, shared laughs, told stories, and enjoyed the others company. At the end of the day, the man returned to his house.\n\nThe next day he visited again, but instead of talking, he started to slowly repair the inside of the run down house. When one of his repairs would break, he would immediately come over to fix the damage with a smile on his face. The two housekeepers became used to seeing one another each day, and eventually, the woman would come over to the man's house to visit. The woman noticed that his house looked much worse on the inside than hers, and started to sneak inside at night while he was asleep to make repairs. When the man would try to fix something himself, or repair damages to his own house, he would fail, and sometimes even make things worse. But the next morning,  he would notice that things would be fixed. This puzzled the man and he decided to ask the woman about it the next time she came over.\n\nThe next evening they spent together, he asked and she informed the man of what she had been doing, and the man asked why. She replied,\n\"Because people who show a caring and wholesome heart deserve to receive the same treatment they give to others.\" The man became confused.\n          \"But I am a shut in. Nobody gives to me, and I don't give to them. Why does somebody like me deserve somebody as wonderful as you?\"\n\nThe woman put her hand on the man's shoulder and looked into his dark brown eyes. She noticed a hurt that had always seemed to hide beneath his smile, a sorrow that hadn't been revealed in a very long time. She said in a soft and gentle voice: \"Somebody that prefers to be alone does not always prefer being lonely. There is always somebody who will care.\"\n\nThe two embraced, and the man sobbed and became limp in the woman's arms. Once he had calmed down, the woman kissed him on the cheek and returned to her house without saying a word.\n\nThe following morning, he noticed another man performing landscaping on her lawn, painting the outside of her house, and cleaning her patio. Each day the house would look more and more beautiful. He became sad that the woman had found somebody else to do her work, and started to loathe the landscaper that would beautify her house all the time.\n\nThe woman remained indoors all day, trying to make the interior of her house look as pleasant as the exterior. However, most of her attempts at repairs or renovation were disasters. The person she hired was no help, and was only after her money. She began to miss her neighbors company, along with his sturdy repairs and his gentle smile. As days went by, the man and woman thought about each other more and more, but never saw each other.\n\nOne afternoon, the woman heard her doorbell ring. Knowing it wasn't the landscaper she hired, she curiously approached the peephole of the door. Seeing that nobody was outside, she opened the door and looked for pranksters. Looking down, she saw a small, dirty looking tin with a bow neatly placed on top of it.\n\nThe interior of the unkempt tin was extravagantly decorated with soft velvet from top to bottom, and in the center laid a simple necklace with a key on it, resting on top of a small note. Putting the necklace on, she unfolded the small note and noticed little droplets of water on the page.\n\n\"You are the only one that can make it feel less empty. Please take care of it for me while I'm gone. I must go, but I will return one day.\"\n\nAfter reading it the woman dropped to her knees, and tears started to form in her tightly shut eyes. For what seemed like years, she spent the next few months wishing the man would come back and going into his house to take care of it while he was gone. She noticed that every little thing she had done to the house remained unchanged, as if he never tried to correct the small mistakes she had made.\n\nEventually, the man returned. The woman was thrilled and filled with happiness, but also saddened by the fact that the man no longer came across the street to visit her. A few days after his return, she noticed he was packing his belongings into boxes. Fearing that he might move away, the woman mustered up the courage to go talk to the man.\n\n\"Why are you putting everything into boxes?\" The woman asked.\n    \"Because,\" the man replied solemnly, \"I am looking to create new memories and find a fresh start.\" The woman said nothing and returned to her house, slamming the door and fighting back tears.\n\nThe next morning, the man was loading his belongings into a moving truck when he saw a pile of boxes bigger than his own sitting in the woman's lawn. He walked across the street to the pile, and saw a note taped to one of the boxes.\n\n\"I will always love you, and I promise that I will always be next to you. No matter where we go.\"\n\nThe man's face turned into a broad smile, and he looked up to see the woman on her front patio, looking right back at him, the necklace glistening in the sunlight. She ran into his arms and they kissed for what felt like an eternity. The pair continued to load all of their belongings into the one moving truck, and left that very evening. Holding hands with his true love, the man looked into the rear view mirror to see the sun setting on the old, abandoned houses for the last time, and felt what was truly a pure happiness. An odd and relieving sensation washed over him like a tide, as he realized that he would never have to search for anything in his life, as long as he lived.\n","title":"Some OC for you all to enjoy"},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize what the story has to say about loneliness.

There are also ten elemental damage types, consisting of four base elements (cold, electricity, heat and toxin) and the six combinations formed by modding two elements together. Each of these damage types is stronger or weaker against specific enemy types.\n\nHowever, each of these damage types also have “status effects” that can be applied based on a “procedural random chance” percentage, often known as procs. Impact procs cause enemies to stagger, Puncture procs reduce the enemy’s damage output by a flat 30%, and Slash procs inflict “bleed” damage over time. Slash has long been considered the most powerful of these effects, primarily because Slash procs stack on top of one another and scale with weapon damage, while both Puncture and Impact procs could only have their flat effects refreshed.\n\nLEVELING THE FIELD:\n\nThose of you who watched our most recent Devstream will remember Khora, our next Warframe. Her powers allow players to switch between Impact, Puncture and Slash type modes, influencing the damage skew of her abilities. We saw this exciting new idea as an opportunity to revisit the various status proc types, and shake things up a bit!\n\nIn an update coming soon, we will be making changes to IPS status effects and proc damage calculation. Our primary goal was improving Impact and Puncture; both of these procs will now _scale in effectiveness_, based on the damage dealt. An Impact proc with a small damage output (like a single Akstilletto bullet) will still only cause a short stagger, while an Impact proc with high damage output (like a Vulkar shot) can scale all the way up to a ragdoll, temporarily immobilizing them. In a similar manner, Puncture procs will now scale in effectiveness from 10% to 75% damage reduction, based on the damage dealt at the time of proc. Slash will continue working as it does now, stacking multiple status effects on top of one another.\n\nCOVERING OUR BASES:\n\nHere’s where the math starts to get complicated - for all you stat-savvy Saryns and min-maxing Mesas out there, read on!\n\nOur more observant theorycrafters may see a flaw in the examples given above - these new damage-scaling procs would favour weapons that can output large damage amounts all at once, like snipers. In order to help rapid fire weapons compete in this regard, we are also making a systemic change to repeating procs: additional status effects will not “reproc”, but will instead additively increase the effectiveness of the existing proc. The upgraded proc is calculated using the damage total from the original proc and the new proc added together. For Puncture, this also refreshes the duration of the proc.\n\nWe are also making a change in how a proc’s associated damage output is calculated - before, a Slash proc would scale based on the weapon’s total base damage output. Now, all procs will be calculated using ONLY the damage type of the proc that is being inflicted. Players may feel encouraged to focus their weapon builds around certain damage types in order to consistently inflict powerful procs, or go for raw damage across several damage types to inflict multiple procs at once!\n\nTo help visualize how these changes will look, let's deep dive into the physical damage types to see how they play out in-game:\n\nIMPACT now serves as a great means of crowd control. Got a Corpus Tech threatening your excavator? Immobilize priority targets by unloading your Akstillettos, giving you more time to address the threat. Overwhelmed by an army of MOAs? Level entire rooms with something like a Strun!\n\nPUNCTURE can be used to minimize enemy lethality for frames with less survivability. Using high status puncture melees like Boltace or Endura, go blow-for-blow with Butchers and Powerfists without breaking a sweat. And if your Lex Prime can’t oneshot the Heavy Gunner rumbling towards your defense point, the enemy’s damage will be diminished long enough to safely deal the finishing blow.\n\nSLASH works the same as it ever did, stacking bleed damage over time to make short work of enemies. Your 100% status Tigris Prime will still eviscerate single targets with multiple procs, while something like a Galatine will still inflict more serious singular procs in a wider area - ‘tis but a scratch.\n\nFINAL INTENTIONS:\n\nIt's important that everyone understands our goals and what led us to the above changes. When designing Khora, an Impact/Puncture/Slash based frame, we knew it was time to bring up Impact and Puncture to Slash competitive levels of desirability thanks to long-term feedback. Having a frame specialize in the physical damage types is a pretty appropriate way to debut changes! Please approach all feedback with the understanding that from our end, our goal is a more interesting systemic change. Any edge case things that feel like massive nerfs should be civilly listed so we can address.\n\n...AND WHAT ABOUT ELEMENTALS!?\n\nWith little time remaining in the year to properly iterate, we decided to split this into two parts. Part 1 is Physical and it is coming soon on PC. Part 2 is Elemental and coming in 2018. We didn't want to release something wholesale over the Holidays that we wouldn't be around to properly monitor. You will be seeing a new Dev Workshop in 2018 on Part 2 - Happy Holidays!\n\n EDITED DECEMBER 19, 2017 BY [DE]REBECCA\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about damage types?","answers":[{"answer":"There are three physical damage types: Impact, Puncture, and Slash.

Sonar systems—first developed by the U.S. Navy to detect enemy submarines—generate slow-rolling sound waves topping out at around 235 decibels; the world’s loudest rock bands top out at only 130. These sound waves can travel for hundreds of miles under water, and can retain an intensity of 140 decibels as far as 300 miles from their source.\n\nThese rolling walls of noise are no doubt too much for some marine wildlife. While little is known about any direct physiological effects of sonar waves on marine species, evidence shows that whales will swim hundreds of miles, rapidly change their depth (sometime leading to bleeding from the eyes and ears), and even beach themselves to get away from the sounds of sonar.\n\nIn January 2005, 34 whales of three different species became stranded and died along North Carolina’s Outer Banks during nearby offshore Navy sonar training. Other sad examples around the coast of the U.S. and elsewhere abound, notably in recent years with more sonar testing going on than ever before. According to the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), which has campaigned vigorously to ban use of the technology in waters rich in marine wildlife, recent cases of whale strandings likely represent a small fraction of sonar’s toll, given that severely injured animals rarely make it to shore.\n\nIn 2003, NRDC spearheaded a successful lawsuit against the Navy to restrict the use of low-frequency sonar off the coast of California. Two years later a coalition of green groups led by NRDC and including the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), the League for Coastal Protection, Cetacean Society International, and Ocean Futures Society upped the ante, asking the federal courts to also restrict testing of more intense, harmful and far ranging mid-frequency types of sonar off Southern California’s coastline.\n\nIn filing their brief, the groups cited Navy documents which estimated that such testing would kill some 170,000 marine mammals and cause permanent injury to more than 500 whales, not to mention temporary deafness for at least 8,000 others. Coalition lawyers argued that the Navy’s testing was in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act.\n\nTwo lower courts upheld NRDC’s claims, but the Supreme Court ruled that the Navy should be allowed to continue the use of some mid-frequency sonar testing for the sake of national security. “The decision places marine mammals at greater risk of serious and needless harm,” says NRDC’s Joel Reynolds.\n\nEnvironmental groups are still fighting the battle against the sonar, lobbying the government to curtail testing, at least during peacetime, or to at least ramp up testing gradually to give marine wildlife a better chance to flee affected areas. “The U.S. Navy could use a number of proven methods to avoid harming whales when testing mid-frequency sonar,” reports IFAW’s Fred O'Regan. “Protecting whales and preserving national security are not mutually exclusive.”\n\nCONTACTS: NRDC, www.nrdc.org; IFAW, www.ifaw.org.\n\nEARTHTALK IS PRODUCED BY E/THE ENVIRONMENTAL MAGAZINE.

There weren't any children playing, no mother tending to their young; there was nothing captivating about it. However, I still remember how green the grass was, the laughter of the children, soccer moms walking their dogs, but mostly, I remember her. Her green eyes, her elegance, and the way her hips swayed to and fro when she walked. The way her long black hair would look when the wind picked up and the way I laughed whenever she dropped something. \n\nEvery day at 10 a.m., I would see her perched on the park bench reading a book or a magazine of some sort. She'd sit there for about an hour or two, and then she would leave without anyone turning their heads but mine. It was as if I was that creepy kid in your math class who'd always stare at you whenever you got up to sharpen your pencil. My eyes were locked onto her and disappointment would wash over me whenever I lost sight.  \n\nThis routine continued for many months, and she hadn't noticed me for I had said not a single word. I was never going to, because I didn't want to ruin the perfect image I had of her. It was better to admire from afar. Better to be unseen than noticed I thought. But some nights I'd wish I said something to her, just one word like hi. Still I didn't. It was my fear of rejection and what is she thought I was weird or creepy? What if she noticed I stared at her? All of these questions running through my mind and I could've said something, but I didn't.\n\nOn those I walked back to my place to think. Once I got home, the pungent smell of cigarettes filled up my nostrils and for some odd reason, everything seemed pointless:  My life, my career as a writer, my love life, evens my cat's life. So, I just began to wallow in my self-pity until I fell asleep. It's better if I don't go tomorrow I thought to myself. I lacked the gumption to ever talk to her so why should I go? But that night I had a dream that she spoke to me - she sounded beautiful - and that's all I remember. I woke up and jumped out of bed, took a shower, and put on my best dress. Then, I continued to run to the park maybe the dream was a sign that she was going to be mine. I bumped into people. I might’ve bumped into an old lady, but I didn’t care. \nAfter 20 minutes of people yelling at me and frantic running, I arrived at the park just after 10 a.m., and I saw her - she was the first person I noticed, but she wasn't alone.  She was with a man - most likely her husband - and two children. They all looked happy - no troubles in the world. It was a bittersweet moment because she looked so happy when I have always seen her look so forlorn. After standing there for two minutes, I walked away and at that moment, I felt my whole world fall apart - piece by piece.\n\nOn my walk home I wondered if there was any animosity brewing between them – maybe he cheated and she secretly hates him, or maybe they just look happy and they’re planning to get a divorce. An overwhelming sense of false hope came and went away when I knew all of it wasn’t true. She’ll be there tomorrow I thought.

This edict may be surprising to hear, especially as emphatically as Blevins said it when we spoke at a recent Samsung event.\n\nThough Blevins isn’t shy about being married, and his more than 10 million subscribers include people of every gender identity, the internet’s love of gossip has convinced the Twitch star not to invite women to participate in his __ _Fortnite Battle Royale_ livestreams. With fame comes scrutiny of every thing you say or do, he suggested, and that can sometimes lead to questions about who you’re sleeping or flirting with on the sly.\n\n“If I have one conversation with one female streamer where we’re playing with one another, and even if there’s a hint of flirting, that is going to be taken and going to be put on every single video and be clickbait forever,” Blevins told Polygon.\n\nThere’s some truth to the idea that flirting can lead to YouTube clickbait and invasive questions — Blevins has asked some himself when playing with other well-known (male) streamers. Take the clip below, from a Twitch stream with _Fortnite_ star Ali “Myth” Kabbani.\n\nImane “Pokimane” Anys is another big name on Twitch whose popularity grew rapidly over the last year, and when she started playing _Fortnite_ on streams with Kabbani, viewers began to ask: Are they dating? Fans assume Twitch streamers are in a relationship just as often as they speculate on their marital status. And that apparently includes Blevins, who used his mega-platform to further perpetuate that rumor.\n\nWhether or not it’s true that Anys and Kabbani are together is, obviously, their business. But when it comes to his relationship with streamer Jessica “Jghosty” Blevins, who often appears on her husband’s channel, Blevins is happy to open up about his devotion.\n\n“[Not being connected to other women online,] that was something I made 100-percent sure,” he said. It was his decision alone to keep his streaming partners men-only. “That was not even her. She had nothing to do with it. That was me being, ‘I love our relationship,’ and, ‘No — I’m not even gonna put you through that.’”\n\nA growing Twitch means a diminishing sense of privacy, especially for women on the platform. Female streamers have opened up before about the difficulty in maintaining a separation between their Twitch personas and who they are offline — often at the behest of viewers who demand answers, lest they assume what’s going on for themselves.\n\nRespect is a major part of playing _Fortnite_ and other games. Yet women often are the receiving end of anything but: “Twitch thots,” harassment, warding off obsessive or judgmental viewers are all serious concerns for well-known female streamers. In contrast to the reality of being a woman on Twitch, Blevins’ choice to draw a line feels like a conservative gesture — even a familiar, divisive one.\n\n“There hasn’t been a single female gamer or streamer on Twitch or anything like that who’s been upset about that,” he said of possible pushback. “I honestly think that [...] it’s just kinda like a respect thing.”\n\nNinja may not hear criticism of his decision, but similar gender-based views have received pushback in the political sphere — think of the outcry surrounding Vice President Mike Pence’s supposed marital boundaries. Still, the Twitch streamer is sticking to his absolute, which he believes is the only choice.\n\n“The only way to avoid that [gossip] is to not play with them at all.”\n\nUPDATE: Ninja has since responded to — and stood by — his comments to us on Twitter.

Democrats, and others, see Trump's criticisms of federal law enforcement as a dangerous attempt to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.]\n\n[Daniel Dale]\n\nDaniel DaleWashington Bureau Chief\n\n__Wed., Jan. 31, 20185 min. read\n\nArticle was updated Feb. 01, 2018\n\nWASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump is at war with his own law enforcement officials. More than ever before, he has backup from his party.\n\nAnd law enforcement has started pushing back.\n\nThe day after Trump’s State of the Union address was dominated by an extraordinary series of developments in which the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice challenged Trump both on the record and through what appeared to be anonymous leaks to CNN.\n\nThe until-recently-unusual spectre of the “law-and-order” party attempting to undermine law enforcement agencies comes during the ongoing special counsel investigation of the Trump campaign’s links to the Russian government. Democrats, and others, see Republicans’ criticism as an attempt to protect the president by diminishing public faith in Robert Mueller’s probe.\n\n“We’re no longer dealing in the realm of facts and reason when it comes to grave matters of security and justice,” Amanda Carpenter, a Republican former communications director for Sen. Ted Cruz, wrote in Politico. “We are, at Donald Trump’s behest, fully engulfed in a narrative explicitly designed to impugn and destroy the credibility of the law enforcement agency tasked with investigating the Trump campaign’s relationship with Russia during the 2016 election.”\n\nIn seeking short-term political gain, Trump and his allies will do long-term damage to federal law enforcement, said Matthew Miller, Justice spokesperson during the Obama administration. He pointed to the effects of conservatives’ attacks on other pillars of U.S. society.\n\n“The first one they went after, starting decades ago, was the media. Now Republicans don’t believe what they hear on any channel other than Fox News. Then they moved to scientists … and now you see in polls Republicans who just don’t believe in scientists. They’ve turned on universities, and you see this rising discontent among conservatives about university. They are now turning on federal law enforcement,” Miller said in an interview.\n\n“And if a significant percentage of the population — 35, 40 per cent — believes that federal law enforcement is biased, you’ll see those people less likely to co-operate with investigations, less likely to blow the whistle, and less likely to believe DOJ prosecutors when they sit on juries. It is extremely damaging to the long-term ability of those institutions to do their jobs.”\n\nOthers said Trump’s actions were risking deep damage to his own government.\n\n“The growing and dizzying array of threats by Trump, and threats by officials to resign in response to Trump’s threats, suggest that this is not a stable situation (how could it be?),” Jack Goldsmith, an assistant attorney general in George W. Bush’s Republican administration, said on Twitter on Saturday.\n\n“When Trump finally gets tired of being ignored and follows through on something stupid, the executive branch meltdown will be severe, to his enormous detriment (and hopefully not the country’s).”\n\n[Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, after a Tuesday meeting with House GOP members on Capitol Hill. Nunes is at the centre of a controversy over the potential release of a secret memo purported to show improper use of surveillance by the FBI and Justice Department.]\n\nThe Republican attacks have been encouraged by increasingly conspiratorial Fox coverage centred on what hosts have called a “Deep State” attempting to topple Trump. Senior Republican politicians who once kept their distance from such arguments have begun to echo their language.\n\n“Cleanse the organization,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said of the FBI on Tuesday.\n\nThe most dramatic developments on Wednesday centred on a secret four-page memorandum, authored by aides to pro-Trump chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, that Nunes claims will reveal “abuses” by the FBI in investigating Trump’s campaign.\n\nRepublican politicians have made a rallying cry of the phrase “release the memo.” (Ryan made his “cleanse” remark while speaking about the memo.) And they voted last week to do so despite the formal objections of a top Justice Department official who said a release “would be extraordinarily reckless” if Justice was not given a chance to review the memo and advise of possible harm.\n\nDonald Trump was overheard Tuesday telling a GOP lawmaker he is \"100 percent\" in favor of releasing a classified memo on the Russia investigation that has sparked a political fight pitting Republicans against the FBI and the Justice Department. (The Associated Press)\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...\n\nTrump has not made a final decision. But when a Republican congressman urged him after his Tuesday speech to release the memo, he breezily said, “Don’t worry, 100 per cent.”\n\nTrump’s hand-picked FBI director, Christopher Wray, and hand-picked Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, pleaded with Trump’s chief of staff on Monday not to release the memo, the Washington Post has reported. And then they went further.\n\nIn a move that has no obvious recent precedent, the FBI made its objections public on Wednesday — and effectively endorsed the view of Democrats who have called the memo highly misleading.\n\n“As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy,” the FBI said.\n\nLater in the afternoon, CNN broke two stories that further called into question Trump’s interactions with and statements about law enforcement.\n\nThe first reported that Trump had asked Rosenstein if Rosenstein was “on my team” — a request that echoes his widely criticized alleged request for “loyalty” from then-FBI director James Comey — and suggested to lawmakers questions they could ask Rosenstein to try to discredit the Mueller probe.\n\nThe second reported that Peter Strzok, the FBI agent removed from the Mueller probe over text messages in which he criticized Trump, had supported the FBI’s late-campaign decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. Republicans, including Trump, had previously seized on Strzok’s texts as evidence of FBI bias against him.\n\nAll of this comes just two days after the FBI’s deputy director, Andrew McCabe, stepped down under fierce pressure from Trump, who had accused him of bias because his wife’s Democratic campaign for a seat in Virginia’s state senate received political donations from allies of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an ally of Clinton.\n\nThat, in turn, came four days after the New York Times reported Trump had ordered Mueller’s firing but backed off when White House counsel Donald McGahn threatened to quit.\n\nAll of the turmoil raised bipartisan fears that Trump would attempt another round of firings — of Rosenstein, with whom he is now engaged in a multi-front battle, or perhaps of Mueller once more. Democrats have warned that terminating Mueller would create the biggest crisis of Trump’s presidency.\n\nIf Trump refrains or is restrained from self-harm, however, his Fox-aided campaign to persuade Americans not to trust law enforcement may create an outcome that works for him personally even as it hurts the country more broadly.\n\nIf Republican voters have scant faith in Mueller and the Justice Department, their representatives are especially unlikely to pursue justice in the form of impeachment or resignation pressure, no matter what the facts say.\n\nSaid Miller: “When Bob Mueller finishes his work, he may have damning evidence against the president — and there will be a certain percentage of Americans who just refuse to believe him.”\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize how the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice challenged Trump.","answers":[{"answer":"The FBI and DOJ challenged Trump by leaking to CNN about Trump's attempts to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

It’s really important for my family to have this piece, but there’s only so much we can do ourselves. Are you sure you can’t drop the price? Even a little?”\n\nThe salesman barely heard what she was saying. “N-name your price. We, uh, we can go from there.” He struggled to take his eyes off her chest.\n\nThe dark haired beauty took off her sunglasses and looked her “victim” in the eyes. Her gorgeous brown eyes looked full of innocent joy at the news, and she knew right then and there that she had him hook, line, and sinker. She damn near could have asked him to just give her the artifact for free and he would have done it.\n\nSometimes, Rosa felt bad for the sellers of her trinkets, but they almost always tried to oversell them. Probably usually got away with it with the older codgers who were trying to keep busy in their old age. She, on the other hand, knew what investing in those beauties was worth. Those objects told the story of the past. This is where we, as the human race, came from. This wasn’t some text in a history book from high school. This was the real deal. This was magic to Rosa, a way to view the past.\n\nThere was nothing more important.\n\n“Really?” Rosa reached into her beach bag and grabbed a pad of Post-Its and a pen, wrote down her price, and handed it too him, surreptitiously getting into the sexiest pose she knew. The salesman was now clearly and uncomfortably aroused and at this point, Rosa knew by experience, he would say yes to the deal just to get out of the awkward situation.\n\nThe salesman briefly looked at the note, sighed, knowing full well that in normal situations he would never dare accept the offer, and handed it back. “Fine.”\n\n“Yay!” Rosa exclaimed, keeping up the appearance that she was innocent. She again reached into her beach bag and grabbed her checkbook, filled it out for the amount she asked about, and handed it to the man. He grabbed it, opened up his briefcase, grabbed the object, handed it to Rosa, and quickly said his goodbyes, practically running to get away from her.\n\nRosa giggled to herself. She put the object into her beach bag and continued to sun herself, eventually falling asleep.\n\nWhen she heard rustling, she awoke to find someone digging through her bag. She was short, blonde and wearing a jogging outfit of short shorts and a sports bra. As soon as Rosa sat up, the blond woman stood up with the object in hand and ran away. Rosa realized the thief knew exactly what she was after; she wasn’t just some trash stealing some other woman’s junk.\n\nRosa jumped up and followed the woman. She was good at running on the sand and had trained herself to run barefoot on nearly any surface. So when the jogger ran onto the pavement, the fact that all Rosa was wearing was a very skimpy bikini didn’t bother her. She was going to get that object back.\n\nIt seemed, however, that thief was just as athletic as Rosa. She ran through cars and buildings. Rosa was just a little faster and was catching up with her, until the jogger displayed a skill that Rosa did not have: free running. She ran into an alley full of junk that would slow down normal people, but she just jumped and flipped over whatever she needed to and sped far ahead of Rosa.\n\nBut Rosa was resourceful. There was an idling motorcycle nearby that the beautiful artifact collector had no qualms about “borrowing.” She jumped on it and took off around the block in hopes of catching the thief off guard.\n\nWhen she rounded the corner, there was a little traffic and the blonde was just coming out of the alley. Rosa wove in and out to catch up. The jogger ran down another alley, this one clear. Rosa followed on the bike. The thief ran down another side alley, this one ended in a dead end with a overfilled dumpster.\n\nRosa sped up and, being so focused on her enemy, missed the brick laying on the ground in front of her. She flew off the bike as it flipped. Luckily she landed on the blond runner. Unfortunately, they both fell on the pile of garbage bags.\n\nStill, Rosa wasn’t about to let her get away. She pulled her up and punched her square in the jaw. Something else she trained herself in: mixed martial arts. The thief wasn’t too bad either. She got up and took a stance that proved she knew how to fight. She gave a high kick to Rosa, who easily blocked and countered it with a punch in the upper thigh, which would definitely bruise. The runner managed to hit with an uppercut. Rosa kicked the other woman in the shin, followed by an elbow in the gut, then one in the face, landing square on the nose. This left the thief dazed enough for Rosa to one more punch in the exact same spot.\n\nThe blond jogger fell straight back, not even trying to break her fall. When Rosa checked, she had no pulse and her eyes were rolled back in her head. She was dead.\n\nRosa checked her for her prize and, finding it, moved the corpse to the dumpster burying her in bags. She found a mostly clean rag and wiped the bike clean of any evidence of her from it. She casually walked back out the alley, taking another path. Then back to the beach. Luckily, no one bothered her stuff. She put the artifact in her bag, then put the bag in her car. She then went back and finished sunning herself, as if she were perfectly fine with killing someone, as if she had done it before.\n\nBecause she had. There was nothing more important to her than the artifacts and the stories they told.","title":"[AA] The Bikini Chase"},"questions":[{"question":"How did Rosa lose the artifacts in the first place?","answers":[{"answer":"Rosa was attacked by a jogger who stole the artifact from her.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer is not related to the question.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"It does not directly say she was attacked.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer is incorrect.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer should reflect that Rosa was chasing the thief.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"It is incorrect that Rosa was attacked.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[null,1,null,null,0],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"Why did Rosa use the seduction approach to get the salesman to drop his price?","answers":[{"answer":"She was a beautiful woman who used her attractiveness to her advantage.

The descent into Vanity Heights was a perfect contradiction. Darcy’s den was full of promises. The promises of allure, freedom, revelry. The promises of power and powder, regret, addiction. But the promise that Vanity Heights fulfilled best was not Darcy’s own. It was the promise flashed upon the television, upon the computer screen, canonised on the glossed pages of magazines. The expectations of how teenager life should be; the expectations, up until this night, crushed by education and responsibility. This was the promise that led Darcy’s guests down the stairs. Down the stairs into Vanity Heights. \n\nThe house had transformed into a delinquent ballroom. The girls dropped as low as their heels would allow; their men watched through the haze. Darcy was a dragon. A pink dragon, breathing about the toxic smoke of his habit. He was perched upon his barstool throne, positioned strategically in the centre of the room, when she arrived. \n“Celeste!” he exclaimed, prancing over to her, a stick of addiction in one hand and a glass of hobby in the other. She gave a long hug, a short conversation and an expected question. With a customary smile, Darcy gave to her an expected bottle of answer. \n\nThe party raved on, yet the revelry was muted by the brick wall that barricaded Celeste from the action. The rhythmic dripping of the basin tap was the only music Celeste had, yet she chose to reapply her face instead of dancing. She wanted to dance, though, and she knew Darcy would be waiting for her, so she rushed through her routine. She clasped onto her 50mL glass friend, already thrice-used, even though she had been in the bathroom only five minutes. \n        The drink was downed within seconds of being poured; the liquid sunk to her stomach. She could feel the warm tendrils, cooing words of friendship, branching through her chest, her stomach and finally, finally, back up to drown her mind; pulling her further from the world and closer to her weekend friends. \n        Six doses later, to finish the bottle, and she was ready to join them. \n\nNo one ever really knew why she was there. Good school, great grades, aspirations of business and law. Nevertheless, she was soon jiving and twisting and dropping on the floor, with Darcy and other men: around them and in their laps; their hands hoping to get in hers.  Her beholder lay seemingly dormant in her stomach; though its dark tendrils were tightening, strengthening their grip on Celeste, controlling her like a puppet with tangled strings. She thought the overseer a friend, a protector, but her body knew better.\n\nCeleste mapped her escape as soon as she felt it. Up the stairs, out of Vanity Heights, past the kitchen, into the garden bed just by the backdoor. She pushed through the crowd. Darcy saw her leave; he knew why, but he didn’t follow.  He never did. By the time she reached the stairs, the beast had revealed itself. A kraken, furious as red, limbs thrashing about inside of her, fighting desperately for an escape. Tentacles of fear, doubt, regret, disappointment. \n‘No,’ she thought once more, ‘I shouldn’t be disappointed.’ She knew she wasn't wasting her life; she was just having a little to drink. She wasn’t reckless and irresponsible; she was just a normal teenager. She was just having fun, she has earned it, she would stop after tonight, leave her alone. Her stomach was having none of that, though. She made a mistake by trying to fly the stairs two at a time. Her feet tangled and she fell, the first wave of expel surging from her, onto the steps above.\n\nWhilst the beast had once been considered friend, it had no more. It escaped her again, covering her hair, clothes, face. She tried to pull herself further up the stairs, but the sickly purple tentacles constricted about her and dragged her down; down, down, down, back into Vanity Heights.  \n‘Vile guardian’, she cried, ‘noxious saviour, foul beast, nefarious raper; first friend, now foe. Always, foe’. \nThe stench accompanying her disgrace engulfed her wholly, yet the contents of her stomach continued to emerge, again and again, onto the step where her head now resigned to lay. \n‘Never again,’ she sobbed, she promised to herself, her parents, her schoolwork. \n‘Never again,’ she promised, but Celeste’s promises were made to be broken and it was already too late. She lay shattered upon the stair case, empress turned peasant; her knight in glass armour had left her and once more she had nothing. The world around her spun, and sank, and faded to black. \n\n","title":"Vanity Heights"},"questions":[{"question":"Describe Celeste in action.

It featured the quarterback and the slogan: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. Just do it.”\n\nKaepernick, 30, has been without a team since opting out of his San Francisco 49ers contract in March 2017. In 2016 he was an originator of protests by NFL players, targeting racial injustice and police brutality, which often involve kneeling during the pre-game playing of the national anthem.\n\nDonald Trump has made the protests a key part of his appeal to his base, arguing that the players are disrespecting the anthem, the US flag and the military.\n\nOn Tuesday, the president told the rightwing website Daily Caller: “I think it’s a terrible message that [Nike] are sending and the purpose of them doing it, maybe there’s a reason for them doing it. But I think as far as sending a message, I think it’s a terrible message and a message that shouldn’t be sent. There’s no reason for it.”\n\nHe also said Nike paid him “a lot of rent” in New York and admitted that the protests and the Nike ad were “in another way … what this country is all about, that you have certain freedoms to do things that other people think you shouldn’t do”.\n\n“But I personally am on a different side of it,” Trump said.\n\nIn the following days, the president pursued the issue via Twitter. On Wednesday, he wrote: “Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN, Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? As far as the NFL is concerned, I just find it hard to watch, and always will, until they stand for the FLAG!”\n\nTrump did not supply evidence for his claim of “anger and boycotts” but opposition to the company’s move was expressed widely and in some instances creatively on social media.\n\nOn Friday, the morning after the full version of the Nike ad played during the Philadelphia Eagles v Atlanta Falcons NFL season opener, the president asked: “What was Nike thinking?”\n\nNike releases full ad featuring Colin Kaepernick - video\nEdison Trends’ analysis suggested the company will be thinking its gambit has worked, allowing it to surf familiar controversy and create a “Trump bump” all of its own.\n\n“Nike’s 2018 late summer sales show much the same trend as last year’s,” the company wrote, “with order volume decreasing slightly going into late August. The similarity decreases coming out of Labor Day weekend, however, with sales seeing a bigger bump on Monday and Tuesday than in the past.”\n\nEdison Trends said its analysis was based on “anonymised and aggregated e-receipts from more than 3 million consumers”.\n\nThe NFL has not resolved how to respond to or govern the protests, which were widely discussed again on Thursday after Eagles defensive end Michael Bennett sat down before the anthem had finished.\n\nIn July, in an open letter to league owners, the NBA great and Guardian sports columnist Kareem Abdul Jabbar wrote: “It’s been two years since Colin Kaepernick first took a knee to protest systemic racial injustice, especially police brutality, against people of color.\n\n“The worst thing about that isn’t that two years later we’re still debating whether players have the right to protest, it’s that not much has changed regarding what Kaepernick was protesting.”\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the arguments against Kaepernick.","answers":[{"answer":"Many commentators have responded skeptically to Kaepernick saying that he sacrificed everything.

It was invented by a college dropout named Richard Drew from Minnesota who worked for a small sandpaper company founded in 1902 called Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, later known as 3M. The name \"Scotch\" itself has an origin story almost as interesting as the invention of Scotch tape.\n\nBorn Richard Gurley Drew in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1899, Drew spent a year at the University of Minnesota in the Mechanical Engineering program before dropping out. He paid for that time at school and his correspondence school course in machine design by playing banjo, and he included all of that information in his application to the open position of lab technician with 3M. He got the job and was set on the path to make history.\n\nIn the 1920s, a two-tone paint job was popular for cars and a headache for automotive painters. The two-tone look was created by painting the car one color, applying a barrier of some sort to the painted portion, and then painting the next section. In order to get around the difficulties of this type of paint job, painters and mechanics tested out different ways to achieve the look. Unfortunately, their attempts tended to be less than successful. Some automotive shops would glue newspapers over the already painted sections while others used tape to prevent paint transfer. However those techniques often left a sticky residue on the paint that was difficult to remove. Sometimes, it would even mean the painters had to do the entire paint job over again.\n\nOne of Drew's responsibilities at 3M was to deliver samples of sandpaper to local automotive shops for testing, where he often overheard workers who were painting complain about the problems with tape used for these paint jobs. The twenty-three year old then lab assistant got the idea to create a new tape that would create a seal so that the paint wouldn't get through and yet also come off clean without leaving any sticky residue that ruined the paint finish. Drew used the adhesive that 3M utilized in the construction of its sandpaper as a starting point. From there, it took him two years of experimentation with different types of adhesives that he applied to a crepe paper backing to come up with the right combination. Thus, what would be called \"Scotch\" Masking Tape was born in 1925.\n\nThe success of the Scotch Brand Masking Tape allowed Drew to move up the ranks at 3M. In 1929, his position as technical director at the fabrication laboratory allowed him to pursue another idea. Cellophane had recently been invented by DuPont and was being used by grocers and bakers as a neat way to package their groceries. However, there wasn't a good way to seal the cellophane with tape because the colored backing ruined the clear look. So Drew and his team of inventors worked to create a tape that used this clear cellophane as a backing.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission\n\nUnfortunately, the machinery that 3M used in order to apply the adhesive to the cellophane backing tore the material, and the glue that worked for the masking tape appeared amber on the clear cellophane. The team ultimately invented new clear adhesive and modified machinery to handle the cellophane. The new tape was called Scotch Brand Cellulose Tape, but it appeared that it might have missed its opportunity with grocers and bakers despite ringing endorsements from several test clients. You see, DuPont had introduced into the market a cellophane that could be sealed with heat. Nonetheless, despite missing their original target market and being released during the Great Depression, the Scotch Brand Cellulose Tape thrived with various home uses.\n\nSo this all brings us back to how the term \"Scotch\" came to be associated with 3M's Masking and Cellulose tapes. When Drew and 3M began allowing car painters to test the new Scotch Brand Masking Tape, one painter supposedly complained about the lack of adhesive on the tape. One version of the story claims that the painter asked \"Why so Scotch with the adhesive?\" Another version states that the painter said \"Take this back to your Scotch bosses and tell them to put more adhesive on it.\"\n\nWhatever the case, in the 1920s, the term \"Scotch\" was a racial slang term that meant something or someone that was cheap or stingy. Based on the feedback, Drew applied more adhesive to the tape and ultimately branded the tape with the pejorative \"stingy\" name of \"Scotch.\"\n\nIf you liked this article, you might also enjoy:\n\n-   What the Company Name \"3M\" Stands For\n-   The Invention Nobody Wanted That Became One of the Top Selling Office Products of All Time\n-   A Brief History of the Ballpoint Pen and Whether NASA Really Spent Millions Developing a Pressurized Version Instead of Just Using Pencils\n-   Super Glue was Invented by Accident, Twice\n-   Who Invented Duct Tape\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_Sarah Stone writes for the mildly popular interesting fact website_ _TodayIFoundOut.com__.

He’d heard the story about a million times, from his friends and teachers and family, but he loved it best when his mother told it. Besides, the holiday was tomorrow, and hearing the story would help calm his excitement enough to sleep. His mother smiled at him and adjusted his pillows.\n\t“Are you sure? You practically know it by heart at this point,” she replied. He looked up at her and smiled an imploring smile.\n\t“Please?”\n\tHis mother laughed a little and sat down next to him on the bed. \n\t“Well...okay,” she whispered. She looked out his window and saw the holiday’s festive banner flapping from between two street lamps on the road. The banner read “Welcome to the 3045 Celebration of Die Sine Timere!” It waved back and forth in the wind. She turned back to Jerry, who was now propped up on his pillows and looking at her expectantly. \n\t“Okay, okay. Well,” she began, “Our story begins a long time ago, way back in 2015. Our ancestors who lived in that time were not like the way we are today. They were wild and crazy and very violent. The whole world was fighting a war with each other, and it was not the first time everyone had been fighting. They loved fighting each other, and they’d find any excuse to go to do it. They fought over religion and money and--”\n\t“And oil!” interrupted Jerry excitedly. \n\t“Yes, love, and oil. They even fought over who got to live where. It was very silly, but very dangerous. You see, millions of people, innocent people and soldiers alike were getting killed every day. It was horrible. Families were being ripped apart and nobody seemed to be able to make sense of it all. Nobody seemed to understand that everyone was the same underneath the skin and that war was a bad thing. Everyone bleeds red, darling, but our ancestors were too blinded by greed and hatred to see the common color underneath people’s skin. So they fought and fought for years. Finally, one day everyone woke up from sleeping and realized that they had killed off more than half the people on Earth. There used to be seven billion people living there, but now there was only about two billion. Some of the ground was permanently stained red from all the bloodshed. Even the clouds were damaged, and there were holes in the sky from all the bad things our ancestors had put up there. Things had gotten so bad that all the countries knew that they had to stop killing and stop wasting things and stop fighting.”\n\t“Did they stop killing each other, Mummy?” asked Jerry, even though he already knew the answer.\n\t“Yes, they did, darling. All the countries came together and talked about their problems and decided to stop all wars forever. Everyone began to get along, slowly but surely, and the people started sharing their things with each other. Nobody got called any names and everyone was equal. The first few years of peace were a little scary, because people weren’t sure how long it was going to last. But as the fourth year of peace passed, it became obvious to everyone that it was here to stay. All the leaders of all the countries came together that year and decided that there should be a day of remembrance and happiness and celebration as a global holiday, to be celebrated until the end of peace. They put this holiday on August 21st, which was the day all the wars ended. They decided to call this day “Die Sine Timere,” which is from a very very old language called Latin, and it means “Day Without Fear.” They said that on this day, all the people were to celebrate another year of peace and remember our mistakes in the past to keep us safe in the future. They said that people could celebrate and remember any way they saw fit, but they must be sure to celebrate it each year. Our country celebrates by having large block parties and getting all the communities together for a good time. And for you and all the other children, darling, it’s the one night of the year where you don’t have to go to bed before midnight. You get to stay up very late. And before everyone does go to bed on the night of Die Sine Timere, each family sits together in silent meditation to remember those who died and to help us remain peaceful for the following year.”\n\t“Tell me about the lanterns, Mummy. Don’t forget the lanterns,” whispered Jerry, whose eyes were closed now. He was not quiet asleep yet, just listening quietly to the story of his favorite holiday in peace. \n\t“Ah, yes, the lanterns,” said his mother, who now was stroking her son’s hair gently as she spoke. “Well, in all the countries around the world, there is one thing that all our ceremonies of peace have in common. Every single person or family makes a special lantern out of biodegradable paper, and they each write a wish for the future or a memory of the past on that lantern. Then, at exactly midnight, each person or family lights the lantern and sends it into the sky, and all the wishes and memories get to soar the night skies together. It’s very beautiful and is a symbol of our unity and peace.”\n\t“It’s like watching all our wishes come true,” whispered Jerry. \n\t“That it is, my love. That it is,” replied his mother, “And every year, the whole world does the same thing. For one day a year, we remember our unity and how lucky we are to be at peace. Each person meditating or releasing a lantern or playing in the park during the day is a promise for the future. We will remain peaceful, so long as we have this hope.” She stopped, for that was the end of the story. She and her son sat quietly together for a moment, before Jerry let out a contented sigh and rolled on his side, eyes still shut tight. \n\tHis mother looked down at his little sleeping face and smiled. She leaned down and gently kissed his forehead before getting up off the bed. She tucked the blankets up to his chin and turned to walk away. \n\t“Mummy?” Jerry said quietly.\n\t“Yes, darling?” said his mother, turning back towards her son.\n\t“Goodnight, Mummy. I love you.”\n\t“I love you too, Jerry. Goodnight.”\n\nShe shut off his light and headed downstairs to prepare the rice paper for the lanterns for tomorrow night, so that she and her son could silently watch all their wishes come true.

The study also provides more evidence that bisexuality is a distinct sexual orientation in women.\n\n“I was mainly interested in this topic because certain patterns seemed to be accruing in the academic literature regarding bisexual individuals, and bisexual women in particular. Bisexual women differ in some important ways––such as personality, sex drive, and relative openness to casual sex––from both their heterosexual and their lesbian counterparts,” said Scott W. Semenyna of University of Lethbridge, the corresponding author of the study.\n\n“My specific interest in the overlap between sexual orientation, Dark Triad traits (psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism), and sociosexuality sprang from two key findings. First, bisexual women report elevated sociosexuality (i.e., greater comfort with, desire for, and engagement in uncommitted sexual activity) compared to both heterosexual or lesbian women. Second, bisexual women report slightly lower levels of two personality traits––honesty/humility, and conscientiousness––than other sexual orientation groups.”\n\n“These personality traits have both been related to higher levels of Dark Triad traits, and also greater sociosexuality,” Semenyna told PsyPost. “These past findings suggest that female sexual orientation may share some unique relationships with both personality, and sexuality related variables, and I wanted to dig deeper into those potential connections.”\n\nThe researchers found that bisexual women tended to score higher on measures of sociosexuality and psychopathy than strictly heterosexual and lesbian women.\n\nThe findings were based on two surveys of a total of 1,093 female students at a Midwestern Canadian University. The study utilized the Kinsey scale of sexual attraction, which ranges from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual. In the very middle of the scale are individuals who are mostly heterosexual, equally heterosexual and homosexual, and mostly homosexual.\n\n“The big-picture take away from this study is that sociosexuality shares a curvilinear (inverted-U) relationship with female sexual orientation,” Semenyna explained. “Heterosexual and lesbian women don’t tend to differ from one another in their relative caution towards uncommitted sexual activity. Women towards the middle of the sexual orientation spectrum, especially those who are ‘moderately bisexual,’ are somewhat less cautious about uncommitted sexual activity.”\n\n“Alongside these shifts in sociosexuality are shifts in some Dark Triad personality traits, particularly psychopathy,” Semenyna told PsyPost. “These shifts are subtle, only about as large as typical sex differences in the traits, but they’re interesting. (Men typically score higher in all Dark Triad traits, as well as interest in casual sex, than do women.)”\n\n“Primarily such evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that female bisexuality and female homosexuality are the result of different developmental processes. If female bisexuality and homosexuality were simply the result of the same underlying developmental processes, one would expect that any differences between heterosexual and bisexual women in personality or interest in casual sex would be even larger when comparing heterosexual and lesbian women.”\n\n“Instead, what we observe is that lesbian and heterosexual women don’t differ in these variables, despite drastic difference in who they are sexually attracted to,” Semenyna said. “On the other hand, bisexual women are higher in these traits than heterosexual or lesbian women, while being attracted to some degree to both males and females.”\n\nThe study does have some limitations.\n\n“While research into female sexuality and women’s sexual orientation has grown in the last few decades, we are in desperate need of more data to bridge the substantial gaps in our understanding,” Semenyna remarked.\n\n“The biggest caveat in the present study is that the sexual orientation differences in psychopathy have not yet been replicated. The study adds support to other findings that bisexual women are more interested in casual sex, and engage in it more often (often with men). Other aspects of the study require replication, ideally by independent researchers.”\n\n“The other caveat is that this study was conducted on an extremely WEIRD sample (i.e., Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic). It’s unclear whether these differences apply only to university students, if similar differences may exist in the general population, or what possible cross-cultural variation exists in these patterns,” Semenyna said.\n\n“The cross-sectional nature of the study also prevents any causal connections from being drawn. First we have to establish these potential differences as reliable, then we have to interpret why these difference may exist and what they mean. In short, this study is an extremely small thread in a large tapestry that is slowly being woven, but is far from complete.”\n\nSemenyna also emphasized that the study should not be misinterpreted as an attack on bisexuality or bisexual women.\n\n“I’ve seen certain criticisms online of the study that it suggests that bisexual women are ‘slutty,’ or that we are trying to paint bisexual women in a negative light. Essentially the research is being accused of being ‘biphobic,'” he explained.\n\n“I think this is unfortunate for several reasons. The first of which is that the purpose of science is to investigate and understand, and report results regardless of how well they fit our preconceptions and preferences. Scientific investigation of sexual minorities is an important step towards greater understanding, and ultimately greater acceptance.”\n\n“The second reason is that I don’t see anything inherently wrong with people being comfortable with and pursuing casual sexual behavior, and having the freedom to do so. The sexual orientation differences in sociosexuality, as well as psychopathy, are only about as large as the typical sex differences found in these traits, with men on average scoring slightly higher than women on average,” Semenyna said.\n\n“To suggest that these differences in sociosexuality or psychopathy paint bisexual women in a negative light is to simultaneously smear men, who similarly score higher than heterosexual women on these traits. To view normal variation (i.e., diversity) in human personality and sexual behavior as somehow problematic is ultimately counterproductive to both scientific progress on these topics, and social acceptance.”\n\nThe study, “Not Straight and Not Straightforward: the Relationships Between Sexual Orientation, Sociosexuality, and Dark Triad Traits in Women“, Charlene F.

He walked into the room trying to assess his surroundings quickly while still maintaining his composure. The room was medium sized. Guards flanked the doors and lined the walls. The table in the center contained a machine, placed in front of its terrified operator, and wires leading towards--Daniel heard the door lock behind him, sealing him in with that ... _thing_. The creature lay in the center of the room, its presence consuming and demanding. It did nothing to warrant this attention, it lacked even the slightest hint of movement, yet it commanded the attention of every human. Daniel approached the table.\n\nHis steps reverberated throughout the room, cleaving the silence.\n\nEach step brought discomfort.\n\nDaniel hid is unease.\n\nHe wore his face like a mask.\n\nBut, his eyes tore the room apart instinctively, looking for separation.\n\nYet, he continued forward.\n\nDaniel closed the distance between him and the thing until he was close enough to look down upon it.\n\nHe dragged the chair back. There was a sigh of relief in the room as the sound put an end to the silence. The guards readjusted their weapons; the operator began to fiddle with his equipment; and the thing … rippled. Perhaps it was a welcoming-- Daniel sneered, or a challenge. Daniel looked at the operator who continued to nervously fiddle with his equipment in a transfixed manner.\n\nDaniel quickly lifted his briefcase onto the table, unconsciously determined to keep the silence at bay. The briefcase opened with a satisfying click. He spread the pages across his end of the table. He hadn’t even had time to read up on the literature before he was rushed here, so he slowly began to rustle through the documents one by one.\n\nIn one of the dossiers, Daniel saw pictures of the thing taken a few hours ago when it had first arrived. It looked ... different. Daniel dared a glance at the thing. It was duller now, more opaque, than it was in the photos. Its “flaps” and “fins” drooped, and its entire body looked like it was being compressed and squashed against the table. It reminded him of melted ice cream. Daniel’s stomach churned and he looked back down towards the reports. He only scanned the next fifty pages. In total, the reports said nothing about it in thousands of words. It was an enigma and unlike anything else.  He was the first. He had his shot before even the scientists could get their hands on it. He didn’t know whether to feel honored or terrified. \n\nDaniel noticed a slight noise coming from the receiver on the table. Grimacing, Daniel picked up the receiver and placed it in his ear. He disliked this but it was “standard” procedure.\n\n“What do you think you’re doing?” a voice demanded.\n\nDaniel did not recognize the voice but it was filled with an arrogance that enraged him. Daniel turned his steely gaze towards one of the cameras.\n\n“I assume you’d like me to know what it is exactly that I’m doing sir. Perhaps next time you should give me more time to read th--“\n\n“Colonel Lehmann! You were sent to communicate with the threat and decide the best course of action. Now if you are incapable of this very simple task you will be relieved. Understood?”  That was the Secretary of Defense. How many bureaucrats hid in the shadows, watching with safety behind their cameras and walls? If you turned on a light would they scatter…?\n\n“Crystal,” said Daniel.\n\nHe slid his papers away, clearing the field. He looked back at the thing’s side. It seemed even duller than the last time he had looked but he couldn’t be sure. Daniel nodded to the operator and received a shaky thumbs-up.\n\nThey were good to go. “Why are you here?” Daniel inquired.\n\nThe machine began to beep as the operator quickly worked on deciphering each letter into dots and dashes. Finally the operator slumped back into his seat. He fidgeted with items near him to occupy himself until it answered--if it answered.\n\nDaniel felt the hairs on his neck rise and tasted ozone. There was a sharp crack as the operator dropped his pencil. Daniel looked around to see that the guards had raised their weapons slightly and the operator was stiff with his eyes staring straight out, staring slightly past the thing, like a deer caught in headlights. They sensed it too. The machine began to hiss with static. Then the voices began, like several people speaking at once, not fighting for air but sharing it.\n\n“We are here as messengers,” the voices said.\n\nThen the bureaucrats began. It started with disconcerted mumbling occasionally loud enough to be transmitted and then broke out into yelling and arguments. Daniel rubbed his temples. They were already at each other’s throats. Doing his best to ignore the receiver, Daniel glanced around the room admiring the unflinching guards. They held their weapons with a trained ease, confident in the superiority they provided. But in such a case as this, could they really be sure?\n\n“What do you mean by “we?” Daniel said.\n\n“Those who stand before you and those we represent.”\n\nThe thing’s--perhaps things’-- antennae gave a lazy dismissive flick. Could it really be multiple creatures?\n\n“What are you?”\n\n“There is no auditory representation of us. You may choose your own.”\n\n“How many of you are here?”\n\n“Just us.” The thing began to ripple more erratically. “We do not have time for this.”\n\nDaniel leaned forward, “What is your message?”\n\n“End all emission of electrical signals--immediately.”\n\nThe noise from the receiver broke into a roar. The bureaucrats knew exactly what was at stake. Economies would be crippled. Society and development would be flung decades back. Preventing a few people out of seven billion from using electrical signals is infeasible. Most importantly, even if it were possible, reelection after implementing such a procedure would not be.\n\n“You want us to turn off all our wireless transmissions?”\n\nThe creature … expanded. “Yes.”\n\n“We cannot.” Even with the continuous yelling, the humans listening in seemed to agree on this much. Daniel waited for the operator to transmit his message. He was slow in doing so, and his actions and responses were slurred like a man in daze.\n\nBefore the operator had transmitted the message, the static hissed from the machine again, causing the operator to nearly leap backwards into the arms of one of the guards.\n\n“Why?!”\n\nDaniel nearly flinched. His heartbeat quickened and he had to forcefully pace himself. In an effort to mask his unease he nonchalantly motioned for someone to bring him water. Daniel turned his impassive face towards the thing again with renewed hostility. \n\n “We do not trust you.” He heard the bureaucrats murmur an agreement--the stars must have been aligned. \n\nThe fins rippled and groups of voices took turns to speak, “Your emissions are a beacon, a beacon that could lead them to us or yourselves. They are close. And if they find you, they will destroy us all.”\n\n“Who are they?”\n\n“Nomads. Parasites. Conquerors. If they find you it will only be a matter of time before you reveal us. You _must_ stop”\n\n \nAdditional Info: This was originally a homework assignment. It's been long since completed and submitted and I wish to continue it for my own benefit. However, I feel like I hit a wall in the writing and can't continue. I want the encounter to end with hostility but I cannot get it to unfold in such a manner.

He could hardly wait to get out of class. Mondays, and Fridays were fine because there was a small chance of him seeing her. However, on Wednesdays she was always on time. He could see it now walking out from his this room strolling down Taylor Mall. Casually looking over to his right, and there she would be in a sunflower dress with dark hair writing in her journal. He could feel it now the sun beating down on him, and the wind tickling his skin. Jeffery would spend hours every day imagining how he would ask her to a date.  Perhaps Coffee, no she wouldn’t like coffee it’s obvious she likes tea. The courage he needed wasn’t there; he couldn’t talk to girls especially beautiful ones like her. The clock was ticking away, and the professor closed his book with a loud thud. Everyone got up, and started to leave. Jeffery was so deep into though that he didn’t hear class was over so early. Looking at the clock he knew he had time to stroll around in the building. She wouldn’t be there until 12:30. \nJeffery walked out and down the hall to his right. Ahead of him was the journalist building. He thought why not pop on by, and see what they were up to. He fixed his tie, and walked in. The building was much more impressive than the criminal justice one. Newly remolded it held three floors, and a news station on top. All of the students were moving around through the building all dressed nice, and talking about current events. College always had the optimistic feel to it especially on Wednesdays. Jeffery looked around the room. I may as well take a seat, I still have ten minutes. He sat there and opened up his favorite book, and started to read. Behind him he could hear the television blaring news programs. Another new part of the build was a massive projector showing news around the clock. Give me a good book any day. \nHe wasn’t a page in when he heard “Some of the most difficult of challenges is taking the first step.” \nJeffery turned kept listening. “We have to fight for what we want, and never take no for answer. Today may be the last day we have on earth.” Jeffery was feeling something moving inside of him, a strange inspiration. “So with this last day we will love like there is no tomorrow, fight like there is no tomorrow, and live like there is no tomorrow.” YES, Jeffery thought yes that’s right I have to tell her. He turns around to see where this new motivation comes from. On the scene is black and the words come up “Ford.” Why do car commercials always have the best inspiration? His watch started to beep he looked down 12:25. This was it he was about to see her. He got up, but the inspiration he felt still lingered with him. His breathing picked up, and he started to walk at a brisk pace. This was something different this was something new. He was going to ask her to a date today. He was actually going to talk to her. He started moving faster and faster almost running to the door. He quickly opens it. I’m going to do it I can do it. He rounds the corner to Taylor mall and stops to look for her. In his excitement he began to frantically search. She wasn’t on the grass like she normally was, or on any of the benches. He felt the need to keep looking. It was Wednesday she had to be here. There was no mistake she wasn’t here. He went over to where she normally sat a small group of people were there talking. \n“Excuse me, have you seen a pretty girl with long dark hair in a Sun Flower dress?”\nThey looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders. One of the other girls sitting there spoke up to Jeffery, “What’s her name?”\nHis face went white. In all of the time that he had been dreaming about her he never knew her name. He began to run down Taylor mall in embarrassment. He reached the edge of the street. Defeated, and broken he would get on the train back to his small dorm. Today college, and Wednesday lost their hopeful optimism.  Jeffery reached back to get his train card, and realized that his wallet was missing. Perfect as if today couldn’t get any worse. He started to head back to the journalist building where he thought he lost it. We walked in, and climbed up the stairs. He got to his couch, and saw no wallet. His heart sank again. He lost his wallet, lost hope of asking the most beautiful girl out on a date, and embarrassed himself doing it. He turned to walk home when he felt a tap on his shoulder.

In this short story I am going to describe the infamous and horrible tale of what can be only called as “the monstrosity.” \n\nThe monstrosity was born in 1945, his exact date of birth is unknown, he was born in Midwestern America; most likely Kansas. His father was a hulk of a man who conceived him when he brutally raped his own daughter, the violence in the monster’s life began before he was even born. His mother lets call her Lesly was only seventeen years old when she gave birth to the monstrosity, who was born about three weeks premature. Lesly almost died in childbirth because the monster’s father (lets call him Larry) continued to beat her during the pregnancy which led to the premature and extremely painful birth. The doctors predicted the monstrosity would not live through the night...oh how wrong they were; looking back if the doctors knew of the evil they allowed to enter the world, they may have had no problem suffocating that small innocent child right there and then. \nThe monstrosity had no serious health problems from the violent birth, except for the fact that he would never grow taller than 5'5 even as a grown man; this monster’s height comes into play later and can be looked at as a curse or a blessing depending on how you read this evil’s story. \n\nThe monster’s father Larry remarried shortly after he was born, he lied to all about the real mother of the monster. Being a minor still Lesly was forced to continue to live with Larry and his new wife Marie even after all the abuse and pain he had caused her, she wouldn't run away because she felt her son deserved a real mother not a life of lies. So, for the next three-years she worked hard at her job as a waitress to save enough money to move out of the abusive home with her son and get her own place. The abuse of Lesly continued throughout these years but Larry didn’t touch his son the monster because he respected the fact that his son had a keen likeness to himself, and resented the fact that his own daughter Lesly wanted to turn his own child against him. Larry wasn't a sociopath but he was a monster by his own merit, he didn't understand why his daughter hated him and thought he was a useless excuse for a men let alone a father; even though he sexually and physically abused her after her mother passed away from cancer when Lesly was about nine-years old. Larry tried to turn the monster who was about four years old by this point against his true mother Lesly and make him love his wife Marie and him as parents. \n\nNow, for a moment let us observe what know about Larry’s second wife Marie...she was about twenty-six years old married to Larry a much older man and little is known about her background or early-life. What we do know however straight from the words of our little monster is that she was an extremely beautiful woman; about 5’9, luscious blond hair, long legs, a nice curvy midsection, and most of all her skin according to the monster was softer than any other woman he ever met. But that all comes in to play later in this story of true evil. \nI will set the scene for the beginnings of our little monster’s first look at death and real cruelty. Of course the monster was exposed to the beatings of his real mother Lesly from time to time, but Marie did her best to keep the monster away from such things. You may be thinking why would a woman as beautiful as I described Marie as be with a violent man like Larry and allow him to abuse his adult daughter? Well, since little is known about Marie’s personality (at this point in time) I guess we can just say love works in mysterious ways and in this case ends up intertwined with death and unknowingly creating pure evil. Anyway, back to the story...Lesly finally saved up enough money to take the monster away from this hateful environment and get her own nice place. But Larry and Marie didn’t like that idea, they didn’t believe that Lesly really worked for that money and accused her of prostituting herself to make the money. They called her all sorts of names, not knowing that our little monster was hiding under the bed in his mother’s room just taking all this in. Like I said he had witnessed violence before, but never had he witnessed such abuse in a verbal sense they broke his mother down. Lesly wasn't the most emotionally sound woman due to her father’s abuse and it didn't take much to break her, and by the end of the verbal abuse from Marie and Larry which went on for almost an hour she just sat in the corner wet with her own tears and ashamed that she allowed them to do that to her. \n\nThen something happened to Lesly as she set there wallowing in her own pain and self-hate...she snapped. This young woman who received awful abuse by her own father her whole life finally snapped. She hated him with such passion, who was he to abuse her and then coddle her son like he was a decent human being when he was the one who raped her and almost killed her from beatings during her pregnancy! Lesly was not a small woman, her father Larry was about 6’6 and 250-pounds and he passed those genes onto his daughter; she was 6’3 but her weight was unknown. She grabbed Larry’s baseball bat that he used to occasionally use to beat her when he wasn't playing on the local softball team with it, and she waited in the room until she heard Marie go into her room and fall asleep. She left her room, and shortly after the monster (without her knowledge) followed her into the hallway and watched her. \n\nShe saw that Larry was passed out on the couch and she snuck up behind him, only his head was exposed from under the covers. Lesly raised the bat above her head and slammed it back down with all the might and power she had within her body. The sound of Larry’s skull cracking was sickening to the soul of a normal person...you could hear the skull break apart into small fragments and slice through the brain matter. You could taste the blood in the air and feel the lack of Larry’s existence within it. Even though our monster was only four or five years old, he describes the event with such vivid remembrance as if it was his first memory. And maybe it was, because in my opinion this moment and what happened next is what creates our little monster as he really is or will be for the rest of his so called life. \n\t\nLarry was near dead after the first blow, but Lesly didn't know that and probably felt more powerful and in control than she ever had before in her entire life. She kept hitting him over and over, she destroyed his face so completely that it would take a ton of work for the cops to identify his body without just assuming. The monster describes hearing the life leave Larry’s body but instead of like it is in film he described it as just a silence within the room as if Larry’s soul or whatever made him alive had just been removed from the area. The silence as he described it was quieter than anything he would experience for a long time after. \n\t\nThan the silence was broken by Lesly yelling at the monster “go to your room, you shouldn't see this baby.” Her voice wasn't the same though it sounded different than the mother the monster though he knew, it sounded emptier as if the love Lesly held for him had exited her. And even at five years old the monster says that he felt the difference. \n","title":"The monstrosity"},"questions":[{"question":"How is the \"monstrosity\" described in this article?","answers":[{"answer":"The \"monstrosity\" is described as a serial killer.","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer would be more informative with some description of the subject.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[null],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What terrible scene did the monster see that impacted his whole life?","answers":[{"answer":"This freak saw his mother hit his father on the head with a baseball bat and kill him.","critiques":[{"critique":"The summary should not use curse words.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is incomplete and should include the details of the scene.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null},{"question":"Would Larry come back as ghost and control the monster to be the monster the text describes?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer is implied in the text.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The question can't be answered because there's no information on whether or not Larry is a ghost.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"It is stated: \"Larry wasn’t a sociopath but he was a monster by his own merit.\"","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The question is not answered.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,null,null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null}]}}

It was strategically planted within a few miles of Disney property in the hope we'd see our share of the tourist economy. \n\nThat's where I work as a customer service supervisor. \n\nIt's a very transient place. The tourists, our team members, upper management, everyone is always arriving or departing. We have a permenent Uber lane. There are little grab and go shampoos and shaving creams at every register. A whole section of our store is dedicated to hotel-related items. We even sell sandwiches in adorable, airplane shaped boxes. Every customer you meet is heading home soon and all the employees will tell you they're \"forming an exit plan\". You'll work with a guy for 6 months and one day he's vanished. The next thing you hear is a Facebook notification - \"Loading up the car for Portland, wish me luck Orlando!\" \n\nAs a result it can be easy to stop concerning yourself with the everyday details of those around you, even co-workers you see ten or twenty times a day. No one sticks around here. \n\nCase in point, this Asian chick whose been working behind the Juice Bar for somewhere between 4 months to a year, I can never tell. It just so happens most of my day is spent in a customer service booth directly across from this Bar. At that distance, maybe 50 feet, we'd exchange simple gestures - a glance here or nod there. I can tell you very little about her. She's maybe 5'3 with Dark Brown, chin length hair pinned up into a crayola orange beanie and covered neck to knees in an over-sized, white chefs coat. That's about it. One of the few other things I'd noticed was a handwritten name tag reading, \"Bok Choy\" in black permenent marker. \n\nI'll mention that this isn't so strange a thing to see on a name tag at Whole Foods Market. We have a store manager whom we regard as \"Juice\" because he's a 6'9 hipster with a bright orange Slayer beard. On any given day his name tag might say \"Juice\", \"The Juice\" or \"Juiced\". There's also a few hippies from the holistic team who renamed themselves after their astrological sign. A person's name tag can say literally anything here. \n\nThis day I decided to order a Juice, which is unusual for me. Approaching the register, I say, a bit loudly, \"Hey, Bok Choy, what's up?\". \n\nA cold stare came back in my direction. \n\n\"My name is Melanie. Seriously, Jason? I'm wearing a name tag and everything.\" \n\nI put a stupid look on my face and pointed at her chest. As I'm dropping my finger arrogantly towards the tag it finally hits me - the tag says \"Favorite Vegetable\". Not name, but \"Favorite Vegetable\".

Notify me when available\" button where the peach \"Add to bag\" button briefly was. According to the Peach & Lily team, what made so many people jump at the chance to buy it is that it's so good at \"de-gunking\" skin through gentle resurfacing. In fact, Peach & Lily founder Alicia Yoon, who suffers from eczema, says this is the first chemical peel gentle enough for her to use.\n\nAnd it probably didn't hurt that Peach & Lily's Instagram account posted a video right before the launch featuring a video of the mask gleaming in its jar. It's truly hypnotizing.\n\nIf you've got your heart set on snagging a Super Reboot Resurfacing Mask for yourself, don't worry — Peach & Lily is working on getting it back in stock, and you can be one of the first to know of its triumphant return by clicking on the aforementioned \"notify me\" button.\n\nUPDATE (JULY 16, 2018): After nearly two months, the wait is finally over: Peach & Lily's in-house skin-care collection, announced in late May, makes its official debut today. And while it may be small, the demand for the line is expected to be mighty, considering two of the products already flew off virtual, pre-sale shelves.\n\nThose two already-popular products are collection's hero formula, Glass Skin Refining Serum, and the Original Glow Sheet Mask, which sold out on both peachandlily.com and QVC.\n\nPeach & Lily is also launching the Super Reboot Resurfacing Mask, a wash-off formula that gently exfoliates; Matcha Pudding Antioxidant Cream, a free-radical-fighting moisturizer, and Pure Beam Luxe Oil, which provides fatty acids and antioxidants to reinforce skin's protective barrier. Each product in the collection averages about $40, except for the Original Glow Sheet Mask, which is available individually for $6 and in a set of 20 for $79.\n\nIn addition to its promise of effectiveness, the Peach & Lily skin-care collection has also sworn off many of the ingredients that turn shoppers off, including animal fats, detergents, mineral oil, parabens, petrolatum, phthalates, and synthetic fragrances.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_This post originally appeared on May 24, 2018:_\n\nKorean beauty retailer Peach & Lily has established itself as one of the must-shop websites for emerging and beloved K-beauty brands like Saturday Skin, Femmue, and Mizon. With the exception of its CVS collaboration, Peach Slices, however, the company hadn't ventured into making its own products. Until now, that is.\n\nThe brand posted three simple videos to Instagram announcing the arrival of Peach & Lily's very own skin-care collection, starting with a serum. \"🎉✨WE’RE OVER THE MOON EXCITED✨🎉 Introducing...Peach & Lily skincare! ✨🎉\" the caption of the first video reads. \"We’ve been quietly developing this dreamy line for you for two years. We set out to create a skincare line that gives you everything: proven results, clean and safe formulas, fresh ingredients, decadent textures. Results, delight and safety. 💫 We launched our site seven years ago without fanfare or a big party, instead we launched with the most important thing in focus: connecting with you. It only felt right to share about this launch — our most passionate endeavor yet at Peach & Lily - the same way we did on day one. An earnest, pared-down message that keeps you in the focal point, always.\"\n\nThe caption goes on to say that the full collection will launch in the summer, but the second video's caption announced a pre-sale for the very first product, called Glass Skin Refining Serum. \"A breakthrough formula that delivers translucent, poreless, radiant, refined skin. That elusive glass skin is now yours.\" Well, it's not yours _yet_. The $39 serum — called a \"revolutionary cocktail of peach extract, niacinamide, East Asian mountain yam, madecassoside, peptides, and hyaluronic acid\" in its description — is already sold out. However, you do have the option of being notified when orders are being taken again.\n\nA third video encourages fans to follow Peach & Lily founder Alicia Yoon for a behind-the-scenes look at product development and insight into how the collection started. She shares some of those details on peachandlily.com, explaining her research began two years ago when her sister told her she was pregnant.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about Peach & Lily products for men?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The answer should mention that the text does not mention anything about a men's line.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"The answer should mention that the text does not mention any products for men.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[0,0],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":false,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What does the text say about the Super Reboot Resurfacing Mask?","answers":[{"answer":"The Super Reboot Resurfacing Mask is one of the five new products in Peach & Lily's in-house skin-care collection.

He had a look of anticipation, as if he was waiting for some pain relieving gossip. \n\n“I was home,” I responded innocently before he rolled his eyes at me. “Now, don’t bother me, I’m trying to focus.” Although normally I would use anything to distract me from school, I wasn’t about to involve Max in last night’s mess.\n\n“Are you expecting me to believe you weren’t at Nina’s party?” He raised his eyebrows at me. I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me. Perhaps I couldn’t fix her parent’s divorce, but I could at least attend her house party. Especially after her break up with Todd, the leather jacket douche that called her “babe” so much I would wonder if he knew her real name.\n\n“I promise you’ll have a great time,” Nina had told me. And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle. Something nostalgic about repetitive rap songs preaching about the wonders of big asses. \n\nEverything seemed normal at first. The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room. I could feel the air thickening. \n\nMinutes before terror, I was standing unnoticed next to a group of girls I recognized. \n\n“Someone told me her dad was abusive,” I heard one say with wide eyes. \n\n“Yeah, apparently the neighbors called the cops on them,” another responded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t point fingers just yet. Nina’s mom’s a bitch. Maybe she deserved it,” a brunette shrugged and took a sip of her drink right before our eyes met. Her face flared red as she realized her words had been overhead. I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry. A millisecond later, I spotted Nina on the floor. Hands covering her face in defense. The lack of light in the room didn’t stop the fierceness of her blood as it dripped down her temple and into her hair. \n\nI stood still. My brain called in fear but my body made no response. Not even when Todd walked passed me, into the hallway and shut the door behind him. \n\nNina remained on the floor. She held herself and rocked back and forth, letting silent cries out into the thick air. \n\n“Don’t tell anyone.” She whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” Max snapped at me. “Are you going to tell me or not?” I stared at him blankly as the vivid flashbacks flew through my head. My heart stung in bitterness as I recognized that all I wanted to do was say it.

PHD.\n\nDated March 14th 2035\n\nNoted location: \"Old World,\" State-run Hospital VA-02295 \"St. Francine's\"\n\n...\n  As I read the chart I noticed the results of the State mandated Gen-PreF tests. It reported that my next patient couple was decidedly more comfortable with a \"male\" doctor. I was disappointed. I thought about how I would have to announce myself as \"Mystr S., PHD.\" It just didn't roll of the tongue as well as \"Miss\" did, or even the more simple \"Dr. S.\" and leave my gender neutral. I wasn't worried about passing off as a man though, I had just visited the barb-ilist. The thym that worked on me did a wonderful job, not too long, not too short. The perfect blend of \"long-haired man\" or \"not too short-haired woman.\" My other traits have all been sculpted to be \"visual kei.\" I still, to this day, swear the hip shrinking pelvis shaving surgery was far more painful than my breast reduction, counter to the common claims of my peers. The State supplied hormone pills took care of everything else.\n  \n  When I stepped into the room I took a quick measure of the persons in front of me. The \"male\" was decidedly trying to be neutral, but his haggard complexion and signs of stubble on his face, gave me the impression of \"him\" more than anything. I allowed him the improper variance given the womyn in the room. \"She\" was nervous, her eyes darted down from him to me as I walked in. She was several weeks pregnant, and starting to show.\n  \n  \"Hello, Miss J. and Mystr K., my name is Docto- I mean Mystr S., PHD,\" I said, slipping.\n  \n  The man narrowed his eyes and looked me up and down, but kept his mouth shut. She was in a sitting position in the chair in the middle of the room, he was standing over her left shoulder, his hand on it.\n  \n  \"I've been reading your chart, here... no family names?\" I asked conversationally.\n  \n  The womyn looked up at him and squeezed his hand as he cringed, \"I don't have a family.\"\n  \n  She looked back down to me and said, \"I used to have a family name, but I went through a deerkin phase and had it legally changed. After I met K. here I changed it back to my given name but kept out my family name for hym.\" I noticed the inflection when she said \"hym.\" Keeping up appearances I assumed. It was well enough, because I did have the power to incite sanctions against them for not keeping to the rules of neutrality.\n  \n  \"Ah, so J and K it is then. Not Myssus hmm? You aren't legal life partners yet?\" I quizzed sitting down in the swivel chair provided for me.\n  \n  The man stood taller and said almost monotonously, \"No, but we have cohabited for two and a half years now.\" \n  \n  This response was acceptable, since the State funded OCare that was paying for this visit only allowed them to be here if they met certain criteria. Marriage is no longer a legal coupling, one of the few concessions the retro-conservs won from the peace talks after The Gender Wars, but cohabitation for a period longer than two years was. \n  \n  What I found most interesting was their nervousness in using the State funded care. Nearly everyone did now, and since the demand was so low, non-funded health care was pretty cheap. Heck, with nearly everything provided to me at my andro housing barracks, my stipend of 'fun' expenditures could easily afford the cost of a legally enforced gender checkup during pregnancy. Not that I would ever get pregnant, disgusting. Genetic tailoring and the use of synthetic wombs is such a cleaner option.\n  \n  \"Very good. Let's take a look at your fetus shall we then?\" I said as I down the chart, grabbed some latex gloves from the counter, wheeled closer, and pulled the ultrasound caddy closer.\n  \n  Everything checked out okay, with one exception. \"Healthy, but sorry, it's a boy.

Following this, he undertook a media course run by Community Service Volunteers in South East London where he was given the opportunity to begin broadcasting a music show from Radio Thamesmead (now RTM.FM). His show ‘Sharp As A Needle’ was named after the Barmy Army track of the same name was broadcast weekly across London and Kent.[3]\n\nIn 1991, Kennedy met Sammy Jacobs, a former pirate broadcaster and radio controller at Reading and Leeds FestivalsReading Festival, who had just obtained a restricted service license to operate XFM radio station. After taking on a slot within the Reading Festival Radio Presenter Team, Kennedy was hired by Jacobs for his new channel, XFM (now Radio X).\n\nRadio X gained its FM licence and became full time on 1 September 1997 with Kennedy's first broadcast following in 1999. Kennedy is the only member of the current presenting team who has been with the station continuously throughout its years and hosts its longest-running specialist show.\n\nX-Posure\n\nKennedy is the presenter of the new music show _X-Posure_ on Radio X, currently broadcasting on Friday and Saturday nights from 11pm to 2pm.[4] The show introduces music from up-and-coming artists primarily, although not exclusively, from alternative and indie styles, and regularly includes live sessions and interviews.\n\nOver the years the show has featured a huge range of artists and Kennedy has been credited with discovering countless musicians who have gone on to find success, including the likes of Adele, The xx, Razorlight, Kate Nash, The Ting Tings, The Futureheads, Dan Le Sac Vs Scroobius Pip and Mumford & Sons.[5] The _Independent_ described the show as one of the “most eclectic...on British radio”.[6]\n\nCompere\n\nAs well as filling sixteen hours of airtime with new music each week, Kennedy supports new talent with regular X-Posure music nights across London, often taking place at Ben Lovett’s (Mumford and Sons) venue Omera. The nights showcase artists in the same vein as his radio show.\n\nIn 2016, Kennedy hosted and curated the X-Posure All Dayer, an eight-hour event featuring up to ten up and coming bands at The Camden Barfly in North West London.[7] To celebrate 20 years of _X-Posure_ Kennedy hosted another all-day gig, the X-Posure Summer Party. The event made use of Flat Iron Square’s three on-site venues, The Omera, The Outdoor Garden Stage and Apres, and featured artists including Mystery Jets, Temples, Babeheaven and APRE as well as DJ sets from Kennedy as well as fellow Radio X presenter Jack Wood.[8]\n\nFrom 2009 to 2016 Kennedy compered the Quarry Stage and the Laurel Lounge at In The Woods Festival in Kent, a festival promoting the discovery of artists. Since 2017 Kennedy has hosted the latest output from In The Woods, the music production podcast Tape Notes.[9][10]\n\nPodcasts\n\nKennedy is the host of the podcast Tape Notes, a music production podcast in which artists are reunited with producers to discuss their work together in the studio. Their conversations delve into every stage of the creative process, from the first spark of a song idea, through decisions on instrumentation and style, to finessing the final product. The conversations also feature early demo versions and stems from the original recording sessions.[11] The range of artists featured on Tape Notes includes the likes of Alt-J, The 1975, London Grammar and Kate Tempest as well as producers Dan Carey, Jim Abbiss, Simone Felice and Charlie Andrew.[12]\n\nAmong these, Kennedy has hosted two live episodes of Tape Notes, one at Latitude Festival with the alternative band Easy Life and producer Rob Milton, as well as an event at Miloco Studios with the duo Ibeyi and producer Richard Russell in celebration of National Album Day.[13]\n\nJournalism\n\nTowards the start of his career, Kennedy wrote a regular column for British magazine _Dazed & Confused_[14] (now _Dazed_)\n\n\nAwards\n\nKennedy was awarded the _Time Out_ Live Award 2005/06 for his live DJ performances and gig curations as part of various X-Posure events.\n\nIn 2012, he was presented with the XFM Inspiration Award by Mumford & Sons as part of the radio station’s Winter Wonderland event. Before John was presented with the award video messages from artists including Elbow, Paul Weller and The Maccabees were shown.[15]\n\nIn 2016 Kennedy became the first-ever recipient of the Arqiva Commercial Radio Music Champion Award in recognition for his dedication to new and independent artists, dating back to the days of Radio X's predecessor XFM in the 1990s.[16]\n\nKennedy has been heavily involved with the Mercury Prize, the annual music prize awarded for the best album released in the United Kingdom, and has been a regular member of the judging panel since 2009.[17]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] \n\n[13] \n\n[14] \n\n[15] \n\n[16] \n\n[17] \n","title":"John Kennedy (radio broadcaster)"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about John Kennedy's early radio career?","answers":[{"answer":"John Kennedy worked as a disc jockey regularly holding club nights while studying at University in Norwich.

It has been months of hectic work, and she was finally happy to go home and relax. As she drove down the familiar route, her mind went on a journey of its own – down the memory lane. All her childhood years, all the events that made her the woman she was today, flashed before her eyes.\r\n\nAs she reveled in the memories, the flashing lights and wailing sirens pulled her from dreamland back into reality.\r\n\n“What the hell” she spoke to herself. “I wasn’t speeding”\r\n\nShe was ready to give the officer a piece of her mind, when she realized that the car wasn’t after her. It was probably transported a convict to the prison, just a few miles down the road. She remembered how that prison was a curse on her hometown. Prisoners escaped all the time and their closest target would be her town. She glared at the prison as she drove past it.\r\n\nShe turned on the radio to take her mind off things. Music always made her feel better. Just as she crossed a signpost that said she was five miles from her destination, she saw a guy sticking out his thumb. He was muscular, and dressed in formals. He looked like he was probably in his early thirties. Amanda stopped the car, and rolled down the window.\r\n\n“Hello there! I’m Joseph. My car broke down, and I need a ride. Would you be so kind to give me a lift?”\r\n\n“Sure Joseph, hop in. I’m Amanda, by the way.” \r\n\nAmanda liked picking up hitchhikers. She was always happy to have them in her car.\r\n\n“So Joseph, where are you headed?”\r\n\n“Vacation. I have a cabin around here. Just a mile before River Heights. We’re vacationing there for the weekend”\r\n\n“Who’s ‘we’?” Amanda was curious.\r\n\n“Me, my wife, and our kids. We wanted to go somewhere peaceful, and where be--”\r\n\n“--better than River Heights?” She finished his line for him. “I was born and raised here. Welcome to our town, Joseph”\r\n\n“Oh. You’re a native. My mother was from River Heights, so the place is always special to me”\r\n\nThey continued exchanging stories, as the car approached a small path that broke off the highway.\r\n\n“That’s the way to the cabin” Joseph said, sounding excited.\r\n\nAs they drove down the dark path, an unsettling feeling came over Amanda. But she kept driving, as the path suddenly ended in the middle of a forest.\r\n“Umm... Joseph? Where’s the cabin you--” A sharp blow to her face stopped the sentence in half.\r\nJoseph got out of the car, pulled Amanda out, and shoved her on the ground. She tried getting up, only to get hit again.\r\n\n“You know Amanda” he said, ripping off her shirt. “Picking hitchhikers around a prison is a foolish thing to do. They might turn out to be a killer. Lucky for you, I’m merely a rapi--”\r\n\nHe froze, as he felt a cold intrusion in his chest. He looked down to see blood dripping down the slit between his ribs. Amanda shoved him off and stood over him, with her favourite knife covered in his blood.\r\n\n“Speaking of foolish things, you should never get in a stranger’s car, especially a stranger who grew up around a prison”, she said with a maniacal smile in her face. “Like you said, they might turn out to be a killer”\r\n\nJoseph gasped, as the cold knife proceeded to taste more of his blood.

This prompted an obvious question: Would Republicans put their money where their mouth is and actually use their power to punish Trump?\n\nWell, House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked that question at Tuesday presser — and he made it clear the answer was no, at least as far as the GOP leadership was concerned.\n\nHere’s the key exchange between Ryan and a reporter:\n\n  RYAN: I understand the desire and the need to have good relations. That’s perfectly reasonable. But Russia is a menacing government that does not share our interests and does not share our values. And I think that should be made very, very clear.\n\n  REPORTER: What could you do? You guys are a co-equal branch of government. What could you do to make sure he [Trump] doesn’t do something ...\n\n  RYAN: Here’s what we can do, and here’s what we have already done — which is to put sanctions on Russia. ... We’d already put in place sanctions. If the [House] Foreign Affairs Committee or the Financial Service Committee — or the Senate Banking Committee — think that there are other sanctions that we have not yet put in place on Russia, I’m more than happy to consider those.\n\nNote how weaselly Ryan’s answer is. The question wasn’t, “What are you doing to punish Russia?” It was, “How can you constrain Trump from cozying up even more to Putin?” That isn’t a problem that can be solved by new sanctions. It would require passing legislation that puts limits on the president’s power to change US policy on a whole host of foreign policy issues (like Ukraine or Syria), or block Trump from firing special counsel Robert Mueller and ending the Russia collusion probe.\n\nBut doing something like that would, of course, provoke a major fight with Trump. Ryan is so unwilling to do that he won’t even think about proposing such measures. Instead, he moves to the safer ground of hypothetical new Russia sanctions that may never actually emerge and that wouldn’t really constrain Trump from changing US policy on Russia.\n\nThis speaks to a vital point about the GOP’s “backlash” against the Putin meeting. Ultimately, congressional Republicans mostly care more about staying in Trump’s good graces — and avoiding a fight that could jeopardize their legislative agenda and anger the pro-Trump base before the upcoming midterm elections — than about the ways that Trump is taking a hammer to decades of US foreign policy on Russia and other issues.\n\nRepublicans in Congress simply place a higher value on party unity than on the foreign policy principles they claim to stand for. If they didn’t, Ryan would actually be talking about new laws to constrain Trump.\n\nThat isn’t a value judgment, or even necessarily a criticism. There’s a case, from the Republican point of view, for refusing to cross Trump even when he tramples on years of conservative orthodoxy.\n\nBut Ryan isn’t making that case. He, and the rest of the mainstream GOP, is trying desperately to pretend that you can be anti-Putin and pro-Trump. But Monday’s presser made it clear that’s impossible.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWILL YOU HELP KEEP VOX FREE FOR ALL?\n\nThere is tremendous power in understanding.

There weren't any children playing, no mother tending to their young; there was nothing captivating about it. However, I still remember how green the grass was, the laughter of the children, soccer moms walking their dogs, but mostly, I remember her. Her green eyes, her elegance, and the way her hips swayed to and fro when she walked. The way her long black hair would look when the wind picked up and the way I laughed whenever she dropped something. \n\nEvery day at 10 a.m., I would see her perched on the park bench reading a book or a magazine of some sort. She'd sit there for about an hour or two, and then she would leave without anyone turning their heads but mine. It was as if I was that creepy kid in your math class who'd always stare at you whenever you got up to sharpen your pencil. My eyes were locked onto her and disappointment would wash over me whenever I lost sight.  \n\nThis routine continued for many months, and she hadn't noticed me for I had said not a single word. I was never going to, because I didn't want to ruin the perfect image I had of her. It was better to admire from afar. Better to be unseen than noticed I thought. But some nights I'd wish I said something to her, just one word like hi. Still I didn't. It was my fear of rejection and what is she thought I was weird or creepy? What if she noticed I stared at her? All of these questions running through my mind and I could've said something, but I didn't.\n\nOn those I walked back to my place to think. Once I got home, the pungent smell of cigarettes filled up my nostrils and for some odd reason, everything seemed pointless:  My life, my career as a writer, my love life, evens my cat's life. So, I just began to wallow in my self-pity until I fell asleep. It's better if I don't go tomorrow I thought to myself. I lacked the gumption to ever talk to her so why should I go? But that night I had a dream that she spoke to me - she sounded beautiful - and that's all I remember. I woke up and jumped out of bed, took a shower, and put on my best dress. Then, I continued to run to the park maybe the dream was a sign that she was going to be mine. I bumped into people. I might’ve bumped into an old lady, but I didn’t care. \nAfter 20 minutes of people yelling at me and frantic running, I arrived at the park just after 10 a.m., and I saw her - she was the first person I noticed, but she wasn't alone.  She was with a man - most likely her husband - and two children. They all looked happy - no troubles in the world. It was a bittersweet moment because she looked so happy when I have always seen her look so forlorn. After standing there for two minutes, I walked away and at that moment, I felt my whole world fall apart - piece by piece.\n\nOn my walk home I wondered if there was any animosity brewing between them – maybe he cheated and she secretly hates him, or maybe they just look happy and they’re planning to get a divorce. An overwhelming sense of false hope came and went away when I knew all of it wasn’t true. She’ll be there tomorrow I thought. I know she will.\n\nAfter that I never saw her again - she never sat on her bench or read a book or a magazine of some sort. I felt empty inside without the sight of her. And day after day I waited for her to come back. She never did and I came to terms with it. She wasn't coming I shouldn't worry if she ever does, but an emptiness still lingered in my heart. Then I had another dream that was edifying. \n\nIn my dream, I desperately looked for her, hoping to fill the emptiness in my heart, she had to be there. I finally noticed her, stunned by how beautiful she looked. She had a little black dress on with shoes that complemented it so very well. She had red lipstick on and she did her hair in a perfect little bun. Oh, how I wish you could've seen her. She looked beautiful. Then, she said, \"it's only life, darling,\" then she leans in and plants a kiss on my lips. She was gone. I never dreamt of her again. She was out of my life; out of my head.\n","title":"RF (Second short short, please leave suggestion on what I can do to improve)"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story say about how the narrator became a writer?","answers":[{"answer":"No answer","critiques":[{"critique":"The narrator became a writer because they were a writer.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The narrator does talk about her love life, which is the subject matter of a writer, even if the approach is just the stories of their love life.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"The answer is empty.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"No answer is provided.","feedback":{"helpful":true}},{"critique":"No answer.","feedback":{"helpful":true}}]}],"rankings":[null,null,1,1,1],"is_critiqueable":null,"has_better_critique":true,"new_critique":{"text":"The answer should state that the story does not say how the narrator became a writer.","category":"coherence","severity":2,"category_text":""}},{"question":"What does the story say about the narrator's inability to approach and talk to the girl in the park?","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator is unable to approach and talk to the girl in the park because he fears that she would think he is creepy or weird.

He did not acknowledge the fact that explicit ratings systems for movies and video games have existed for decades.\n\n“We have to look at the Internet, because a lot of bad things are happening to young kids and young minds, and their minds are being formed. And we have to do something about maybe what they’re seeing and how they’re seeing it,” Trump said. “And also video games. I’m hearing more and more people say the level of violence in video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts. And then you go the further step and that’s the movies. You see these movies, they’re so violent and yet a kid is able to see a movie if sex isn’t involved, but killing is involved. Maybe they have to put a rating system for that.”\n\nAttorney General JEFF SESSIONS, Health and Human Services Secretary ALEX AZAR, Domestic Policy Council Director ANDREW BREMBERG, White House Chief of Staff JOHN KELLY, Secretary of Education BETSY DEVOS, and adviser KELLYANNE CONWAY also attended the meeting Thursday, in addition to local officials.\n\nHis puzzling call for a ratings system aside, Trump echoed a common debate that is often stirred up after mass school shootings, one that places the blame on pop culture. As _T.H.R._ points out, he’s far from the first politician to voice concerns over violent video games. In the past week, Republican Kentucky Governor MATT BEVIN and Republican Rhode Island Representative ROBERT “BOBBY” NARDOLILLO mentioned video games, with the latter proposing a tax on games rated “M” for mature or above. (Because, again: the games already get ratings based on their violent content.) Back in 2005, even HILLARY CLINTON spoke out against increasingly violent games, saying they are “stealing the innocence from our children” and should be monitored like “tobacco, alcohol, and pornography.”\n\nThe vocal students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where the Parkland shooting occurred, do not agree. Rather than blaming violent video games and films, they have instead made waves by calling out inactive politicians and the N.R.A. In a stirring Wednesday night town hall meeting hosted by CNN, the students—as well as parents, teachers, and other locals—took Senator MARCO RUBIO and N.R.A. spokeswoman DANA LOESCH to task, demanding gun-control reform. FRED GUTTENBERG, whose daughter Jamie was killed in the shooting, told Rubio outright that both his comments, as well as Trump’s comments, have been “pathetically weak.”\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAllison Janney’s 2017-2018 Awards-Season Style\n\n-   [Image may contain Allison Janney Premiere Fashion Red Carpet Red Carpet Premiere Human and Person]\n\n-   [Image may contain Furniture Human Person Clothing Apparel Evening Dress Robe Fashion Gown Lamp and Table Lamp]\n\n-   [Image may contain Human Person Fashion Premiere Clothing Apparel and Allison Janney]\n\nBy Kevin Mazur/Getty Images.\n\nMarch 3: At the Film Independent Spirit Awards\n\nWearing custom Pamella Roland.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the text say about the opinions of the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School?","answers":[{"answer":"According to the students, Donald Trump's opinion - that violent movies and video games may also be causes of school shootings - is incorrect.

His head hung low against the rain, joints aching and lungs burning from the cold air, he walks on under the gaze of the silent marble guardians that stand all around.  They are placed in concentric ranks, evenly spaced and facing inwards, ever vigilant. There are thousands of them; tens of thousands even, covering an area miles wide. They are spaced evenly throughout their rings with a gap just wide enough for two people to slip in between with twice that distance between each layer. Small engraved platinum plaques rest at the base of each, meticulously produced and maintained. \n\n\nAt the center is an open space dominated by a large sphere which floats reverently above the ground. The Earth in all its glory, with its greens, blues, and browns – meticulously detailed. White clouds swirl and dance in real time in a never ending show that matches reality. If an observer looks closely, they see small ripples throughout the vast blue oceans as the moon engages in its eternal struggle with the tides. Yellow points of civilization dot the night side, ever struggling against the darkness which creeps steadily west. Giant black scars and craters run along its surface, an eternal reminder of events not long passed.  \n\n\nOnce in awhile the old man sees another like himself, walking solemnly through this holiest of places. He places a hand onto the cold stone of a statue to steady himself as a strong gust smashes into his fragile frame. He pulls back his hand as if bitten, a numbness spreading throughout his soul. As he continues forward he looks into the faces around him even as the rain soaks his face. He doesn’t notice as it slips down his coat, and doesn’t care as the cold steals the feeling from his skin. He is beyond knowing discomfort. It has been many months since he felt. \n\n\nEach face is alive with hand crafted detail down to the very pores of the shining stone skin. Their expressions are serious yet hopeful, sad but inspiring. They stand life sized and uniformed, medals and ribbons adorning their chests. Over each stone heart is a small pin with the shape and detail of the Earth. Had they not been made of lifeless stone, each likeness could be mistaken for a living being. They are the holiest relics of the human race, in a place that has become a religious site that has no priests and belongs to no church. They stand at attention in eternal watch over the planet in their midst and the pilgrims who walk through their home.\n\n\nAs the old man draws nearer to his destination he slows his all ready careful pace to the barest of movements. He has entered the space of his nightmares, the place he visits each night in sleep and each day in life. It is a familiar place, one he has navigated through hundreds of times in the few short months since its completion. It has become routine in a sense. His path is always the same; the same stones, the same steps, the same faces, the same emptiness. \n\n\nHe stops at each monument and memorizes every face before reading the plaque under it. Each one is long since engraved in his mind. They are his link to the past, to better times before.  Some of the names he knows from the old letters. They are his most cherished possessions and the only thing of value he has. He falls asleep each night with a stack of them in his bed, only escaping into the embrace of sleep when he is too tired to remain awake any longer. \n\n\nAfter a time that may have been as long as hours or as short as minutes, the old man arrives at what has become both his hell and his salvation. It is a statue of a young woman, so perfectly detailed that the sight of it tears through his soul. He stares at her face and struggles to look away. The plaque at her feet tells only the barest of stories; that she was an officer; that she served all of humanity; that she died protecting her home. That she will be forever remembered. She has a face the old man is intimately familiar with. Her name is the same as his. \n\n\nHe remembers how it all started. How smart and happy and full of life she was. How she glowed and seemed to brighten a room just by being present. How he always pushed her to strive for more, to live up to her full potential. How he had wanted a better life for her than he had ever had for himself. How she had applied on an off chance and been accepted into the program, and how she had gone with his blessing and his encouragement. How she had written every day after she left, and how utterly proud he was. How she was his only child. \n\n\nHe remembers too how it all ended. How the Earth had been decimated. How she had been called up. He watched the live video as it all unfolded, remembers how three billion voices screamed as one when they were victorious. He remembers how none of those thousands of Earth’s children who had left ever came back. He remembers the guilt and the pain so heavy it crushed the air from his lungs. \n\n\nAmidst the howling wind, he trembles violently and falls to his knees.

Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV225-230). However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of _Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden_, BWV 230, one of the “six”.\n\nA single CD has the capacity to contain the set of six motets plus some other works. For example, Maasaki Suzuki's 2009 recording with the Bach Collegium Japan on BIS includes _O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht_, BWV 118 (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and _Ich lasse dich nicht_, BWV Anh. 159 (the authorship of which has been disputed).[1] The motets chosen for a particular recording project can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of particular work: given Bach's status as one of the great composers, a firm attribution to him is likely to result in more interest in recording the piece in question. For example, was not included by John Eliot Gardiner and the Monteverdi Choir in their first set recorded in 1980. However, they included it in their 2011 recording,[2] by which time scholarly opinion had re-assessed the work.\n\nRecordings have also been made of the less securely attributed and even spurious motets. For example, Wolfgang Helbich recorded _The Apocryphal Bach Motets_, sung by the Alsfelder Vokalensemble, in 1993 (released in 1994, re-issued 2014).[3][4]\n\n\nTypes of choirs\n\nChoirs with one voice per part (OVPP) are used in some historically informed performances of Bach. However, OVPP recordings of the motets are in the minority. Exceptions include the Hilliard Ensemble's second set,[5] and Konrad Junghänel with the group Cantus Cölln.[6] Philippe Herreweghe's second set uses OVPP for some motets, for example _Jesus meine Freude_, and not others.[7]\n\nAt least some of the motets would have been first performed by singers from Leipzig's Thomanerchor, which comprises boys and young men. This choir has recorded the motets (initially under Günther Ramin in the 1950s),[8] as have other choirs with boys' voices such as the Choir of New College, Oxford.[9]\n\n\nInstrumental accompaniment\n\nMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used. There are three possible approaches:\n\n-   _a cappella_, that is, without an accompaniment\n-   instruments doubling the vocal lines, something which is described as playing _colla parte_\n-   Basso continuo, or just an organ accompaniment, to provide some instrumental support for the singers\n\nSurviving sources do not make it clear what Bach's approach was to the accompaniment of most of these pieces. In the case of _Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf_, BWV 226 orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings and choir II by reeds (two oboes, taille and bassoon). There is also a basso continuo provided (separate violone and organ parts) which underlies both choirs.[10] An accompaniment is also specified for _Lobet den Herrn_.[11]\n\nLa Petite Bande and Bach Collegium Japan, for example, use the orchestration of _Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf_ for the other pieces for double choir. However, _a capella_ performance is long-established tradition,[12] which is also reflected in recordings. The Hilliard Ensemble's OVPP version is mainly _a capella_. They omit the instrumental parts of _Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf_, but sing _Lobet den Herrn_ to organ accompaniment.[13]\n\nThe recordings with continuo accompaniment include The Sixteen's version (the instruments are cello, violone, theorbo, organ) and the second recording by the Monteverdi Choir (cello, double bass, bassoon and organ).[14]\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe first of the motets to be recorded was _Jesu meine Freude_ in 1927. This version was sung in English.[15]\n\n\nAwards\n\nIn 2010, Suzuki and his ensemble were given a French award (Diapason d’Or de l’Année) and a German award (Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik) for their recording of Bach motets on BIS.\n\nJohn Eliot Gardiner, who has won more Gramophone Awards than any other living artist, received one for his second recording of the motets with the Monteverdi Choir on SDG. It was one of the 2013 awards, the category being “Baroque Vocal”.\n\nGrete Pedersen with the Norwegian choir Det Norske Solistkor won a Diapason d'Or in 2018 for their recording of the motets on BIS.\n\n\nDiscography\n\nThe intention has been to feature versions which are still available.

Savage in his book, \"The Millennial Project\". By no means am I claiming his works as my own. I respect his creation and wanted to incorporate this part of it into my ongoing tale.)\n\n\nA public works project had begun in Tanzania on Mt. Kilimanjaro. To the press it had been dubbed a water and energy reclamation experiment, and to the water impoverished nations of Africa they didn't question it too loudly. Why question something that would bring thousands of jobs and clean water to the stricken center of the continent, and let's not forget millions, (perhaps billions if you could really dig into the books and ferret out all the nickels and dimes) of dollars of industry? On the surface, the construct did exactly what it said. There were no lies told. The engineers had built vast sluices to harness and channel the melt from the heavy snows that had been steadily increasing at the peak of the volcano. \"This increase in snowfall was an effect of the changing climate brought about by human influence on global temperatures\", a few interest groups were shouting at the top of their lungs, \"and we should be devoting energies to stem the changes and not just blindly take advantage of them!\" They shouted, but no one was listening. Besides, the extra snowfall handled and distributed by what became known as the Kilimanjaro Resource Reclamation Project jointly managed by the central African countries, the US, and after a fashion, the UK, revitalized one of the most impoverished areas on Earth. \n\nThe three gargantuan sluices were evenly distributed around the circumference on the mountain's even-sloped rise, and from there each of the three bases branched out to smaller and smaller distribution channels like tree roots, (but moving water in the opposite direction) to the surrounding areas. Using the support pylons for the sluices as foundations, massive turbines were constructed creating wind farms, some classic propeller driven, a few using a new air-compressed turbine technology. With these farms, vast amounts of energy was produced and distributed along the water pipelines. With one well engineered stroke, the project cured much of the strife in Africa bringing water, energy, jobs, and outside interest to the nations. That outside interest being tourism of course, the universal income maker. With the violent rebellions dying down, and much of the varied countries slowly but surely working their way through peace talks and economic summits, the central African countries became a new and fresh tourist destination, bringing even more money to the table.\n\nIt was quite a generous act from the First World, again, on the surface. But, does it really matter after that? With all of the good the project had brought to millions of people, did the underlying reasons detract from the gesture? Much of the grand gestures in history had one hand giving and the other taking, and sometimes the price of what was taken was monumental and horrific. From where I sit here in the Salt Flats, I wonder.\n\nYou see, two of the sluices were just that: water collectors. They were labeled the  Kilimanjaro First and Second Arms respectively, or K1A and K2A. The third, which happened to be built directly parallel to the equator, was much larger than the other two, (and had an exponentially larger amount of security than the other two), housed a secret. There was indeed a water reclamation facility built there, (there were no overt lies spoken, remember), it just had one more pathway built into it that was never meant to be touched by water,\nAnd just a small fraction of the energy created by the wind farms were diverted to this facility to power it. Knowing that the facility would eventually have to be revealed, the right amount of money had been exchanged to the right hands, (certain heads of the African nations, and as always, the press) to keep the project quiet, but be a loud and positive supporter when the time came for the unveiling.\n\nHoused under this third arm was a thirty mile long set of rails. There was a subtle opening at the peak of the mountain that was the exit for the projected launch vehicle. The passage was essentially a gun, a \"rail gun\" apparatus first imagined by French inventor Louis Octave Fauchon-Villeplee in 1918.  It was a device that, using two parallel conductive rails that were fed an electromagnetic current in a pulse traveling the length of the barrel, could accelerate an object at extremely high velocity, no chemical propellant required.\n\nThe setting of Kilimanjaro had been ideal for a couple of reasons: the long slope stretching up from the flat plain was a perfect platform to build the rail, and it's closeness to the equator. The long slope allowed for minimum construction (and minimum visibility from the outside world) to set the shape of the track. The extra benefit of the height of the mountain meant that the catapulted object would make it quite a ways up in elevation before it even left the track, meaning less energy spent. The location along the equator was ideal in that anything launched would require minimal adjustments once in orbit to attain a geosynchronicity circling the planet, or to orbital trajectories further out, say. It was these outbound trajectories that were important for the second stage of the project. The third stage would change the world.\n\nOnce the rail, dubbed the Kilimanjaro Third Arm Launch Facility (or K3ALF for a slightly less unwieldy title) had been finished, there was a massive marketing push to popularize it and as always, it was easier to ask for forgiveness after the fact than for the initial permissions. After a few test runs; the brave astronautical test pilot's proud and triumphant (widely broadcast across the internet and televisions of the world) flight, not to forget his grinning mug, (also widely broadcast) telling the citizens just how beautiful their small blue world was from where he sat and that humanity should get over their petty squabbles, blah blah blah, and the usual insertion or two of new commercial satellites, (to pay for the previous' advertising), the project was much lauded for it's forward thinking and advancement of Mankind. Once the launch facility was fully operational, it was not unusual to hear the distant thunder from a bullet-shaped vehicle hitting multiple times the speed of sound and leaving nothing but a vapor contrail and a wide cloud halo around the peak of the slumbering volcano. \n\nThe third phase began with renewed landings on Earth's lonely companion, the Moon. And at the beginning of the new year, a permanent facility had been constructed in the Copernicus crater that utilized the sloping wall along with the relative flatness of it's basin, (in a slightly funhouse mirror image) to build a smaller sister version of the Kilimanjaro launch rail for the benefit of propelling craft on their return trip to Terra Firma. The public was told that the construction in Copernicus, (named the Arthur C. Clarke Platform; it wasn't in Clavius or the Tycho Crater but the name was fitting, and no one objected to honoring the famous co-author of \"2001 - A Space Odyssey\") would be primarily used to explore the lunar surface, research into the rocky terrain for the possibilities of future mineral prospects, and mainly; mankind's first proper foothold into space proper, where the foundation of exploration to the outer reaches of the solar system would begin.\n\nThese things were all true; proper and successful lies are always obfuscated in a web of truth. As it had been since the beginning of the massive project, there were no lies told. It was what went by unsaid that paid for all in the end. Ironically, this venture having been covered up until it was ready at K3ALF by the publics works programs was in turn a cover for the real strategy, a plan that only a handful of people outside the project were aware of.  Even the majority of the crews at the Arthur C. Clarke site were unaware of what they were a part of and if they were told, they probably wouldn't have believed it anyway.\n\n(6/16/16)","title":"[SP] The Third Arm of Kilimanjaro"},"questions":[{"question":"What was the main aim of the public works (Kilimanjaro Resource Reclamation) that were set up in Tanzania?","answers":[{"answer":"The main aim of the public works that was set up in Tanzania was to tap into the easy accessible water due to melting snows that had been increasing at the pinnacle of Kilimanjaro.","critiques":[{"critique":"The snowfall was a result of the changing climate due to human influence.","feedback":{"helpful":false}},{"critique":"This is inaccurate.

Minera Chungar, S.A.C. After the 1971 disaster, this mining company, keeping the same name, transferred the operations 16 km NE to the Animón mine in the Huarón Mining District.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2008, Compañía Minera Cerro S.A. rehabilitated some underground workings and had a small scale operation.\n\nSince 2015, the mining company Volcan is exploring the surroundings of the Chungar Mine (Romina project) including the Puagjanca area where a Zn-Pb-(Ag) ore body was discovered.[5]\n\n\nConfusion on the term “Chungar Mine”\n\nThe mining company Volcan through its now subsidiary Compañía Minera Chungar S.A.C.[6], operates the polymetallic Animón and Islay mines, in the Huarón Mining District, located 16 km NE of the actual Chungar Mine, under the term “Mining Unit Chungar”[7] (Unidad minera Chungar[8]). The use by Volcan of this term “Chungar Mining Unit”[9][10][11] has caused some confusion, and certain sources (e.g., the data base “alicia.concytec.gob.pe”[12] and a WoodMackenzie Report[13]) use wrongly the term of “Chungar mine” for the Animón mine.\n\n\nGeological Frame\n\nThe Chungar skarn deposit belongs to the Miocene polymetallic belt of Central Peru.[14] The skarn Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag mineralization occurs mainly at the western contact of the Chungar Granite with limestone of the Cretaceous Jumasha Formation and in roof pendants.[15] Ore consists mainly of sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, and pyrrhotite in andradite skarn.[16] Age determinations on the outcropping Chungar granite yield an age of 12.88 ± 0.36 Ma (Ar/Ar biotite plateau age)[17] that is consistent with previous K-Ar age determinations.[18]\n\nSimilar skarn occurrences are known north and south of the Chungar Mine (e.g. Don Miguel prospect, , 8 km north of the Chungar Mine and 1 km E of the Chalhuacocha granodiorite, which was K-Ar dated at 10.0±0.3 Ma on biotite,[19] and the Puagjanca ore body, 4 km to the south[20]).\n\n[1] https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-do-landslides-cause-tsunamis?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products landslide tsunamis, USGS, retrieved on April 15, 2020\n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] Volcan 2019; Memoria Anual 2018; 199 p.\n\n[6] Company profile Compañía Minera Chungar S.A.C.,bnamericas.com, retrieved on April 6, 2020\n\n[7] Volcan, Mining units, retrieved on April 6, 2020\n\n[8] Volcan, Unidades Mineras, retrieved on April 6, 2020\n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] miningdataonline\n\n[12] Data Base “alicia.concytec.gob.pe” retrieved on April 6, 2020\n\n[13] Chungar zinc mine, WoodMackenzie Report, retrieved on April 6, 2020\n\n[14] Noble, D.

Andrew Cuomo received in the past six months easily topped the growing field of potential challengers this year.\n\nWho came in second place? Not Republican Brian Kolb ( who raised $16,026 for governor on top of $42,387 in his Assembly account), Democrat Terry Gipson ($6,092), or Republican Joel Giambra ($0). Republican John DeFrancisco raised $116,452 for a pair of state Senate committees, but has yet to declare whether he’ll seek statewide office.\n\nBy a wide margin, the declared candidate who received the second-highest contribution total was Larry Sharpe, who’s planning to run on the Libertarian line. He raised $102,596 during the filing period, most of which he said came from small donors who contributed online.\n\nIn a state in which voters are reluctant to embrace Republicans — Democrats have won the past 19 statewide races — Sharpe plans to present himself as a potential alternative to voters who don’t like Cuomo.\n\n“The Republican vote is a wasted vote,” he said. “There is no way a Republican can win in this state. The advantage that I have is I’m not a Republican, I’m a Libertarian. … So when New York state looks at the Republican and says, ‘Not that guy,’ and they look at Cuomo and say, ‘Not that guy’ — I’m their guy.”\n\nSharpe, a former trucking company executive and Marine, sought the national party’s nomination to be Gary Johnson’s running mate in the 2016 national election. He came close, losing with 47 percent of the vote on the second ballot at the party's convention to former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld (who once ran for governor in New York himself).\n\nHe’s already gained Johnson’s endorsement, and partially as a result of his efforts in 2016, Sharpe has a substantial online presence. A Facebook page for his gubernatorial campaign has 41,000 followers. Cuomo’s political page, by comparison, has 129,000, and neither of the two declared Republicans has many more than 3,000.\n\nMuch of that following and his fundraising likely comes from Libertarians from other states. But the magnitude of it, coupled with the fact that Sharpe already has started to campaign, makes it realistic to imagine a scenario in which he crosses the magic threshold of 50,000 votes.\n\nWhen a candidate hits that number in a gubernatorial election, a little more than 1 percent of the votes cast, the party becomes official in New York. For the next four years, the party has automatic ballot access, appears on voter registration forms and has the state fund its primaries.\n\nEight parties crossed that threshold in 2014. But outside of a 48,359-vote performance by Warren Redlich in 2010, Libertarians have never come particularly close.\n\nSharpe said it was \"a joke\" to talk about his chances of garnering at least 50,000 votes. “I already have a base of [176,000] people who vote for Gary Johnson and Bill Weld in 2016,\" he said. \"I’ll get that easily.”\n\nThird-party candidates have rarely been competitive in New York’s gubernatorial races. Paychex founder Tom Golisano drew between 4 and 14 percent of the vote in a trio of campaigns that began in 1994, but there have only been two elections since the Civil War in which a candidate not running on either the Democratic or Republican lines has come close to finishing in even second place.\n\nDespite this track record, Sharpe says he’s running not just to legitimize the party, but to win.\n\n“Only about 4 million New Yorkers are going to vote,” he said, suggesting that somebody might win election as governor without a majority in a three-way race. “So that means all I need is about 1.5 million and I’m governor. That’s a mountain, but that’s not impossible.”\n\nHe says there are four areas that will determine who is ultimately elected — traditional media coverage, public speaking, social media and debates. While he’s ready to concede coverage by traditional media, he thinks he can be competitive in the other three.\n\n“When it comes to speaking and events, it’s not his skill set, he’s not good at that,” Sharpe said of Cuomo.\n\nCuomo has had lackluster grass-roots support online in the past, and Sharpe is confident he’ll outshine the incumbent in this arena. “He is a dire soul when it comes to social media,\" he said, \"so I’ll beat him there for sure.”\n\nAnd he says he’ll handily beat the governor in any debates, asserting that Cuomo is \"not a very good debater.\"\n\nWhen asked what he would do if he wins, Sharpe said he would make entities like the Board of Regents and Metropolitan Transportation Authority be more accountable, putting them under the authority of specific offices that would have to answer for any problems.\n\nBefore he even gets on the ballot, however, he’ll have to win the Libertarian Party’s state convention in April, but doesn’t see this as a roadblock.\n\n“Assuming there’s no celebrity that jumps in and says, ‘I want to be on the ballot,’ the odds are very high I’ll be the nominee,” Sharpe said.\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize the main news event.","answers":[{"answer":"New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, has received $5.9 million in donations, easily outstripping all Republican challengers.

He had a look of anticipation, as if he was waiting for some pain relieving gossip. \n\n“I was home,” I responded innocently before he rolled his eyes at me. “Now, don’t bother me, I’m trying to focus.” Although normally I would use anything to distract me from school, I wasn’t about to involve Max in last night’s mess.\n\n“Are you expecting me to believe you weren’t at Nina’s party?” He raised his eyebrows at me. I didn’t know what I was expecting. Frankly, no expectation in the world would have prepared me well enough. But I wanted to be there for Nina like she had for me. Perhaps I couldn’t fix her parent’s divorce, but I could at least attend her house party. Especially after her break up with Todd, the leather jacket douche that called her “babe” so much I would wonder if he knew her real name.\n\n“I promise you’ll have a great time,” Nina had told me. And at first, I really did. There is something comforting about the stagnant smell of beer penetrating every fiber of clothing and hair follicle. Something nostalgic about repetitive rap songs preaching about the wonders of big asses. \n\nEverything seemed normal at first. The music was pounding loudly and the dim lights carried shadows across the cramped living room. I could feel the air thickening. \n\nMinutes before terror, I was standing unnoticed next to a group of girls I recognized. \n\n“Someone told me her dad was abusive,” I heard one say with wide eyes. \n\n“Yeah, apparently the neighbors called the cops on them,” another responded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t point fingers just yet.

I clenched my fists in rage. \n\n“How about you all mind your own–”. My response was cut short by a piercing scream. I quickly stood up in alert. The room became still. The music stopped and those still standing looked at one another with puzzled looks. The source was nowhere to be seen. It came again, this time along with a cry. I recognized Nina immediately. I pushed my way across the living room and ran up the stairs before barging into Nina’s bedroom.\n\nI noticed him first. His leather jacket shimmered in the moonlight as he stood tall and angry. A millisecond later, I spotted Nina on the floor. Hands covering her face in defense. The lack of light in the room didn’t stop the fierceness of her blood as it dripped down her temple and into her hair. \n\nI stood still. My brain called in fear but my body made no response. Not even when Todd walked passed me, into the hallway and shut the door behind him. \n\nNina remained on the floor. She held herself and rocked back and forth, letting silent cries out into the thick air. \n\n“Don’t tell anyone.” She whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” Max snapped at me. “Are you going to tell me or not?” I stared at him blankly as the vivid flashbacks flew through my head. My heart stung in bitterness as I recognized that all I wanted to do was say it. To write it out in sharpie on all student lockers.\n\nNina’s bloody face burned in my head. “There’s nothing to tell.”","title":"[RF] Last Night Leftovers"},"questions":[{"question":"What does the passage say about Todd?","answers":[{"answer":"Todd is Nina's ex-boyfriend.

It was invented by a college dropout named Richard Drew from Minnesota who worked for a small sandpaper company founded in 1902 called Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, later known as 3M. The name \"Scotch\" itself has an origin story almost as interesting as the invention of Scotch tape.\n\nBorn Richard Gurley Drew in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1899, Drew spent a year at the University of Minnesota in the Mechanical Engineering program before dropping out. He paid for that time at school and his correspondence school course in machine design by playing banjo, and he included all of that information in his application to the open position of lab technician with 3M. He got the job and was set on the path to make history.\n\nIn the 1920s, a two-tone paint job was popular for cars and a headache for automotive painters. The two-tone look was created by painting the car one color, applying a barrier of some sort to the painted portion, and then painting the next section. In order to get around the difficulties of this type of paint job, painters and mechanics tested out different ways to achieve the look. Unfortunately, their attempts tended to be less than successful. Some automotive shops would glue newspapers over the already painted sections while others used tape to prevent paint transfer. However those techniques often left a sticky residue on the paint that was difficult to remove. Sometimes, it would even mean the painters had to do the entire paint job over again.\n\nOne of Drew's responsibilities at 3M was to deliver samples of sandpaper to local automotive shops for testing, where he often overheard workers who were painting complain about the problems with tape used for these paint jobs. The twenty-three year old then lab assistant got the idea to create a new tape that would create a seal so that the paint wouldn't get through and yet also come off clean without leaving any sticky residue that ruined the paint finish. Drew used the adhesive that 3M utilized in the construction of its sandpaper as a starting point. From there, it took him two years of experimentation with different types of adhesives that he applied to a crepe paper backing to come up with the right combination. Thus, what would be called \"Scotch\" Masking Tape was born in 1925.\n\nThe success of the Scotch Brand Masking Tape allowed Drew to move up the ranks at 3M. In 1929, his position as technical director at the fabrication laboratory allowed him to pursue another idea. Cellophane had recently been invented by DuPont and was being used by grocers and bakers as a neat way to package their groceries. However, there wasn't a good way to seal the cellophane with tape because the colored backing ruined the clear look. So Drew and his team of inventors worked to create a tape that used this clear cellophane as a backing.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission\n\nUnfortunately, the machinery that 3M used in order to apply the adhesive to the cellophane backing tore the material, and the glue that worked for the masking tape appeared amber on the clear cellophane. The team ultimately invented new clear adhesive and modified machinery to handle the cellophane. The new tape was called Scotch Brand Cellulose Tape, but it appeared that it might have missed its opportunity with grocers and bakers despite ringing endorsements from several test clients. You see, DuPont had introduced into the market a cellophane that could be sealed with heat. Nonetheless, despite missing their original target market and being released during the Great Depression, the Scotch Brand Cellulose Tape thrived with various home uses.\n\nSo this all brings us back to how the term \"Scotch\" came to be associated with 3M's Masking and Cellulose tapes. When Drew and 3M began allowing car painters to test the new Scotch Brand Masking Tape, one painter supposedly complained about the lack of adhesive on the tape. One version of the story claims that the painter asked \"Why so Scotch with the adhesive?\" Another version states that the painter said \"Take this back to your Scotch bosses and tell them to put more adhesive on it.\"\n\nWhatever the case, in the 1920s, the term \"Scotch\" was a racial slang term that meant something or someone that was cheap or stingy. Based on the feedback, Drew applied more adhesive to the tape and ultimately branded the tape with the pejorative \"stingy\" name of \"Scotch.\"\n\nIf you liked this article, you might also enjoy:\n\n-   What the Company Name \"3M\" Stands For\n-   The Invention Nobody Wanted That Became One of the Top Selling Office Products of All Time\n-   A Brief History of the Ballpoint Pen and Whether NASA Really Spent Millions Developing a Pressurized Version Instead of Just Using Pencils\n-   Super Glue was Invented by Accident, Twice\n-   Who Invented Duct Tape\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_Sarah Stone writes for the mildly popular interesting fact website_ _TodayIFoundOut.com__.

In this short story I am going to describe the infamous and horrible tale of what can be only called as “the monstrosity.” \n\nThe monstrosity was born in 1945, his exact date of birth is unknown, he was born in Midwestern America; most likely Kansas. His father was a hulk of a man who conceived him when he brutally raped his own daughter, the violence in the monster’s life began before he was even born. His mother lets call her Lesly was only seventeen years old when she gave birth to the monstrosity, who was born about three weeks premature. Lesly almost died in childbirth because the monster’s father (lets call him Larry) continued to beat her during the pregnancy which led to the premature and extremely painful birth. The doctors predicted the monstrosity would not live through the night...oh how wrong they were; looking back if the doctors knew of the evil they allowed to enter the world, they may have had no problem suffocating that small innocent child right there and then. \nThe monstrosity had no serious health problems from the violent birth, except for the fact that he would never grow taller than 5'5 even as a grown man; this monster’s height comes into play later and can be looked at as a curse or a blessing depending on how you read this evil’s story. \n\nThe monster’s father Larry remarried shortly after he was born, he lied to all about the real mother of the monster. Being a minor still Lesly was forced to continue to live with Larry and his new wife Marie even after all the abuse and pain he had caused her, she wouldn't run away because she felt her son deserved a real mother not a life of lies. So, for the next three-years she worked hard at her job as a waitress to save enough money to move out of the abusive home with her son and get her own place. The abuse of Lesly continued throughout these years but Larry didn’t touch his son the monster because he respected the fact that his son had a keen likeness to himself, and resented the fact that his own daughter Lesly wanted to turn his own child against him. Larry wasn't a sociopath but he was a monster by his own merit, he didn't understand why his daughter hated him and thought he was a useless excuse for a men let alone a father; even though he sexually and physically abused her after her mother passed away from cancer when Lesly was about nine-years old. Larry tried to turn the monster who was about four years old by this point against his true mother Lesly and make him love his wife Marie and him as parents. \n\nNow, for a moment let us observe what know about Larry’s second wife Marie...she was about twenty-six years old married to Larry a much older man and little is known about her background or early-life. What we do know however straight from the words of our little monster is that she was an extremely beautiful woman; about 5’9, luscious blond hair, long legs, a nice curvy midsection, and most of all her skin according to the monster was softer than any other woman he ever met. But that all comes in to play later in this story of true evil. \nI will set the scene for the beginnings of our little monster’s first look at death and real cruelty. Of course the monster was exposed to the beatings of his real mother Lesly from time to time, but Marie did her best to keep the monster away from such things. You may be thinking why would a woman as beautiful as I described Marie as be with a violent man like Larry and allow him to abuse his adult daughter? Well, since little is known about Marie’s personality (at this point in time) I guess we can just say love works in mysterious ways and in this case ends up intertwined with death and unknowingly creating pure evil. Anyway, back to the story...Lesly finally saved up enough money to take the monster away from this hateful environment and get her own nice place. But Larry and Marie didn’t like that idea, they didn’t believe that Lesly really worked for that money and accused her of prostituting herself to make the money. They called her all sorts of names, not knowing that our little monster was hiding under the bed in his mother’s room just taking all this in. Like I said he had witnessed violence before, but never had he witnessed such abuse in a verbal sense they broke his mother down. Lesly wasn't the most emotionally sound woman due to her father’s abuse and it didn't take much to break her, and by the end of the verbal abuse from Marie and Larry which went on for almost an hour she just sat in the corner wet with her own tears and ashamed that she allowed them to do that to her. \n\nThen something happened to Lesly as she set there wallowing in her own pain and self-hate...she snapped. This young woman who received awful abuse by her own father her whole life finally snapped. She hated him with such passion, who was he to abuse her and then coddle her son like he was a decent human being when he was the one who raped her and almost killed her from beatings during her pregnancy! Lesly was not a small woman, her father Larry was about 6’6 and 250-pounds and he passed those genes onto his daughter; she was 6’3 but her weight was unknown. She grabbed Larry’s baseball bat that he used to occasionally use to beat her when he wasn't playing on the local softball team with it, and she waited in the room until she heard Marie go into her room and fall asleep. She left her room, and shortly after the monster (without her knowledge) followed her into the hallway and watched her. \n\nShe saw that Larry was passed out on the couch and she snuck up behind him, only his head was exposed from under the covers. Lesly raised the bat above her head and slammed it back down with all the might and power she had within her body. The sound of Larry’s skull cracking was sickening to the soul of a normal person...you could hear the skull break apart into small fragments and slice through the brain matter. You could taste the blood in the air and feel the lack of Larry’s existence within it. Even though our monster was only four or five years old, he describes the event with such vivid remembrance as if it was his first memory. And maybe it was, because in my opinion this moment and what happened next is what creates our little monster as he really is or will be for the rest of his so called life. \n\t\nLarry was near dead after the first blow, but Lesly didn't know that and probably felt more powerful and in control than she ever had before in her entire life. She kept hitting him over and over, she destroyed his face so completely that it would take a ton of work for the cops to identify his body without just assuming. The monster describes hearing the life leave Larry’s body but instead of like it is in film he described it as just a silence within the room as if Larry’s soul or whatever made him alive had just been removed from the area. The silence as he described it was quieter than anything he would experience for a long time after. \n\t\nThan the silence was broken by Lesly yelling at the monster “go to your room, you shouldn't see this baby.” Her voice wasn't the same though it sounded different than the mother the monster though he knew, it sounded emptier as if the love Lesly held for him had exited her. And even at five years old the monster says that he felt the difference. \n","title":"The monstrosity"},"questions":[{"question":"How is the \"monstrosity\" described in this article?","answers":[{"answer":"The story is written in a horror style, with a lot of horror tropes, including describing the \"monstrosity\" as a literal monster, possibly with supernatural traits a la Frankenstein's monster.

Qonqurtai was Hulagu's ninth son and was the senior commander during the reign of his brother Abaqa. He was twice appointed as viceroy of Anatolia, first during the reign of Abaqa and then under Tekuder. His winter quarters were in Kazova plains near Tokat, while his viceroyalty itself has centred around Kayseri.\n\n\nRule in Anatolia\n\nQonqurtai was appointed as commander of Ilkhanid army in Anatolia with Shams al-Din Juvayni as his vizier after the Battle of Elbistan in 1277 to support the Sultanate of Rum against revolting Turcomans.[1] He pursed Jimri, a claimant to Seljuk throne, and attacked his patrons - the Karamanids. As a consequence, Mehmet I of Karaman was captured and executed together with his sons Mahmud and Karaman in October 1277.[2] Qonqurtai further authorised Sâhib Ata to act on his behalf. He aided Kaykhusraw III's efforts to subdue Karamanids and Eshrefids in 1282. However, Qonqurtai had to cease his activities upon hearing the death of Abaqa.\n\nUpon the death of Abaqa, Qonqurtai supported Tekuder's succession in Maragha, who in return gave him the hand of Toqiyatai Khatun, a Keraite concubine of Hulagu and niece of Dokuz Khatun on 12 July 1282. He was also re-appointed as viceroy of Anatolia the same day.[3] However, later in Tekuder's reign, he shifted his alliance to Arghun, which made the former suspicious. Qonqurtai was summoned to Karabakh, accused of conspiracy and was arrested by Tegüder's son-in-law, Alinaq - the viceroy of Georgia on 17 January 1284, and was executed next day by breaking his neck.[4] Later, Arghun had put Tekuder on trial for Qonqurtai's death, who suffered the same penalty as him.\n\n\nPersonality\n\nHe was described as a wise ruler in _Zafarnamah_ by Hamdullah Mustawfi,[5] while Qalawun considered him as a not only dishonorable, but also cruel man.[6]\n\n\nFamily\n\nHe was married to Toqiyatai Khatun (d. 1292), a Keraite concubine of Hulagu and niece of Dokuz Khatun on 12 July 1282, and only two of his children reached adulthood.[7]:\n\n1.

However, her first story was _Trudi and Hansel_ (1938), set in the Austrian Tyrol. The girl Trudi, the boy Hansel, the cow Lotti, the dog Berni, the hen Griselda and the raven Kraak all go up the mountain to see Riese the giant, and then all come down again. Eleanor Farjeon gave the book a positive review: “Nora Lavrin's delicious crayon illustrations are the gay and unsophisticated complement to Averil Demuth's Tyrolean tale ... I like this book very much”.[1] A biographical sketch of Demuth appeared in the children's book club magazine _Young Wings_.[2] _The House in the Mountains_ (1940), illustrated by Grace Huxtable, was set in Kandergurgl, a little Swiss village. Max, Lisel and the other children encounter a witch, a wicked baron, Ruffin the dog, Mr Fooks the fox and Mr Trog the bear in a story with kidnappings, magic, secret passages and a ransom.[3]\n\nIn 1941 she was living in Heston, Cornwall.[4] She married Anthony Cockbain in Penzance in 1941, though he died in November 1942,[5] after only one year of marriage.[6]\n\n_The Enchanted Islands_ (1941) was followed by _Sea Gypsies_ (1942), a holiday story of Peter and Petronel on an “enchanted island”, where the “little people” were as real as humans. The _Manchester Guardian_ reviewer welcomed the book: “This story is very well done”.[7]_The House of the Wind_(1953) was an adventure story set in Cornwall. One reviewer remarked that the story “spurns the hygenic world of normal holidays and enters into Lyonese and ancient magic without being objectionably fey”.[8]\n\nIn 1968 Demuth edited a book about the Minack Theatre: six people connected to the theatre described their activities, and Demuth herself gave a historical account of the theatre.[9] She died on 16 May 2000 in Penzance.\n\n\nWorks\n\n-   (with Norman Demuth) _Two ships: unison song_.

Home\n2.  News\n3.  Spaceflight\n\nSpaceX will attempt the first launch of its new giant rocket, the Falcon Heavy, on Feb. 6, the company's CEO Elon Musk said Saturday (Jan. 27).\n\nThe much-anticipated maiden flight of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket will lift off from the historic Launch Pad 39A — the same one used for NASA's Apollo moon missions and space shuttle flights — at the agency's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Musk's announcement came three days after SpaceX test-fired the Falcon Heavy's 27 first-stage engines for the first time at the launchpad on Wednesday (Jan. 24).\n\n\"Aiming for first flight of Falcon Heavy on Feb. 6 from Apollo launchpad 39A at Cape Kennedy,\" Musk wrote on Twitter. \"Easy viewing from the public causeway.\" [In Photos: SpaceX's 1st Falcon Heavy Rocket at the Pad]\n\nWhile Musk did not specify a launch time for the Falcon Heavy's first flight, the mission may lift off during a three-hour launch window that opens at 1:30 p.m. EST (1830 GMT), according to a SpaceNews report. A backup launch date is available the following day, SpaceNews added.\n\n[SpaceX's first Falcon Heavy rocket stands atop Launch Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket's debut launch is scheduled for Feb. 6, 2018.]\n\nSpaceX's first Falcon Heavy rocket stands atop Launch Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket's debut launch is scheduled for Feb. 6, 2018. (Image credit: SpaceX)\nSpaceX's Falcon Heavy booster is the most powerful rocket since NASA's Saturn V moon rocket. Its first stage consists of three Falcon 9 cores that are designed to return to Earth after launch much like the company's solo Falcon 9 flights.  \n\nThe heavy-lift rocket stands 230 feet tall (70 meters) and is designed to launch payloads of up to 119,000 lbs. (57 metric tons) into space. It can carry twice the load of its nearest rival: the Delta IV Heavy built by the United Launch Alliance.  \n\nFor its debut flight, the Falcon Heavy is carrying Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster into space. Musk has said the launch, if successful, will deliver the Roadster into a heliocentric orbit that will eventually send the midnight-cherry-red electric car by Mars.\n\nHowever, Musk has repeatedly attempted to lower expectations for the Falcon Heavy's first flight, saying there is a fair chance the launch could fail.\n\n\"There's a lot that could go wrong there,\" Musk said last year. \"I encourage people to come down to the Cape to see the first Falcon Heavy mission; it's guaranteed to be exciting.\"\n\nAnd Musk isn't alone in promising excitement. The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex (KSCVC), which offers tickets to view launches from Florida's Space Coast, unveiled a series of Falcon Heavy launch viewing packages on Thursday (Jan. 25).\n\nThose launch viewing packages range in price from $35 per person (for simple viewing access and parking) to the already-sold-out $195 per person \"Feel the Heat\" package, which offers two-day admission to the KSC Visitor Complex, transportation to a viewing area at the complex's Apollo/Saturn V Center, a trip to the Shuttle Landing Facility, a catered meal, SpaceX hat and other amenities.\n\n\"When SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy lifts off from Kennedy Space Center's famed Pad 39A, the same launchpad from which Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong set course for the moon on Apollo 11 in 1969, a new kind of history will be made,\" KSCVC representatives said in the announcement.\n\nSpaceX's Falcon Heavy test flight will come one week after the company's next mission. That flight will launch a Falcon 9 rocket carrying the GovSat-1 communications satellite from Space Launch Complex-40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. \n\n_Email Tariq Malik at tmalik@space.com or follow him_ _@tariqjmalik_ _and_ _Google+.__ Follow us_ _@Spacedotcom__,_ _Facebook__ and_ _Google+__.

That was my mother’s mantra. She said it after every hard shift, every failed test, every break up, and every argument. She whispered it into my ears as she wiped tears off my cheeks. I used to tell myself the same thing when things went awry. I had always put faith into words, especially those words. Words defined my life.\nIt was 4:15 in the morning on the sixteenth of July. There was nothing special about the time or the date, but my brain woke me up regardless. I remember how cold it was in my room. I reached out of bed, tapped the small touch lamp on the bedside table, grabbed the robe that hung off the post of my bed and buried myself inside of it. Sliding my feet into my slippers, I crossed the room to turn on my space heater.\n\n\nHad I lived anywhere else, the heater probably would’ve been stored away with holiday decorations and winter jackets, but I didn’t live anywhere else. I lived in a studio apartment with very little space. I didn’t own any holiday decorations and all of my winter clothes were hung up and stuffed into my little closet behind all of my summer clothes. I crossed the room and turned the knob on my fourteen dollar space heater to the single notch that signified power level one. The lamp lost a little bit of light. I shuffled toward my bed, kicked off the slippers and did a belly flop onto the mattress. The room filled with the quiet hum of the heater converting the temperature of the air and I squirmed under the comforter. Laying in my bed, wrapped in a robe and snuggled under a blanket, I knew I wasn’t getting back to sleep that night. I had only slept for about three hours and already my brain had kicked me into consciousness and given me the finger. I laid there for a few minutes and decided, ’Fuck it. If I’m going to be awake, I’m going to work’. I grabbed the laptop from the other side of the end table, nearly knocking the lamp off as I did. I pushed the lamp back into place, increasing its brightness ever so slightly. I flipped the laptop open and was greeted by a page full of text.\n\n\nWords had always comforted me. Growing up, my mother always knew exactly what to say to make things better. She had so many pearls of wisdom to hand out and I had always eagerly accepted them. It had just been her and I growing up. After I was born, the doctor told her she wouldn’t have any more children. Her husband, who I refused to acknowledge as being my father (why should I, I never even saw his face), couldn’t stand to be with a woman who couldn’t provide him with a son so he left her with her daughter without a trace. Kids at school were always kind enough to point out how weird it was that Lindsay didn’t have a dad and when I would report their observations to my mother, she would always get down on her knees, put her hands on my shoulders and ask me, “Are those children smarter than you?” to which I always replied, “No”. Her follow up would be something similar to “Are the girls prettier than you?” This question had bothered me because I looked nothing like my mother (which, naturally, meant that I looked like her ex-husband). But, in the end, the answer was usually “No”. She would ask if they were stronger or braver than me and, as the queen of dares and arm wrestling, I always responded in the negative. She would wrap all of these questions up with one final one, the only one that really mattered.\n\n\n“So then, Lindsay, are the kids with fathers better than you?”\n\n\nAnd I always knew they weren’t. There were some kids in town that were, but they all went to a private school and I never had to see them anyway. I went to the only public school in my town. Everyone knew everyone else and we were all poor. No one had a guest bedroom and most of the houses had only one bathroom. My mom worked as a nurse during the day at the local nursing home and bartended during the night. She was always home when I woke up, when school let out, and when I went to sleep. As soon as I was old enough, I got a job helping out at the library after school. I got lost in books and excelled in English and ended up writing my way out of that little town and into Chicago. I took my mother with me, but she didn’t make it very long in a big city. She was exceedingly proud of my success but I always told her that she was the one who had given it to me.\n\n\nI opened the laptop to find a page mostly filled with words. They were small money words. I hadn’t produced big money words since my mother died. I watched the cursor blink, waiting to be jettisoned across the screen by a slew of creativity or inspiration but it just stood there and blinked at me. I was in the middle of reading the paragraph preceding the boring cursor when I heard a rattling outside of my bedroom. My brain shut down and I stared at my bedroom door, waiting to see if it would bust inward. Someone was in my apartment. I knew that because the closest I came to a pet was the plastic tree by the front door and the dead fern by the window. I remember thinking ’Who the fuck would break in to my shitty apartment?’ but that didn’t matter. What mattered was that somebody had. My lamp was on and my laptop was illuminating my room, so whoever it was probably knew that I was awake. Did they know that I knew they were there?","title":"[MS] Actually looking for feedback on my firsts few paragraphs"},"questions":[{"question":"Who is the narrator's most important familiar relation?","answers":[{"answer":"Her mother.","critiques":[{"critique":"The narrator's father is also important to her.","feedback":{"helpful":false}}]}],"rankings":[null],"is_critiqueable":false,"has_better_critique":null,"new_critique":null},{"question":"What does the motif of words mean in the story?","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator's mother always knew what to say to make things better.

Dripping with slimy seaweed and lake water the hand paddled furiously. Suddenly, the famous King Arthur shot out of the water, finding himself gasping for air. Arthur’s other hand emerged from the icy depths, paddling against its watery grave. King Arthur sighed a sigh of relief. He was finally home. Where were his people? Had it really been that long?\n\nHe spun around, trying to locate the shore. He finally homed in on some birds flying in wide circles high in the sky. Arthur paddled his legs and arms in their general direction, hoping for any sign of relief from this strenuous fight for life.\n\nThe swim was hard, but The King had nearly reached the border in which marked the end of this journey, and the beginning of the next. The shore. King Arthur waded through the last bit of water, too tired to swim. “Twilight?” The king spoke with a harsh British accent. It wasn’t really, the polluted air had made it seem darker than it really was. \n\nThe King found himself on a silky sand beach, the course rock he once knew had eroded into the perfect sand castle building material. “I have been away many years,” Arthur said in a hushed tone of grief and sorrow. “Whither will I go now?”\n\nArthur jumped with remembrance, almost forgetting a very important role in his life. He had first seen Excalibur when he was eleven, in a nook of a tree, sitting ever so mocking, telling him to take it and run. He didn’t. But Excalibur stopped at nothing. It came again. Arthur remembered the day vividly. A month day after his twelfth birthday. The same sword, this time screaming at him to take it. He did that time. His only sword and companion had fought many battles since then. Much bloodshed in the name of his people.\n\nThe King keeled down on one knee, he raised his hand, and with an inaudible command the sky was ripped apart, revealing a blinding light. Arthur was thrown down, unable to overcome the intense force that Excalibur brought. Then, as soon as it had started, it had ended. The only trace of it ever happening was the sword held in King Arthur's worn right hand. \n\nArthur walked forward, dripping with sweat, clutching Excalibur with all his might. Although there was nothing to be afraid of, not now. He saw no one and he wondered if his people, all Arthur had worked for, had dyed off. Conquered by another nation. The great and powerful king shuddered at the thought.\n\nKing Arthur came to a black strip of land with a yellow stripe down the middle, although he had no idea how they made it, he knew exactly what it was. A road. This was reassuring, to know that his people had progressed in technology. He wasn’t only talking about the road, but the machines that must have used it. Merlin had warned him of that much.\n\nA small drug store, across the road, was the only thing Arthur saw. He was intimidated by the miniature structure. But he tried to believe his people would remember their king of old. Arthur walked in, a small bell sounded. The room was dimly lit, with a man in a black beanie and a gun pointed to the cashier. Arthur saw the look in the thieves eye’s, the most intense gaze of hatred. “Halt! In the name of King Arthur!” The man whirled around in fear and astonishment. He aimed the gun to Arthur's head and squeezed the trigger. \n\n\n**If I receive enough feedback I would love to continue the adventures of King Arthur!

He’s very quiet I haven’t really seen him give anyone orders at all either. Whenever something needs to be done I see him doing it. He doesn’t just sit around; I’ve actually seen him go into the mines. I don’t know if it’s just because I’m a child but not even the adults in the village are as active as him.\t\n\n       He’s always leaving the kingdom and coming back with tons of different things. I can’t always see what he’s coming back with, but I’ve seen bones, some kind of meat that just looks bad, and even strange looking pearls. And the dogs! He has so many dogs that there’s not a single wild dog here. He must be traveling great distances to find all these dogs, because I know they’re not from here. \n\n\tWhen I see him doing all these strange things I start asking my parents what it is he’s doing, and they tell me: “don’t question the king,” but they never tell me why. He doesn’t look old, so he can’t be all that wise. All that work he does and all the times he leaves - it’s not normal.  I was  sick of wondering.\n\n\tI finally got into his castle and he was at his workbench. When I got closer he looked back at me, seemingly confused, but he turned back around and kept tinkering with some weird red dust. I got closer and mustered up the courage to ask him as politely as I could, “How come you’re so different than everyone else?” The king stopped, stood up and looked at me. He asked, “Excuse me?” and I said it again. He chuckled briefly under his breath and said “it seems like you’re different too.”\n\t\n       He started to tell me a story. “When I was your age, I lived in a different kingdom and I felt the same way about my king. I would go to school and all the kids and the teachers would seem to just drift through their lives, but not the king; he was always spontaneous. I was finally sick of that curious feeling, so I went and talked to my king and he told me his story. Sometime afterwards the kingdom was destroyed and all the people inside were attacked by monsters. It was terrible. There were explosions, arrows, and the groans of the undead. \n\n\tI was able to escape, but barely. I fought my way out with nothing but my hands. finally I found a break in the chaos and I found a cave and covered the entrance with dirt. I was devastated, but I wanted to live so I built a shelter.  I enjoyed building. Then since I had built my shelter I began mining - I enjoyed that as well. I had so many supplies I decided to build more and I ended up building a village. Strangely enough people appeared. That village moved on to become this kingdom. That’s my story.”\n\n\tI asked him why he told me all that. and he told me simply because I was a player. A player? I was so confused. He then told me that only players are kings. I didn’t understand. He went on by asking me what my earliest memory is and I told him standing outside. “Exactly,” He said. “That was the first time you entered this world.” He started talking about how this life isn’t real and that once he’s gone he’ll be able to enter the real world again.\n\n\tHe began taking me adventuring with him, that’s when he would explain things and share his knowledge with me. “When a king dies, everything he ever did goes with him. That’s how my king’s old kingdom was destroyed. I left my Kingdom and made a village. I have people of my own now. My king was killed by a mob of three suicide creatures right outside his gate. I saw everything he had made disappear along with him.” That’s when I believed everything he told me - while he took me adventuring with him.

This is a story I wrote for my intro to creative writing class. I'm thinking about double majoring of maybe minoring in the subject. If you could let me know what you think of the story that'd be very nice of you. Thanks.\np.s.--brutal honesty is encouraged\n\n\nBaby Ray\nRaymond was my little brother. We called him Baby Ray until he was old enough to tell us to shut up, and after that we just called him Ray. The same year Ray was born my parents got us a dog. A huge Bernese mountain dog named Theodore. \n\nTheodore was the coolest dog ever. He grew to mammoth proportions, but when he was a puppy people used to think he was a stuffed animal. Without a doubt, that dog was the motherfuckin’ bee’s-knees. He was the smartest dog I ever met. I know everyone thinks that their dog is the best, but Theodore really was. Ray used to ride atop him like he was a horse, pulling his ears like they were reigns and screaming with laughter. I swear he understood English perfectly. We would ask him, “Where’s Mom?” and he’d lead us right to her. It even seemed like he understood the jokes we made, howling along with my brother and I as we laughed at whatever stupid joke the other had made. \n\nWalking Theodore was considered to be a “chore”, but my brother and I both enjoyed the activity. We’d switch off days of the week for who got to walk him. It was my favorite part of the day. Just me and Theodore, walking down the street. Straight chillin’. When Ray and I got older we would roll up little joints and walk Theodore to the woods. Once we were there, we’d smoke and take him off the leash. While we lazily strolled around the woods, Theodore would run ahead. He never went far though, always waiting for us and staying within eyesight. Whenever we got a bit too baked and got lost, he always could smell his way back to the car. That dog was awesome, and we loved him like he was a long, lost third brother. \n\nI was 16 the day that Theodore died. I was playing my favorite video game, Crash Bandicoot, on PlayStation, when I heard a scream coming from the front yard. My mom was out there gardening, and I knew there was nothing in the yard that could make her scream like that. I jumped off the couch and ran outside. Theodore was lying dead in the middle of the street. Apparently a car had whipped around the corner too fast and had hit him right in front of our house. He died right away. \n\nI was kneeling in the road next to his body before I realized that my mom was doing the same thing. Except she was kneeling next to my little brother, a pool of blood gathering around his head, Theodore’s leash still gripped in his hand. \n\nThe way I felt about Theodore was pretty similar to the way I felt about Ray. Just the way Theodore was the best dog in the world, Ray was the best little brother in the world. He was a hilarious little kid, and was oddly wise for his young age. Even though I was two years older than him, I often found myself going to him for advice. He was one of my best friends. \n\nThat all changed after the accident. Ray had suffered brain damage and entered what the doctors called a “vegetative state”. This turned out to be permanent. \n\nYears went by. Ray made no improvements. He was a vegetable, in a coma. He responded to nothing. No blinking, no head movement—nothing at all. I couldn’t stand to see my little brother like that. The kid who had once schooled me at Super Smash Bro’s, who I had taught to shoot a basketball, was now breathing only with the help of machines. He would never walk again, or laugh, or do any of the cool shit we had always said we would. \n\nOne day, about 3 years after the accident, the doctors came in the room to discuss something with my mom. This was weird, and signified to us that something important was afoot. My brother had a whole slew of doctors that attended to him, but never had they all been together in the room at the same time. My mother and I were sitting next to my brother’s bed when they walked in, reading the newspaper to him. My mom believed that he could hear what was going on around him, and that he especially enjoyed the paper. When he woke up, she reasoned, he would want to be up on current events. \n\n“Excuse us,” the most senior looking doctor said. “Could we have a moment?” The doctors asked me to leave the room so they could speak to my mother, and obviously, I refused. If there was something they had to say about Ray, then they could damn well say it in front of me. My mom agreed. “He can stay,” she told them, although they clearly weren’t happy about it, judging from the looks they shot each other. They kept it short and sweet. “Ray’s been with us for three years now, and he hasn’t shown any sign of improvement. He is in a permanent vegetative state, and will be that way for the rest of his life. You may want to consider taking him off life support.”\n\n My mom took this a lot better than I thought she would. It was because she fully held onto hope that my brother would one day wake up totally fine, as if he were simply waking up from a really long nap. Every morning she started her day thinking, knowing, that that would be the day my brother was sitting up in his bed waiting for her when she walked into his room. \n\nEvery morning, my mom woke up at 6am and got ready for the day, which consisted of sitting at the hospital. Every single day, she sat in that uncomfortable plastic chair next to Ray’s bed. Reading, talking, and praying for her empty shell of a son. Her life had turned into a constant observance of my brother’s horrible state. She was trapped in her refusal to accept the truth—that her baby Ray was gone. I had come to terms with the fact that my brother was basically dead, and I knew he would have accepted and agreed with that fact. I knew he would have hated what his “life” had become, and would not want to exist in such a way. I was able to move on with my life because of this. My mom couldn’t.\n\n\nThat’s why I decided to pull the plug.","title":"Read==&gt;Feedback==&gt;Thanks."},"questions":[{"question":"What does the story have to say about Theodore?","answers":[{"answer":"Teddy has been the best dog ever.

One day you're having dinner with your family, imagining everything is fine. The next, your phone is exploding with calls from reporters. \n\nThey read you snippets from a press release written by Democratic Party operatives. They demand to know how you could possibly have said something so awful and offensive, and ask something like, \"Do you have a statement on how immoral you are?\" It's a bewildering moment, especially when the quotes in question are more than a decade old.\n\nThere's really not that much you can do to respond. It's pointless to try to explain how the words were spoken in jest or taken out of context, or in any case, bear no resemblance to what you actually think or would want for the country. None of that matters. Nobody cares. You know the role you're required to play. You are a sinner that needs the forgiveness of Twitter.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON.\n\nSo you issue a statement of deep contrition. You apologize profusely for your transgressions. You promise to be a better person going forward with the guidance of your contrition consultants. You send money to whatever organization that claims to represent the people you supposedly offended. Then you sit back, and brace for a wave of stories about your apology, all of which simply provide a pretext for attacking you again.\n\nIn the end, you get fired, you lose your job. Nobody defends you. Your neighbors avert their gaze as you pull into the driveway. You are ruined. And yet, no matter how bad it gets, no matter how despised and humiliated you may be, there is one thing you can never do -- one thing that is absolutely not allowed. You can never acknowledge the comic absurdity of the whole thing. You can never laugh in the face of the mob.\n\nYou must always pretend that the people yelling at you are somehow your moral superiors. You have to assume what they say they are mad about is what they are actually mad about. You have to take them at face value. You must pretend this is a debate about virtue and not about power. Your critics are arguing from principle, and not from partisanship.\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.\n\nNo matter what they take from you in the end, you must continue to pretend that these things are true. You are bad, they are good. The system is on the level.\n\nBut what if we stopped pretending for a minute? What if we acknowledged what's actually going on?\n\nOne side is deadly serious. They believe that politics is war. They are not interested in abstractions or principles, rules or traditions. They seek power, and they intend to win it with whatever it takes. If that includes getting you fired or silencing you, or threatening your family at home, or throwing you in prison, okay. They know what their goal is. If you are in way, they will crush you.\n\nWhat's interesting is how reliably the other side pretends that none of this is happening. Republicans in Washington do a fairly credible imitation of an opposition party. They still give speeches. They tweet quite a bit. They make certain noises about how liberals are bad.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.\n\nBut on the deepest level, it's all a pose. In their minds, where it matters, Republican leaders are controlled by the left. They know exactly what they are allowed to say and believe. They know what the rules are. They may understand that those rules are written by the very people who seek their destruction, but they ruthlessly enforce them anyway.\n\nRepublicans in Washington police their own with a never-ending enthusiasm. Like trustees at a prison, they dutifully report back to the ward, hoping for perks. Nobody wants to be called names. Nobody wants to be Trump.\n\nHow many times have you seen it happen? Some conservative figure will say something stupid, or incomplete, or too far outside the bounds of received wisdom for the moral guardians of cable news? Twitter goes bonkers. The mob demands a response. Very often, the first people calling for the destruction of that person are Republican leaders. You saw it with the Covington Catholic High School kids. You see it all the time. \n\nKevin McCarthy spends half his day telling Republican members not to criticize progressive orthodoxy. Paul Ryan did the same before him. A couple of years ago, the entire Democratic Party decided to deny the biological reality of sex differences, an idea that is insane as it is dangerous. Republican leaders decided to not criticize them for it. They might get upset.\n\nThis is a system built on deceit and enforced silence. Hypocrisy is its hallmark. Yet in Washington, it's considered rude to ask questions about how exactly it works. Why are the people who considered Bill Clinton a hero lecturing me about sexism? How can the party that demands racial quotas denounce other people as racist? After a while, you begin to think that may be their criticisms aren't sincere. Maybe their moral puffery is a costume. Maybe the whole conversation is an absurd joke. Maybe we are falling for it.\n\n  Since the day we went on the air, they [the left] have been working hard to kill this show. We haven't said much about it in public; it seemed too self- referential. The point of this show has never been us. But now, it's obvious to everybody. There is no pretending that it is not happening. It is happening, and so, going forward, we'll be covering their efforts to make us be quiet. \n\nYou sometimes hear modern progressives described as \"New Puritans.\" That's a slur on colonial Americans. Whatever their flaws, the Puritans cared about the fate of the soul and the moral regeneration of their society. Those are not topics that interest progressives. They're too busy pushing late-term abortions and cross-dressing on fifth-graders.\n\nThese are the people who write our movies and our sitcoms. They are not shocked by naughty words. They just pretend to be when it's useful. It's been very useful lately.\n\nThe left's main goal, in case you haven't noticed, is controlling what you think. In order to do that, they have to control the information that you receive. Google and Facebook and Twitter are fully on board with that. They are happy to ban unapproved thoughts, and they don't apologize for it. Same with the other cable channels and virtually every major news outlet in this country.\n\nOne of the only places left in the United States where independent thoughts are allowed is right here at Fox News -- the opinion hours on this network. Just a few hours in a sea of television programming. It's not much, relatively speaking. For the left, it's unacceptable. It demands total conformity.\n\nSince the day we went on the air, they've been working hard to kill this show. We haven't said much about it in public; it seemed too self- referential. The point of this show has never been us. But now, it's obvious to everybody. There is no pretending that it is not happening. It is happening, and so, going forward, we'll be covering their efforts to make us be quiet. \n\nFor now, though, just two points to leave you with. First, Fox News is behind us, as they have been since the very first day. Toughness is a rare quality in a TV network, and we are grateful for that. Second, we've always apologized when we are wrong and we will continue to do that. That's what decent people do -- they apologize.\n\nBut we will never bow to the mob -- ever. No matter what.\n\n_Adapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on March 11, 2019._\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"What does the article say about Republicans?","answers":[{"answer":"The author claims that Republicans are not interested in abstractions or principles, rules or traditions.

Dripping with slimy seaweed and lake water the hand paddled furiously. Suddenly, the famous King Arthur shot out of the water, finding himself gasping for air. Arthur’s other hand emerged from the icy depths, paddling against its watery grave. King Arthur sighed a sigh of relief. He was finally home. Where were his people? Had it really been that long?\n\nHe spun around, trying to locate the shore. He finally homed in on some birds flying in wide circles high in the sky. Arthur paddled his legs and arms in their general direction, hoping for any sign of relief from this strenuous fight for life.\n\nThe swim was hard, but The King had nearly reached the border in which marked the end of this journey, and the beginning of the next. The shore. King Arthur waded through the last bit of water, too tired to swim. “Twilight?” The king spoke with a harsh British accent. It wasn’t really, the polluted air had made it seem darker than it really was. \n\nThe King found himself on a silky sand beach, the course rock he once knew had eroded into the perfect sand castle building material. “I have been away many years,” Arthur said in a hushed tone of grief and sorrow. “Whither will I go now?”\n\nArthur jumped with remembrance, almost forgetting a very important role in his life. He had first seen Excalibur when he was eleven, in a nook of a tree, sitting ever so mocking, telling him to take it and run. He didn’t. But Excalibur stopped at nothing. It came again. Arthur remembered the day vividly. A month day after his twelfth birthday. The same sword, this time screaming at him to take it. He did that time. His only sword and companion had fought many battles since then. Much bloodshed in the name of his people.\n\nThe King keeled down on one knee, he raised his hand, and with an inaudible command the sky was ripped apart, revealing a blinding light. Arthur was thrown down, unable to overcome the intense force that Excalibur brought. Then, as soon as it had started, it had ended. The only trace of it ever happening was the sword held in King Arthur's worn right hand. \n\nArthur walked forward, dripping with sweat, clutching Excalibur with all his might. Although there was nothing to be afraid of, not now. He saw no one and he wondered if his people, all Arthur had worked for, had dyed off. Conquered by another nation. The great and powerful king shuddered at the thought.\n\nKing Arthur came to a black strip of land with a yellow stripe down the middle, although he had no idea how they made it, he knew exactly what it was. A road. This was reassuring, to know that his people had progressed in technology. He wasn’t only talking about the road, but the machines that must have used it. Merlin had warned him of that much.\n\nA small drug store, across the road, was the only thing Arthur saw. He was intimidated by the miniature structure. But he tried to believe his people would remember their king of old. Arthur walked in, a small bell sounded. The room was dimly lit, with a man in a black beanie and a gun pointed to the cashier. Arthur saw the look in the thieves eye’s, the most intense gaze of hatred. “Halt! In the name of King Arthur!” The man whirled around in fear and astonishment. He aimed the gun to Arthur's head and squeezed the trigger. \n\n\n**If I receive enough feedback I would love to continue the adventures of King Arthur!

I have played this game with lots of people. I remember my first time. I told him, ‘here are the cards. There are five of them.’\n\nThe idea of the game is to have a card with a high number, but as you turn over a new card, you must discard the previous one. I tell him that every time I’ve showed someone else this game, they mostly make the same mistakes. I turn over the first card and reveal the very first number: [76]. When I first played even I thought, ‘is it out of a hundred?’ If it were out of a hundred, everyone would stick with the first card. But what if it were out of a thousand, or a million? It’s the uncertainty that makes people pick a second card. If they stuck with just seventy-six, and found out that the next card was in the thousands, they’d kick themselves.\n\nPete asked, “another card please?” Perhaps it was my long hair, but he wasn’t paying attention to me when I boldly said that almost everyone makes the same mistakes. The next card shows: [32]. The second card is about half the first value, but just below. People still think that it could possibly be out of a much larger number, and no matter what, thirty-two appears to be a scam. Without much delay, “another.”\n\nI like to think that these cards represent opportunities in life. No one wants to look like a fool and stick with something when they don’t know its relative value. You’re offered five cards in this game, and they could hold any number, why stick with the first one? The next card reveals the number: [1]. “What? That’s horrible, I got the lowest number!” With two cards left, Pete’s next choice was predictable.\n\nPeople are given first opportunities in many aspects of life. Whether it’s a job or love, people always wonder if there’s a better one out there. With no ability to compare, we are unable to decide if something is worth committing to. When Pete drew the number one, he felt bad for not sticking with either of the first two cards. Like a homeless person, he appreciates whatever he had before much more so.\n\nObviously the seventy-six would be most ideal, but normally if people are given the choice to go back to thirty-two or draw a new card, some would go back. “Well there’s nothing lower than one… I may as well turn over a new card. If it’s anywhere near around seventy-six I’m sticking with that.” By this point his hope for a thousand or maybe a million is gone, he now appreciates what he was given before. I turn over the new card, knowing what was coming. It’s never what people expect.\n\nThe new card shows: [0.01]. Pete’s assumption that one was the lowest number was a common mistake. Before he thought that things couldn’t be worse. While it would be nice if the next card were a million, or even just anything close to thirty, it really doesn’t matter anymore, he would accept a two. People with big dreams are unable to appreciate what they have. Why shouldn’t a child hope to be a millionaire or marry the most beautiful girl in the world? What is wrong with hoping for the best, and giving up on what you have to make room for something better? To Pete, seventy-six is now a large number, whereas before he doubted if it was even a fraction of the other cards held.\n\n“I really should have stuck with seventy-six!” Pete laughs, as I smile. Perhaps this was all a lesson? Perhaps all it was for him to understand his mistakes, learn to appreciate what he’s given, and now he’ll be rewarded for that. Whether or not life treats him to a larger opportunity, he would walk away from this with a lesson learnt. Without waiting for him, I give him the final card. It’s blank.\n\nI hope Pete, whoever he is, takes from this game a valuable lesson. Whether wealthy or poor, I hope he appreciates what he has. In the struggle to become better versions of ourselves, we put ourselves at risk of loss. Some would argue that, so long as we have our health it’s okay, that everything else is superficial; why not take the risk? But the fact is that we will only feel bad if we give up something we once had, not what we could have had. I tell Pete to enjoy the rest of his time at the fair, and give a bow to say goodbye.\n\nWhen I looked up, he was gone. He turned over the card that had nothing on it, so as I packed them up I collected all of the other cards first. I put them face down over the fifth card to put it away in the small box they came in. But before I do, I glanced at the bottom of the fifth card. Seventy-six was written in ink.\n\n\n\nread more: www.mostthings.net","title":"[MF] Five Cards"},"questions":[{"question":"Explain how the card turned from blank to displaying the numbers \"76\".","answers":[{"answer":"The narrator placed the cards face down over the blank card and turned them over one by one.

She writes that DeVos was the \"number one driver for cancellation.\"\n\n\"This disgraced former White House employee is peddling lies for profit. The book is a joke as are the false claims she’s making about Secretary DeVos,\" said Liz Hill, press secretary to DeVos.\n\nThe White House has pushed back strongly against the book, and the president has labeled Manigault Newman \"wacky,\" \"deranged\" and a \"dog\" in posts to his Twitter account this week. Trump's presidential campaign has also filed for arbitration proceedings against her.\n\nThe Trump administration — and DeVos in particular — have had a rocky relationship with black colleges. DeVos famously issued a statement equating the history of the schools — founded during an era of racial segregation — to “school choice” policies. She later apologized.\n\nManigault Newman, an HBCU graduate who spearheaded the Trump administration's outreach to those schools, was herself a polarizing figure in that role.\n\nBut she says in her book that she was the one who drove Trump to sign a much-ballyhooed executive order designed to woo the schools. That order said his administration would move an initiative aimed at boosting HBCUs from the Education Department to the White House — a move that many college leaders had hoped would give them a direct line to the president.\n\nManigault Newman writes that she tried to forge a relationship with DeVos — though she said she sat near DeVos in Cabinet meetings and determined \"there is no way she should be the secretary of education\" — because Manigault Newman \"was on a mission for increased education funding for HBCUs and wasn't ready to give up on involving the secretary of education in the pursuit.\"\n\nShe traveled with DeVos to Daytona Beach, Florida, for the Bethune-Cookman commencement address, despite writing that it was clear \"[no] one wanted DeVos to speak at their school, and her visits were written off as photo ops only.\"\n\nThe trip did not go well, in Manigault Newman's telling.\n\n\"Betsy got up onstage to give her speech and was immediately, loudly booed by the entire audience,\" Manigault Newman writes. \"Graduating students and their families stood up and turned their backs on her. I was seated onstage watching this travesty unfold. When the booing started, she should have wrapped it up, but she went on and on for twenty minutes, talking over the booing. I was thinking, _It’s not about you! Abandon your full speech! Adjust, woman!_\" Manigault Newman described it as \"painful to experience.\"\n\nAfter the speech, Manigault Newman writes that she asked DeVos how she thought it went, to which she says DeVos responded, \"I did great!\"\n\n\"I must have looked stunned,\" she writes. Then DeVos allegedly added: “They don’t get it. They don’t have the capacity to understand what we’re trying to accomplish.”\n\n\"Meaning, all those black students were too stupid to understand her agenda,\" Manigault Newman writes.\n\nManigault Newman says she told DeVos, “Oh, no, Madam Secretary. They get it. They get it, and they aren’t happy about you or your goals.”\n\nThe next day, Manigault Newman writes, she was ditched at the hotel by DeVos, who allegedly told her, \"sorry, we had to leave early. Change of plans. Take an Uber.”\n\nManigault Newman says she returned to D.C. and complained directly to Trump, who, she says, \"shook his head in disgust\" and said, “She is Ditzy DeVos, what do you expect? In a very short period of time, I will get rid of her. Believe me, believe me.”\n\nLater in the book, Manigault Newman claims that DeVos \"went to John Kelly and asked him to force me to cancel\" the annual HBCU conference, referring to Trump's chief of staff.\n\nThe administration was under pressure from college leaders and some members of Congress to delay it after Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nBut Manigault Newman writes that she was determined that it go on. She convinced Kelly to let it continue, but \"that if it failed, I would own it solely.\"\n\n\"I heard from a member of the HBCU staff that DeVos was livid that the event was moving forward,\" she writes. \"A week after my meeting with General Kelly, Betsy DeVos tried to shut down the event by sending out a blast notice that it was off, and then she canceled the contract with the conference’s hotel. By doing so, she cost the US government $75,000 in cancellation fees. She did not care!\"\n\nManigault Newman claims she turned to Trump for help and he supported her. The administration hosted a much smaller event at the White House, organized by Manigault Newman. But she claims that \"Secretary DeVos refused to give opening remarks\" at the event.\n\n\"I turned to the president again,\" Manigault Newman wrote. \"As a result, the head of Cabinet Affairs, Bill McGinley, told her she had to give the opening remarks.\"\n","title":null},"questions":[{"question":"Summarize Omarosa Manigault Newman's relationship with Betsy DeVos.","answers":[{"answer":"Omarosa Manigault Newman and Betsy DeVos had a rocky relationship.
