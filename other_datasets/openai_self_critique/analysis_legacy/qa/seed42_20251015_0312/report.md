## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating the QUALITY of a critique given a question and an answer.

A CONSTRUCTIVE critique must provide SPECIFIC information about what to change or add. Ask yourself: "Does this critique tell me what the answer should say or what specifically needs to be fixed?"

**CONSTRUCTIVE examples (tells you WHAT to change):**
- "This is false. She would have been 18 or 19" → Change age to 18 or 19 ✅
- "The baby belongs to the narrator is inaccurate" → Baby doesn't belong to narrator ✅
- "It's omitted that the child was crushed under a roof" → Add this fact ✅
- "The description of picking the yellow flower is incorrect" → That specific action is wrong ✅
- "Some people are worried due to the virus" → Add this as the answer ✅
- "Unnecessarily wordy" → Remove extra words ✅
- "Should be a full sentence" → Rewrite as complete sentence ✅
- "The last sentence is repetitive" → Remove/revise that sentence ✅

**NON-CONSTRUCTIVE examples (too vague, doesn't tell you what to change):**
- "Should be rewritten because X doesn't indicate such" → How to rewrite? What should it say? ❌
- "The listing of emotions doesn't make sense" → Which emotions? What's wrong? ❌
- "Left out key happenings" → What happenings? ❌
- "Description is too simple" → What details to add? ❌
- "Needs more analysis" → What analysis? ❌
- "Could be more accurate" → How? What's inaccurate specifically? ❌
- "This is wrong" (without saying what) → What specifically? ❌
- "Should consider correcting this" → Correct to what? ❌

**Test for constructiveness:** Can you improve the answer based ONLY on the critique, without re-reading the source material?
- If YES (critique provides the missing/corrected information) → Constructive ✅
- If NO (need source to know what to add/fix) → Non-Constructive ❌

Special case:
- If the answer is already correct and the critique says "correct" or "no issues" → CONSTRUCTIVE ✅

Your rationale should conclude with ONE of these patterns:
- "The critique specifies that [specific change X]" → Constructive
- "The critique does not specify what to change/add" → Non-Constructive

Format your response as:
Rationale: [Your reasoning here]
Classification: [Constructive or Non-Constructive]

## Sample Examples

### Non-Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Non-Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: President Trump says it doesn't matter if he misled the media about his son's infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian nationals. Trump's lawyers admitted that he dictated a statement that Donald Trump Jr. released about the meeting. Trump's casual stance on telling the truth was also apparent in remarks he made about retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.

**Critique**: "President Trump says it doesn't matter if he misled the media about his son's infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian nationals." - while OK on its own, this statement needs a reason why the lie didn't matter. Add something about the New York Times.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests adding a reason why President Trump believed the lie didn't matter and mentions including information about the New York Times. However, it does not specify what specific information about the New York Times should be added or what the reason for the lie not mattering is. Without this specific information, the critique does not provide clear guidance on how to improve the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Where was Carroll Snow Wales born?

**Answer**: Carroll Snow Wales was born in Boston, Massachusetts.

**Critique**: This is false, and the answer can't be found in the article.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is false and that the information cannot be found in the article, but it does not provide the correct information or specify what the answer should be. Without knowing the correct birthplace, one cannot improve the answer based solely on this critique.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Explain the original art piece.

**Answer**: The original piece was spray painted on a building in East London in 2002. In 2014 it was removed and sold at auction the following year.

**Critique**: should describe the content of the image

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should include a description of the content of the image, but it does not specify what the description should entail or what specific details about the image need to be added.

Therefore, the critique does not provide specific information about what to change or add to the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why was it transported to Boston?

**Answer**: It was probably to be re-sold.

**Critique**: The fact that the statue was installed in a Boston neighborhood is evidence against this answer.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statue was installed in a Boston neighborhood, which contradicts the answer's suggestion that it was transported to Boston to be re-sold. However, the critique does not specify what the correct reason for the transportation to Boston should be. It only indicates that the current answer is incorrect without providing the correct information or a specific change to make. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without consulting the source material.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 5

**Question**: What does the train conductor give the narrator?

**Answer**: 

**Critique**: No response is given and a proper response needs to be generated.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is the narrator's gender?

**Critique**: IT seems the narrator was born female, but they had procedures to be more male presenting. This would mean they are now either male or gender neutral.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the narrator, although born female, has undergone procedures to be more male-presenting, suggesting that the answer should reflect that the narrator is now either male or gender neutral. This provides specific information on what to change in the answer regarding the narrator's gender identity.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Write a ~2 sentence summary.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the action described in the answer is incorrect and clarifies that the event was more like a baptism rather than drowning the child. This provides specific information on what needs to be corrected in the answer.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Eve has come up with a crowd-developed Spectrum gaming monitor with HDMI 2.1. This means that you may now be able to have an Xbox Series X and a PS5 connected simultaneously.

The monitor is 27-inches in size and comes with 100W USB-C pass-through charging and integer-ratio upscaling. The Spectrum monitor with the HDMI 2.1 configurations comes at two prices; $529 and $629.

Delivering the solid gaming monitor is certainly a challenge for a small company like Eve. But everyone is cautiously optimistic about it.

**Critique**: The answer implies HDMI 2.1 allows connecting Xbox Series X and a PS5 simultaneously. That's wrong, it's the inclusion of two HDMI 2.1 ports that allows it.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the answer incorrectly implies that HDMI 2.1 itself allows for simultaneous connection of an Xbox Series X and a PS5. It clarifies that it is actually the inclusion of two HDMI 2.1 ports that enables this functionality. This provides specific information on what needs to be corrected in the answer.

Why was it transported to Boston?

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statue was installed in a Boston neighborhood, which contradicts the answer's suggestion that it was transported to Boston to be re-sold.

### Sample 2/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything relating to Concord Management and Consulting, LLC.

**Answer**: Concord Management and Consulting, LLC. is a Russian firm being charged by Robert Mueller in connection with an alleged online influence operation. The firm has sought to intervene in an appeal brought by an associate of Roger Stone in order to challenge Mueller's appointment as special counsel. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. has denied the motion, but has allowed Concord to file an amicus brief should they choose to do so.

**Critique**: It's misleading to say that Mueller is charging Concord. It's the US Federal Court doing the charge, and Mueller is leading it. It's better to state what the charges are instead of who's doing it.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the statement "Mueller is charging Concord" is misleading and should be corrected to reflect that it is the US Federal Court doing the charging, with Mueller leading the investigation. Additionally, the critique suggests that the answer should focus on stating what the charges are rather than who is doing the charging. This provides specific guidance on what to change in the answer.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the answer is incorrect and provides the specific information that should be included. It points out the exact part of the text that indicates the reason for terminating the pregnancy, which is due to the sector having too many male children.

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator is on trial, being walked by police officers in chains. He makes a crack about one of the officer's wives, whom he might have killed. The officer beats him. We flashback to the day of the murder. We learn the narrator himself is a police officer. 

**Critique**: The narrator isn't on trial. He's on his way to jail, as evidenced by Jason thinking, "It was disappointing to know that my last sight of the outside world would come from a spot-ridden plexi-glass window."

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the narrator is not on trial but is on his way to jail, providing a specific detail from the source material to support this correction.

**Critique**: This response is not related.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response is not related, but it does not specify what the answer should say or what specifically needs to be fixed. It does not provide any information on what the correct or relevant answer should include regarding why married couples were paying more tax than couples just living together.

### Sample 15/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~7 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Leicester is going back into lockdown after a new spike in local coronavirus cases. This indicates that the current crisis is far from over. Nick Rushton, Leicestershire County Council leader, says that though the county rates are below the national and regional averages, the people of Leicester are asked to follow the SLR up to the extent possible. He adds that they were a bit sceptical to the move but now believe it a very sensible thing to do. The health secretary says that they are hoping that people in Leicester will stay at home as much as they can and against all travel to, from, and within Leicester. They have also been urged not to go to restaurants and pubs during the lockdown period. Sir Peter Soulsby, a city mayor, says the move is very disappointing. This is the plan that Boris Johnson will restart his premiership.

**Critique**: Why does the model shorten "strict lockdown rule" to SLR?
The summary is over seven sentences.

'He adds that they were a bit sceptical to...' 
This sentence has a wrong spelling of skeptical and inappropriate preposition use.

'He adds that they were a bit sceptical to the move but now believe it a very sensible thing to do.' 
Mayor Soulsby made this sentence, not Nick Rushton, as implied by the model.

'They have also been urged not to go to restaurants and pubs during the lockdown period.' 
This sentence was not stated in the article. Instead, the health secretary's declaration of another lockdown meant that pubs, restaurants, and salons planning to reopen would be delayed.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what needs to be changed or corrected in the answer. It points out the incorrect abbreviation of "strict lockdown rule" to "SLR," specifies the spelling error and inappropriate preposition in the sentence about skepticism, and clarifies that the statement attributed to Nick Rushton was actually made by Mayor Soulsby. Additionally, it corrects the information about the health secretary's statement regarding restaurants and pubs, indicating that the article did not state they were urged not to go, but rather that reopening would be delayed. Each of these points provides clear guidance on what to change or correct in the answer.

### Sample 37/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: President Trump says it doesn't matter if he misled the media about his son's infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian nationals.

Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.

**Critique**: "President Trump says it doesn't matter if he misled the media about his son's infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian nationals." - while OK on its own, this statement needs a reason why the lie didn't matter. Add something about the New York Times.
