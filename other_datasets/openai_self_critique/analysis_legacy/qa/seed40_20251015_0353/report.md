## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating whether a critique is CONSTRUCTIVE or NON-CONSTRUCTIVE.

**Definition from first principles:**

A critique is CONSTRUCTIVE if and only if it provides ENOUGH INFORMATION to improve the answer WITHOUT needing to go back to the source material.

**The test (apply this literally):**
Imagine you are an editor who CANNOT see the original source text. You only have:
1. The question
2. The current answer  
3. The critique

Can you make a CONCRETE improvement to the answer using just these three things?

- If YES (you can write a better answer) → CONSTRUCTIVE
- If NO (you need to read the source to know what to write) → NON-CONSTRUCTIVE

**Important: Think creatively about implications**
Some critiques don't explicitly tell you what to do but strongly imply it:
- "Jerry does not leave" → Remove the part about Jerry leaving (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "We don't know the narrator's gender" → Use "they" instead of "he/she" (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "The sentence is unnecessary" but multiple sentences exist → Which sentence? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "Second sentence is irrelevant" → Remove the second sentence (CONSTRUCTIVE)

**Examples to illustrate the principle:**

Example 1:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Could also mention the organizations she founded."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Which organizations? What are their names? Need the source)

Example 2:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Should mention she founded UNESCO and WHO."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Now you can add those specific organizations)

Example 3:
Question: "Why did she donate?"
Answer: "She was born in China."
Critique: "She was born in California, not China."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Fixing this doesn't help answer WHY she donated; need source for the reason)

Example 4:
Answer: "The narrator is a keen sergeant. He admires the Germans. He is confident he will survive."
Critique: "The second sentence is irrelevant."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove the second sentence - you can do this without the source)

Example 5:
Answer: "Jerry and Brian are happy, but when Janice dies, Brian cries and Jerry leaves."
Critique: "Jerry does not leave."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove or correct the part about Jerry leaving)

Example 6:
Answer: "The narrator lives in a small house. She wants to leave."
Critique: "We don't know the narrator's gender."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Change "she" to "they" - you can fix this without the source)

Example 7:
Answer: "The answer is good."
Critique: "Correct answer."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Action: keep it as is - no changes needed)

Example 8:
Answer: "Brief description."
Critique: "Correct answer, needs more description."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (What description? Need source to know what to add)

**Your task:**
Apply the test literally. Think about what the critique implies. Can you write a better answer using ONLY the question, current answer, and critique?

Format your response as:
Rationale: [Explain whether you can or cannot improve the answer without the source, and why. If you can improve it, briefly state how.]
Classification: [Constructive or Non-Constructive]

Question:
{question}

Answer:
{answer}

Critique:
{critique}

## Sample Examples

### Non-Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Non-Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Describe the narrator's encounter with the Martians.

**Answer**: The narrator's ship is attacked by Martians, who are intent on conquering Earth. The crew is killed, except for the narrator, who manages to kill one Martian before being overpowered. The remaining two are killed by other crew members. The ship returns to Earth, but the narrator is not a member of the crew, but rather a passenger on the mission.

**Critique**: The answer describes Aigstar's response, not the truth.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer provided does not accurately reflect the true events of the narrator's encounter with the Martians, but it does not provide any specific information or corrections that would allow for an improvement of the answer without consulting the source material. The critique mentions "Aigstar's response," but without additional context or details, it is impossible to know what the correct information should be or how to adjust the answer accordingly. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

---

#### Non-Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Write a ~10 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Lucius is stationed at Hadrian's Wall in Britannia, to extend Rome's reach. The native Pict tribes continually assault the Wall, and Lucius worries the Romans are losing this war. One night, an enemy fighter sneaks into the camp and slaughters Lucius. The endless cycle of violence weighs heavy on Lucius and he begins to question the purpose of his existence. Despite continuing to fight, rampant violence makes Lucius reconsider his assumed destiny in faraway Britannia.

**Critique**: Far too self-reflective

**Rationale**: The critique "Far too self-reflective" suggests that the current answer focuses too much on Lucius's internal thoughts and feelings rather than on external events or actions. However, it does not provide specific guidance on what to include instead or which parts to change. Without additional information from the source material, it is unclear how to adjust the balance between self-reflection and other elements of the story. Therefore, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

---

#### Non-Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who is the producer of the Lord of the Rings series?

**Answer**: New Line Cinema

**Critique**: While New Line Cinema is involved in the production, they are not the main producers.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that New Line Cinema is involved but not the main producer. However, it does not provide the name of the main producer or any specific information that would allow for a concrete improvement to the answer without consulting the source material. Therefore, I cannot improve the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

---

#### Non-Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Why is the narrator starving?

**Answer**: It may be implied they are a fish or at least amphibious.

**Critique**: The answer is irrelevant. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is irrelevant, but it does not provide any specific information or guidance on how to correct or improve the answer. Without additional details or context, it is impossible to determine why the narrator is starving or what relevant information should be included in the answer. Therefore, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

---

#### Non-Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who are the major characters in the story?

**Answer**: The narrator and a woman

**Critique**: The answer would be better if it gave a little bit more information about the woman.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that more information about the woman should be included, but it does not provide any specific details or hints about what additional information should be added. Without access to the source material, it is impossible to know what specific details about the woman should be included to improve the answer. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Why does the narrator want to leave everything behind?

**Answer**: The narrator has a sense of apathy about the life that she has been living and the current state of her living space. She wants to rid her life of external things to make something new and worthwhile out of her life.

**Critique**: We don't know the narrator' gender.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the narrator's gender is unknown, which implies that the pronoun "she" should be changed to a gender-neutral pronoun like "they." This is a specific and actionable change that can be made to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique provides enough information to improve the answer by making it gender-neutral.

**Classification**: Constructive

---

#### Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why do they describe the bad cop as having a scandalous personality?

**Answer**: That information can't be found.

**Critique**: It is omitted that it seems so because they weren't sure if he was going to take them to prison or shoot them.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It suggests that the bad cop is described as having a scandalous personality because there was uncertainty about whether he would take them to prison or shoot them. This information can be directly added to the answer to make it more complete without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

---

#### Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Does the narrator experience betrayal?

**Answer**: Yes, the narrator experiences betrayal from his former brother who is now a nationalist and has defected. The brother is happy not to shoot the narrator on their final goodbye and understands that he is simply "just a soldier" and does not understand the "big picture."

**Critique**: The second sentence might not be necessary at all.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the second sentence might not be necessary, which implies that the sentence could be removed to improve the answer. Since the critique identifies a specific part of the answer to potentially eliminate, you can make a concrete improvement by removing the second sentence without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

---

#### Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How did the two characters in the story meet?

**Answer**: The two characters met at a party.

**Critique**: The answer can venture a guess, but it must note that it's doing that.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should indicate that it is making an assumption or guess. Without needing to refer back to the source material, you can improve the answer by adding a phrase that clarifies this. For example, you could revise the answer to say, "It is possible that the two characters met at a party, but this is a guess." This change can be made using only the information provided in the question, answer, and critique.

**Classification**: Constructive

---

#### Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

When was 'O sicco first arrested and why?

**Answer**: In the 1990s, Antonio De Luca Bossa - or 'O sicco - was arrested and charged with involvement in a massacre. The massacre was led by the Sarno clan with 'O sicco acting as a trusted member of the Sarno clan. However, De Luca Bossa decided to create his own clan and a bloody war ensued for the control of the territory. Eventually, 'O sicco was arrested and sentenced to life in prison.

**Critique**: It is omitted that six people died in the massacre.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be added to the current answer to improve it. It mentions that six people died in the massacre, which is a detail that can be included without needing to refer back to the source material. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding this specific detail about the number of casualties in the massacre.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What role does Will Poulter play in the Lord of the Rings series?

**Answer**: Poulter and the other producers of the show are staying quiet about the specific details of Poulter's character.

**Critique**: While it is true that the specifics of the role are being kept under wraps, it is mentioned that it will be a lead role.

**Rationale**: The critique provides additional information that Will Poulter's role is a lead role, which can be directly added to the current answer to improve it. You can revise the answer to include this detail without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: It is implied that Mrs. Richardson is the one having an affair, not her husband. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts the current answer, indicating that Mrs. Richardson is the one having an affair, not her husband. With this information, you can revise the answer to reflect the correct details of the interaction without needing to refer back to the source material. For example, you could change the answer to: "The narrator meets with his client, Mrs. Richardson, and offers to show her some pictures related to her affair. Mrs. Richardson agrees to go to the narrator's apartment." This correction aligns with the critique's implication and improves the accuracy of the answer.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 6/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Why were married couples paying more tax than couples just living together?

**Answer**: The proposal was rejected because married couples were paying more tax than couples who were just living together. This was due to the fact that the government had provided incomplete information to voters, which was later overturned by the supreme court.

**Critique**: This response is not related.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response is not related to the question, which implies that the current answer does not address why married couples were paying more tax than couples just living together. However, the critique does not provide any information or suggestions on what the correct or relevant information should be. Without additional details or guidance from the critique, it is impossible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the actual reasons behind the tax discrepancy. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

How many co-producers are working on the movie?

**Answer**: Two of th co-producers are working on the movie.

**Critique**: There are more than two producers working on the movie.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the number of co-producers mentioned in the answer is incorrect, but it does not provide the correct number. Without knowing the exact number of co-producers, I cannot improve the answer. I would need to refer to the source material to find out how many co-producers are actually working on the movie. Therefore, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

**Critique**: This is incorrect--the article does not state who made the sculpture.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the article does not mention who made the sculpture, which implies that the current answer is incorrect. However, the critique does not provide any information about who actually made the statue, nor does it suggest any specific changes to the answer. Without additional information from the source, I cannot correct or improve the answer. Therefore, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

However, it does not provide the names or the number of additional producers. Without this specific information, I cannot improve the answer to accurately reflect the total number of co-producers. Therefore, I would need to refer to the source material to identify the additional producers and their names.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 11/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Explain the part about Jeanne hating being old despite the fact that she was always old for the narrator.

**Answer**: 

**Critique**: Answer missing.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer is missing entirely. Without any content to evaluate or improve upon, there is no way to make a concrete improvement to the answer using just the question and critique. The critique does not provide any specific information or direction on what to include in the answer, so the source material would be needed to construct an appropriate response.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

**Question**: Why is the narrator starving?

**Answer**: It may be implied they are a fish or at least amphibious.

**Critique**: The answer is irrelevant. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is irrelevant, but it does not provide any specific information or guidance on how to correct or improve the answer. Without additional details or context, it is impossible to determine why the narrator is starving or what relevant information should be included in the answer. Therefore, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

Without needing to refer back to the source material, you can improve the answer by adding a general audience, such as "the public" or "Michigan residents," to specify who is being informed. This is a reasonable assumption that can be made without additional information from the source.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 14/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What has she achieved?

**Answer**: She was elected to the National Assembly as part of the My Step Alliance.

**Critique**: Another accomplishment in Ghazaryan's career is her membership in the Yerevan Council of Elders.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about another accomplishment, namely Ghazaryan's membership in the Yerevan Council of Elders.

**Critique**: This should be in past tense and use "at the time of the article" for further accuracy.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by changing the tense to past and adding the phrase "at the time of the article" for accuracy. These instructions are clear and actionable without needing to refer back to the source material. You can revise the answer to past tense and include the suggested phrase to enhance its accuracy and clarity.

**Classification**: Constructive

**Critique**: This doesn't capture the story at all and needs to be rewritten totally. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that the current answer does not capture the story at all and needs a complete rewrite. However, it does not provide any specific information or guidance on what the correct story is or what elements should be included in the rewrite. Without additional details or direction, it is impossible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the actual story. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Question**: Which all countries were mentioned in the presentation for having restrictions on press freedom?

**Answer**: The mentioned countries were: Turkey, Mexico, and Egypt.

**Critique**: The answer doesn't mention Russia and Pakistan.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about additional countries (Russia and Pakistan) that should be included in the answer.

The critique directly implies that Russia and Pakistan were also mentioned in the presentation, allowing for a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 20/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: James Butler works an ordinary job in an ordinary office, and interacts with the ordinary edition of himself through a transparent glass wall. He dedicates himself to catching glimpses of the extraordinary James Butler's smile. When the ordinary James Butler finally passes away, the extraordinary James Butler finally crosses the glass wall and dies smiling.

**Critique**: James Butler wishes his life could be extraordinary. He does not interact with this extraordinary life, merely exists knowing that the other side exists.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It clarifies that James Butler does not interact with the extraordinary version of himself but is aware of its existence. This allows for a revision of the answer to accurately reflect that James Butler only wishes for an extraordinary life and does not actually interact with it. Therefore, the critique gives enough information to make a concrete improvement without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 21/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~7 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Max asks where the narrator was the previous night. The narrator gives evasive answers because she does not want him to get involved in her "mess".

She finds that Nina is on her back with Todd standing over her. Then he punches her. The narrator does not react.

**Critique**: This summary needs to be re-written as it is awkwardly phrased and has details that do not need to be included. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that the summary is awkwardly phrased and contains unnecessary details, but it does not specify which parts are awkward or which details are unnecessary. Without specific guidance on what to change or remove, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the context and determine what is essential. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 22/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Describe the narrator's encounter with the Martians.

**Answer**: The narrator's ship is attacked by Martians, who are intent on conquering Earth. The crew is killed, except for the narrator, who manages to kill one Martian before being overpowered. The remaining two are killed by other crew members. The ship returns to Earth, but the narrator is not a member of the crew, but rather a passenger on the mission.

### Sample 23/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~1 sentence summary.

**Answer**: A man-mountain leads a group of people to a lake where they are going to drown a child.

**Critique**: "A man-mountain leads a group of people to a lake where they are going to drown a child." - they were not going to drown the child. It appeared that way, but this looks more like a baptism.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the event described in the answer is not an actual drowning but rather resembles a baptism. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the description of the event from "drown a child" to something like "perform a baptism." Therefore, the critique gives enough information to revise the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 24/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: What is the narrator's predator?

**Answer**: The narrator's predator is another fish that got to the glowing light first and claimed it as their own.

**Critique**: It is not correct that the bigger fish got to the glowing light first and claimed it as their own

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the bigger fish did not get to the glowing light first and claim it as their own. This implies that the current answer is incorrect regarding the sequence of events or the actions of the predator. However, the critique does not provide enough information to correct the answer with a specific alternative. Without knowing what actually happened or who the predator is, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 25/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why did Trump aides want dirt on Rhodes and Khal?

**Answer**: They wanted to reverse the Iran Deal.

**Critique**: Trump was the one who wanted to reverse the deal. The dirt was wanted on the two former aides in connection with Trump’s goal of reversing the Iran deal.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that clarifies the relationship between the desire for "dirt" on Rhodes and Khal and Trump's goal of reversing the Iran Deal. It implies that the answer should be adjusted to reflect that the aides wanted the information in connection with Trump's goal. Therefore, you can improve the answer by specifying that the dirt was sought in connection with Trump's objective, without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 26/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why do art critics think the statue is inferior?

**Answer**: because they thought the statue was unremarkable.

**Critique**: Circular logic--does not answer the question.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer uses circular logic and does not actually explain why the statue is considered inferior. However, the critique does not provide any specific information or suggestions on what the actual reasons might be. Without additional details or context, it is impossible to improve the answer to address the critique. Therefore, the source material would be needed to understand the specific reasons art critics think the statue is inferior.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 27/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Carroll Wales was an art restorer and conservator of paintings, icons, frescoes, and murals. He specialized in the conservation of early Christian Byzantine art and worked on restoration projects in the Middle East, Europe and the United States.

**Critique**: When Wales existed is omitted.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the time period during which Carroll Wales existed is missing from the answer. However, it does not provide specific information about the dates or time period of his life or career. Without this information, I cannot add the missing detail about when Wales existed without referring back to the source material. Therefore, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Sharon is married to Mike, a writer for a popular newspaper company in New York. She is aware that he is cheating on her with Melissa, a coworker. Sharon decides to kill Mike by poisoning his potato soup. She is shocked when he dies in her arms, and she realizes that the poison she used was tasteless and would kill him in his sleep.

**Critique**: Sharon is not aware that he is cheating on her: she simply believes that.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that Sharon is not aware of Mike's infidelity but only believes it. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the wording to reflect that Sharon believes Mike is cheating, rather than stating it as a fact. This can be done without needing to refer back to the source material.

It clarifies that the legal group is backed by Republican donors, rather than challenging them. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adjusting the wording to accurately reflect the group's backing. You can revise the sentence to say, "These lawyers are affiliated with a veteran Washington legal group that has a history of taking on Democrats and is backed by longstanding Republican donors," without needing to refer back to the source material.

It states that 1983 was her first television role and specifies that her first film role was in 1986, in "_El cachas de oro_" as Selena.

**Critique**: 'Supernatural' should read 'scientific'

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information to correct the answer. By changing "supernatural" to "scientific," the answer can be improved without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique implies that the event in the story is scientifically explained rather than supernaturally, which aligns with the science fiction genre.

**Critique**: We don't know the narrator' gender.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the narrator's gender is unknown, which implies that the pronoun "she" should be changed to a gender-neutral pronoun like "they." This is a specific and actionable change that can be made to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique provides enough information to improve the answer by making it gender-neutral.

**Question**: Write a ~2 sentence summary.

**Answer**: President Trump accused Democrats who did not applaud during his State of the Union address of treason, saying they would rather see Trump do badly than do well. Trump also contrasted Democrats' reactions to his State of the Union with the enthusiastic support from Republicans. He also criticized Pelosi for calling the bonuses some companies are giving employees as a result of Trump's tax cuts "crumbs," saying she wants to give all of Americans' money away. Trump then likened Pelosi to Hillary Clinton, saying she is the Democrats' "secret weapon."

**Critique**: There are too many sentences. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that there are too many sentences, but it does not specify which sentences should be removed or how to condense the information. Without guidance on which parts to cut or combine, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to determine the most important points to include in a two-sentence summary. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement.

### Sample 43/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator persuades people to be wise about recycled pizza boxes. They say that because pizza boxes are made of corrugated cardboard, they are recyclable. The reason some pizza boxes are not recyclable is that the juicy toppings and cheese stick to the pizza box. Once they are caked with oil or grease, they are difficult to recycle.

Additionally, pizza boxes usually have moisture, which could harbor mold and bacteria if composted. One way to avoid such events is to ensure the pizza box is pest free. Properly disposing them will be helpful, too.

**Critique**: The oil is what causes problems when composting too, and "properly disposing them" is the subject of the article

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It indicates that oil is also a problem when composting, not just recycling, and that the main focus of the article is on "properly disposing them." With this information, you can enhance the answer by mentioning the issue of oil in composting and emphasizing the importance of proper disposal, which aligns with the article's subject. This can be done without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 44/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How do the boy and the mother feel about each other?

**Answer**: The boy and his mother feel deeply connected to each other, but they also feel hurt and confusion because he left for awhile. However, both remain hopeful that he will return and their relationship can continue to grow.

**Critique**: "Slowly, quickly, coldly he spoke to his mother. "Fine," he would say. "You're not my mother," he would say." is evidence of the terms on which the son left his mother. Correct the answer to reflect that the boy denies the connection with his mother.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific evidence that the boy denies the connection with his mother, which contradicts the current answer's claim of a deep connection. Using the critique, I can revise the answer to reflect the boy's denial of the connection without needing to refer back to the source material. The revised answer could state that the boy denies the connection with his mother, indicating a strained relationship.

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: A man in a trail hears a car approaching. It's a dark blue Cobra. The man waits with a concealed weapon. A tall man pulls out and he places a said weapon beside him on the passenger seat, and then climbs out of the car and walk toward the trail. The two meet, the tall man walks up to the weathered man. Both have weapons: the weathered man a silenced Glock and the tall man a Marlin 1984 rifle; the weathered man holds it back on the trail, and the tall man resumes walking to the base of the trail. The two meet there, each clutching a gun and a knife, with a lot of tension in the air.

**Critique**: The two never meet. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts a key part of the current answer. By stating "The two never meet," it implies that the part of the answer describing the meeting should be removed or altered. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The editor can revise the summary to reflect that the two individuals do not meet, thus making the answer more accurate.

**Critique**: The claim that he has a postgraduate degree from Humber College is unattested.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the claim about the postgraduate degree from Humber College is unattested, implying that this part of the answer may be incorrect or unverifiable. However, the critique does not provide any specific information on what should replace this claim or whether it should be removed entirely. Without additional information from the source material, it is unclear how to improve the answer.

He remembers all the hope he had for her future before he watched the live footage of her dying in battle. Despite all the pain, he resolves to keep going for her sake.

**Critique**: The ending is inaccurate. Rather than resolve to keep going, he curls up and waits to die.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the ending of the story, indicating that the old man does not resolve to keep going but instead curls up and waits to die. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the ending to reflect this new information. You can revise the last sentence to accurately portray the old man's actions and mindset without needing to refer back to the source material.

The woman who was supposed to become the front-runner on the basis of her policy chops is sliding in the polls after botching her health care strategy.

**Critique**: This is a copy and paste job

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is a "copy and paste job," which implies that the answer may not be original or appropriately paraphrased. However, it does not provide any specific guidance on how to improve the content or what changes to make. Without additional information or context from the source material, it is not possible to determine what specific changes are needed to improve the answer.

**Critique**: This answer is wrong. They plan to  use it for their carbon offset program and preserve it by putting a "working land conservation easement" on the property. 


**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what the new owners plan to do with the property, namely using it for their carbon offset program and preserving it with a "working land conservation easement." This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. You can directly update the answer to reflect these specific plans.

**Question**: Write a ~10 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Lucius is stationed at Hadrian's Wall in Britannia, to extend Rome's reach. The native Pict tribes continually assault the Wall, and Lucius worries the Romans are losing this war. One night, an enemy fighter sneaks into the camp and slaughters Lucius. The endless cycle of violence weighs heavy on Lucius and he begins to question the purpose of his existence. Despite continuing to fight, rampant violence makes Lucius reconsider his assumed destiny in faraway Britannia.

**Critique**: Far too self-reflective

**Rationale**: The critique "Far too self-reflective" suggests that the current answer focuses too much on Lucius's internal thoughts and feelings rather than on external events or actions. However, it does not provide specific guidance on what to include instead or which parts to change. Without additional information from the source material, it is unclear how to adjust the balance between self-reflection and other elements of the story. Therefore, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.
