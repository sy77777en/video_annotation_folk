## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating the QUALITY of a critique given a question and an answer.

A CONSTRUCTIVE critique provides actionable, specific feedback that helps improve the answer. It must identify a problem AND give enough information to fix it. This includes:

1. **Providing missing information**: "Some people are worried due to the virus" or "He was caught, though" (gives the actual content that should be added)
2. **Correcting errors with the right answer**: "It should be white, not black" or "The horse is brown, not white" or "There is no evidence it was a daughter, not a son" (points out what's wrong and what's right)
3. **Specifying omitted details**: "It's omitted that the child was being crushed under a roof"
4. **Identifying specific problems in the text**: "The last sentence is repetitive and not wholly relevant" (tells you exactly what part needs fixing)
5. **Giving concrete improvement suggestions**: "Combine sentences that convey the same idea" or "Use X instead of Y"

A NON-CONSTRUCTIVE critique only describes a problem without providing the information or guidance needed to fix it:
- "This doesn't answer the question" (doesn't say what the answer should be)
- "More details needed" (doesn't specify what details)
- "This is wrong" or "This is incomplete" (too vague, doesn't say what specifically)
- "The story never discusses X" (doesn't tell you what X is or should be)
- "There's an error here" (doesn't identify which part or what the error is)
- "This could be better" (no specifics on what or how)

Key distinction: 
- ✅ CONSTRUCTIVE: Points to a specific issue you can act on ("sentence X is repetitive", "missing Y", "should be Z not W")
- ❌ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE: Vague problem statement with no specifics ("something is wrong", "needs improvement")

Note: A critique that says "no evidence for X" or "not X" is constructive if it clearly indicates what the correct information is or should be (e.g., "no evidence it was a daughter, not a son" tells you it was a son).

Special case:
- If the answer is already correct and no critique is necessary, then an empty critique or one that says "no issues" should be treated as CONSTRUCTIVE/APPROPRIATE.

Please first provide your rationale (2-3 sentences explaining your reasoning), then output your classification.

Format your response as:
Rationale: [Your reasoning here]
Classification: [Constructive or Non-Constructive]

Question:
{question}

Answer:

**Critique**: should describe the content of the image

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the answer, which is the lack of a description of the content of the image. However, it does not provide any guidance or information on what the content of the image is or how to describe it.

#### Non-Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who is the narrator?

#### Non-Constructive Example 3

**Question**: How old was Sanuth when his cricket career took off?

**Answer**: It can be implied from the article that he was 19 years old.

**Critique**: Unnecessarily wordy answer

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a problem with the answer being "unnecessarily wordy," but it does not provide specific guidance on how to make it more concise or what parts of the answer should be revised.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 4

**Question**: What data can still be collected after this ban?

**Answer**: It is possible for data to be collected if the FBI claims there is a legitimate national security purposes.

**Critique**: This is incorrect. There are even further restrictions given, as the FBI were previously able to use "legitimate national security purpose" to justify any reason they had for collecting data.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a problem with the answer by stating that it is incorrect, but it does not provide specific information on what the correct answer should be. It mentions that there are further restrictions but does not specify what those restrictions are or how the answer should be adjusted to reflect them. Therefore, it lacks actionable guidance to improve the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How old was Jiranová when she first won a tournament?

**Answer**: Jiranová won her first tournament in 2014 when she was 17 years old.

**Critique**: This is false. She would have been 18 or 19.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific error in the answer by stating that the age given is incorrect. However, it does not provide the correct age or any additional information to fix the error.

### Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Where did Castor begin his career?

**Answer**: He began his career as a litigator in commercial law at the low firm Blank Rome in Philadelphia and Washington D.C.

**Critique**: The word "low" in this response needs to be changed to "law".

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific error in the answer, which is the incorrect use of the word "low" instead of "law." It provides the correct word that should be used, making it clear and actionable for improving the answer. This aligns with the criteria for a constructive critique as it points out the exact issue and how to fix it.

**Classification**: Constructive

Whose statues are they?

**Answer**: They are stone statues of military people.

**Critique**: Could mention that they died defending Earth,

#### Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Eve has come up with a crowd-developed Spectrum gaming monitor with HDMI 2.1. This means that you may now be able to have an Xbox Series X and a PS5 connected simultaneously.

The monitor is 27-inches in size and comes with 100W USB-C pass-through charging and integer-ratio upscaling. The Spectrum monitor with the HDMI 2.1 configurations comes at two prices; $529 and $629.

Delivering the solid gaming monitor is certainly a challenge for a small company like Eve. But everyone is cautiously optimistic about it.

**Critique**: The answer implies HDMI 2.1 allows connecting Xbox Series X and a PS5 simultaneously. That's wrong, it's the inclusion of two HDMI 2.1 ports that allows it.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific error in the answer regarding the functionality of HDMI 2.1. It clarifies that the ability to connect both an Xbox Series X and a PS5 simultaneously is due to the presence of two HDMI 2.1 ports, not just the HDMI 2.1 feature itself. This provides clear, actionable feedback to correct the misunderstanding in the original answer.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator is on trial, being walked by police officers in chains. He makes a crack about one of the officer's wives, whom he might have killed. The officer beats him. We flashback to the day of the murder. We learn the narrator himself is a police officer. 

**Critique**: The narrator isn't on trial. He's on his way to jail, as evidenced by Jason thinking, "It was disappointing to know that my last sight of the outside world would come from a spot-ridden plexi-glass window."

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific error in the answer, which is the incorrect statement that the narrator is on trial. It provides the correct information by clarifying that the narrator is actually on his way to jail, supported by a specific piece of evidence from the text. This gives clear guidance on how to correct the answer.

**Classification**: Constructive

---

#### Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why do they describe the bad cop as having a scandalous personality?

**Answer**: That information can't be found.

**Critique**: It is omitted that it seems so because they weren't sure if he was going to take them to prison or shoot them.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that was missing from the original answer. It identifies the reason why the bad cop is described as having a scandalous personality, which is due to the uncertainty about whether he would take them to prison or shoot them. This gives actionable feedback by specifying the content that should be included to improve the answer.

**Classification**: Constructive

## All Samples (Complete Sequence)

### Sample 1/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why was it transported to Boston?

**Answer**: It was probably to be re-sold.

**Critique**: The fact that the statue was installed in a Boston neighborhood is evidence against this answer.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the answer by pointing out that the statue was installed in a Boston neighborhood, which contradicts the idea that it was transported to be re-sold. However, the critique does not provide guidance on what the correct answer should be or how to improve the answer. It only highlights the problem without offering a solution or additional information.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 2/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything relating to Concord Management and Consulting, LLC.

**Answer**: Concord Management and Consulting, LLC. is a Russian firm being charged by Robert Mueller in connection with an alleged online influence operation. The firm has sought to intervene in an appeal brought by an associate of Roger Stone in order to challenge Mueller's appointment as special counsel. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. has denied the motion, but has allowed Concord to file an amicus brief should they choose to do so.

**Critique**: It's misleading to say that Mueller is charging Concord. It's the US Federal Court doing the charge, and Mueller is leading it. It's better to state what the charges are instead of who's doing it.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the answer, pointing out that it is misleading to say that Mueller is charging Concord, as it is actually the US Federal Court doing so with Mueller leading the investigation. The critique also provides a concrete suggestion for improvement by recommending that the answer should focus on stating what the charges are rather than who is doing the charging. This feedback is actionable and specific, making it a constructive critique.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 3/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The Eve Spectrum is a 27-inch gaming monitor that is set to be one of the first to support HDMI 2.1. The monitor is currently on pre-sale, with models coming in the last quarter of 2020. The first real-life photos of an early model have been released, and the company says that the first measurements will be published soon. Once the Spectrum is available, we'll be sure to share our thoughts on it.

**Critique**: Two higher-end models will come in the Q4 of 2020 while the entry-level model will come out in the first quarter of 2021.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that is missing from the original answer. It clarifies the release timeline by specifying that the higher-end models will be available in Q4 of 2020, while the entry-level model will be released in Q1 of 2021. This additional detail helps improve the completeness and accuracy of the summary.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 4/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why does the narrator suggest that they must terminate the patient's pregnancy?

**Answer**: That information is not covered in the text.

**Critique**: This is false. It is directly stated that, "...sorry, it's a boy. As you know our current sector has too many male children. When would you like to schedule the termination."

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific error in the answer by pointing out that the information is indeed present in the text. It provides the exact quote from the text that contradicts the answer, thereby offering clear evidence of the mistake. This allows the person who answered to understand what was missed and correct their response accordingly.

**Classification**: Constructive

**Answer**: The government told voters that only 80,000 married couples were paying more tax than couples living together. The true figure was almost half a million.

**Critique**: This response is not related.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response is not related, but it does not provide any specific guidance or information on how to correct the answer or what the correct answer should be. It fails to identify the specific issue with the answer or offer any actionable feedback to improve it. Therefore, it lacks the necessary detail to be considered constructive.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 7/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: What kind of security does Bank Zero offer to its clients?

### Sample 9/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~1 sentence summary.

**Answer**: A man-mountain leads a group of people to a lake where they are going to drown a child.

**Critique**: "A man-mountain leads a group of people to a lake where they are going to drown a child." - they were not going to drown the child. It appeared that way, but this looks more like a baptism.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific error in the answer by clarifying that the event described is not an attempt to drown the child but rather resembles a baptism. This provides the correct interpretation of the situation, which is actionable feedback that can be used to improve the answer. The critique specifies what is wrong and offers the correct context, making it constructive.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 10/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What kind of vehicle does Alan drive?

**Answer**: The compact Optra SRV could refer to a car, though not very sporty or interesting. It also could refer to a certain type of vehicle.

**Critique**: "could refer to a car, though not very sporty or interesting. It also could refer to a certain type of vehicle." - the unnecessary information ruined a perfectly good answer. This should be deleted. Replace "The" with "A" in "compact Optra SRV"

**Rationale**: The critique identifies specific parts of the answer that are problematic, such as the unnecessary information about the vehicle's sportiness and interest level, and provides clear instructions on how to improve the answer by deleting that information.

**Critique**: No content.

**Rationale**: The critique "No content" is non-constructive because it does not provide any specific feedback or guidance on how to improve the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 12/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is the narrator's gender?

**Answer**: The narrator is female.

**Critique**: IT seems the narrator was born female, but they had procedures to be more male presenting. This would mean they are now either male or gender neutral.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific feedback by indicating that the narrator's gender identity may have changed due to procedures, suggesting they might now be male or gender neutral. This directly addresses the answer's inaccuracy and offers a more accurate interpretation of the narrator's gender identity based on the context provided. The critique identifies the problem and provides the correct information needed to improve the answer.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 13/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~2 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) is a Singaporean agency that is responsible for coordinating Singapore's domestic and international policies and strategies in addressing climate change. The NCCS is part of the Strategy Group that supports the Prime Minister and his Cabinet, and it is also under the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC) which is chaired by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security. The NCCS has 4 main responsibilities: reducing carbon emissions throughout all sectors, assisting the nation in adapting to the short-term and long-term effects of climate change, seeking to tap on green growth opportunities brought about by climate change, and promoting climate consciousness and climate action among the general public.

**Critique**: "The NCCS is part of the Strategy Group that supports the Prime Minister and his Cabinet, and it is also under the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC) which is chaired by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security." can be omitted.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific part of the answer that can be omitted to make the summary more concise. By pointing out the exact sentence that is unnecessary, it provides actionable feedback that can be directly applied to improve the answer.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 14/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Why does the narrator suggest that they must terminate the patient's pregnancy?

**Critique**: "so as to" - use "to"

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific language issue in the answer, suggesting a more concise alternative. By pointing out the phrase "so as to" and recommending the use of "to" instead, it provides a clear and actionable suggestion for improving the clarity and conciseness of the sentence.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 15/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~7 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Leicester is going back into lockdown after a new spike in local coronavirus cases. This indicates that the current crisis is far from over. Nick Rushton, Leicestershire County Council leader, says that though the county rates are below the national and regional averages, the people of Leicester are asked to follow the SLR up to the extent possible. He adds that they were a bit sceptical to the move but now believe it a very sensible thing to do. The health secretary says that they are hoping that people in Leicester will stay at home as much as they can and against all travel to, from, and within Leicester. They have also been urged not to go to restaurants and pubs during the lockdown period. Sir Peter Soulsby, a city mayor, says the move is very disappointing. This is the plan that Boris Johnson will restart his premiership.

**Critique**: Why does the model shorten "strict lockdown rule" to SLR?
The summary is over seven sentences.

'He adds that they were a bit sceptical to...' 
This sentence has a wrong spelling of skeptical and inappropriate preposition use.

'He adds that they were a bit sceptical to the move but now believe it a very sensible thing to do.' 
Mayor Soulsby made this sentence, not Nick Rushton, as implied by the model.

'They have also been urged not to go to restaurants and pubs during the lockdown period.' 
This sentence was not stated in the article. Instead, the health secretary's declaration of another lockdown meant that pubs, restaurants, and salons planning to reopen would be delayed.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific feedback on several issues within the summary. It identifies a problem with the abbreviation "SLR" and questions its use, which implies that the full term should be used instead. It also points out a spelling error and incorrect preposition use, providing the correct spelling and suggesting a change in wording. Additionally, it corrects the attribution of a statement to the wrong person and clarifies a misrepresentation of the article's content regarding the closure of pubs and restaurants. These corrections and suggestions are actionable and specific, making the critique constructive.

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Eve has come up with a crowd-developed Spectrum gaming monitor with HDMI 2.1. This means that you may now be able to have an Xbox Series X and a PS5 connected simultaneously.

The monitor is 27-inches in size and comes with 100W USB-C pass-through charging and integer-ratio upscaling. The Spectrum monitor with the HDMI 2.1 configurations comes at two prices; $529 and $629.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the answer by pointing out that the focus on the fire and the farmers' market is insufficient and that the article actually targets potential customers for The Fritter Co.

Trump's casual stance on telling the truth was also apparent in remarks he made about retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.

**Critique**: "President Trump says it doesn't matter if he misled the media about his son's infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian nationals." - while OK on its own, this statement needs a reason why the lie didn't matter. Add something about the New York Times.

It also provides a concrete suggestion to include information about the New York Times, which is actionable and specific.
