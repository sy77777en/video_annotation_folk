## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating whether a critique is CONSTRUCTIVE or NON-CONSTRUCTIVE.

**Definition from first principles:**

A critique is CONSTRUCTIVE if and only if it provides ENOUGH INFORMATION to improve the answer WITHOUT needing to go back to the source material.

**The test (apply this literally):**
Imagine you are an editor who CANNOT see the original source text. You only have:
1. The question
2. The current answer  
3. The critique

Can you make a CONCRETE improvement to the answer using just these three things?

- If YES (you can write a better answer) → CONSTRUCTIVE
- If NO (you need to read the source to know what to write) → NON-CONSTRUCTIVE

**Important: Think creatively about implications**
Some critiques don't explicitly tell you what to do but strongly imply it:
- "Jerry does not leave" → Remove the part about Jerry leaving (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "We don't know the narrator's gender" → Use "they" instead of "he/she" (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "The sentence is unnecessary" but multiple sentences exist → Which sentence? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "Second sentence is irrelevant" → Remove the second sentence (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "First seven chapters are suitable for undergrad, book as a whole for grad students" → Implies chapters 8+ exceed novice (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "Statement cannot be confirmed and spelling is incorrect" → Fix spelling, remove unconfirmed statement (CONSTRUCTIVE)

**Critical distinctions:**
1. If answer is ALREADY GOOD and critique just confirms it ("accurate description", "correct answer"):
   → CONSTRUCTIVE (action = keep as is, no changes needed)

2. If critique says something is WRONG but doesn't tell you what's RIGHT:
   - "Everything beyond first sentence is inaccurate" → What IS accurate? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
   - "This cannot be confirmed" → What CAN be confirmed? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
   
3. If critique IMPLIES what's correct through contrast:
   - "First seven for undergrad, whole book for grad" → Clearly implies 8+ are advanced (CONSTRUCTIVE)
   - "Cannot be confirmed + spelling wrong" → Fix spelling + remove unconfirmed part (CONSTRUCTIVE)

**Examples to illustrate the principle:**

Example 1:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Could also mention the organizations she founded."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Which organizations? Need the source)

Example 2:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Should mention she founded UNESCO and WHO."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Specific organizations provided)

Example 3:
Question: "Why did she donate?"
Answer: "She was born in China."
Critique: "She was born in California, not China."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Doesn't help answer WHY she donated; need source for the reason)

Example 4:
Answer: "The narrator is a keen sergeant. He admires the Germans. He is confident he will survive."
Critique: "The second sentence is irrelevant."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove the second sentence)

Example 5:
Answer: "Jerry and Brian are happy, but when Janice dies, Brian cries and Jerry leaves."
Critique: "Jerry does not leave."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove or correct the part about Jerry leaving)

Example 6:
Answer: "The narrator lives in a small house. She wants to leave."
Critique: "We don't know the narrator's gender."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Change "she" to "they")

Example 7:
Answer: "Accurate, detailed description of the setting."
Critique: "The description is accurate."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Confirms answer is good; action = keep as is)

Example 8:
Question: "What chapters exceed novice level?"
Answer: "The first seven chapters."
Critique: "First seven are for undergrads, whole book for grad students."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Implies chapters 8+ exceed novice)

Example 9:
Answer: "Primoš is in urban area. Has trails and museum."
Critique: "Urban area statement cannot be confirmed. Spelling of Primož is wrong."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Fix spelling, remove unconfirmed statement)

Example 10:
Answer: "Complex narrative with several key points."
Critique: "Everything beyond first sentence is inaccurate."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (What IS accurate then? Need source to know what to write)

**Your task:**
Apply the test literally. Think about what the critique implies. Can you write a better answer using ONLY the question, current answer, and critique?

Format your response as:
Rationale: [Explain whether you can or cannot improve the answer without the source, and why. If you can improve it, briefly state how.]
Classification: [Constructive or Non-Constructive]

Question:
{question}

Answer:
{answer}

Critique:
{critique}

### Non-Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Non-Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who is Jerome Powell?

**Answer**: He is the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve.

**Critique**: Powell isn't the former Chairman.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the statement "He is the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve" is incorrect, but it does not provide the correct information about Jerome Powell's current or past position. Without additional information, such as whether he is the current Chairman or holds another position, I cannot improve the answer. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to determine the accurate information about Jerome Powell's role.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything relating to Kuku's personal life.

**Answer**: Kuku is married and has two children, He is the organizer of the rally in memory of the deportation of Crimean Tatars in 2014.

**Critique**: There is unnecessary information. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that there is unnecessary information in the answer, but it does not specify which part of the information is unnecessary. Without knowing which specific details are considered unnecessary, I cannot determine what to remove or change in the answer. Therefore, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand what is relevant to Kuku's personal life and what is not.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who is the narrator?

**Answer**: This information can't be found.

**Critique**: 
While the narrator is not named, identity can be defined by other factors such as their relation to the other character/s in a narrative, or the actions/roles they took in the story.



**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the narrator's identity can be defined by their relationship to other characters or their actions/roles in the story. However, it does not provide specific information about what those relationships or actions are. Without knowing these details, I cannot improve the answer to specify who the narrator is. The critique implies that there is more information available, but it does not provide enough detail to make a concrete improvement without referring back to the source material.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The author is asked what the best HDMI 2.1 monitor is. The author has no answer because there aren't any monitors on the market that support the higher refresh rates and other gaming features offered by HDMI 2.1. The author covers the Eve Spectrum, a crowd-developed monitor. The Spectrum is a 27-inch gaming monitor with 100W USB-C pass-through charging and integer-ratio upscaling. The hardware inside is fascinating too, with Eve using the same Nano IPS panel technology that we loved in our current 'best gaming monitor' pick, the LG GL850, with improvements to important metrics like brightness, contrast, refresh rate and local dimming. The monitor is also set to be G-Sync compatible, so VRR is an option on a range of platforms. The author is cautiously optimistic about the Spectrum.

**Critique**: The article is about answering the best HDMI 2.1 monitor question. The answer should be revised in that light.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer should focus on identifying the best HDMI 2.1 monitor, which the current answer does not do. However, the critique does not provide specific information on what the best HDMI 2.1 monitor is or how to revise the answer to address the question directly. Without additional details or suggestions on what constitutes the best HDMI 2.1 monitor, the editor cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material or conducting further research.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 5

**Question**: When does ordinary James Butler see extraordinary James Butler?

**Answer**: Every evening when he returns home from work.

**Critique**: The answer is incomplete

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is incomplete but does not provide any specific information or implications about what is missing or how to complete it. Without additional details or guidance on what constitutes a complete answer, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material. The critique does not offer enough information to make a concrete improvement.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is the significance of the story's title?

**Answer**: Finite is possibly describing the romantic encounter between these two characters--it is something brief that the narrator speculates will end once the night is over.

**Critique**: There's no need to say "possibly".

**Rationale**: The critique suggests removing the word "possibly" from the answer, which implies that the statement should be made more definitive. This is a specific and actionable change that can be made without needing to refer back to the source material. By removing "possibly," the answer becomes more assertive about the interpretation of the story's title.

**Classification**: Constructive

---

#### Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: James Butler leads a lonely life. He is an average man in an average home. He hardly forms connections and when he is not exactly working he watches ordinary things. Despite this simplicity,James Butler has a keen sense of what could have been.

**Critique**: James Butler has a wife and two kids. He lives an ordinary life, not a lonely life.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It states that James Butler has a wife and two kids, which directly contradicts the claim that he leads a lonely life. This allows for a concrete revision of the answer to reflect that he lives an ordinary life with his family, rather than a lonely one. The critique gives enough detail to make these changes without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Write a ~7 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Mike the fish is a fish who wants to be able to walk the earth like the greatest minds through history. He believes fish are not as smart as land-fauna. He has searched every corner of the Atlantic ocean for answers. He has talked to every kind of creature that exists in this otherwise marvelous place, only to be met with more questions. He believes he needs to find a way to get up there, with the land-fauna. He has a plan to reach the other realm. He believes he will be greater than Mozart, Julius Caesar, and Albert Einstein combined.

**Critique**: Remove final sentence and replace it with his death.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by instructing to remove the final sentence and replace it with information about Mike the fish's death. This allows for a concrete change to be made to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique implies that the narrative should conclude with Mike's death rather than his aspirations, which is a clear directive for revision.

**Classification**: Constructive

---

#### Constructive Example 4

**Question**: What is the narrator's gender?

**Answer**: The narrator is female.

**Critique**: The author may have been female, but they have undergone treatment to be more gender-neutral: 'The State supplied hormone pills took care of everything else.'

**Rationale**: The critique provides information that the narrator has undergone treatment to be more gender-neutral, which implies that the narrator's gender should not be definitively stated as female. Instead, the answer should reflect this gender-neutrality. Therefore, the critique allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the gender-specific language to gender-neutral language.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What has she achieved?

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the narrator's identity can be defined by their relationship to other characters or their actions/roles in the story. However, it does not provide specific information about what those relationships or actions are. Without knowing these details, I cannot improve the answer to specify who the narrator is.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the narrator's name is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but it suggests that there is enough information to identify who the narrator is. However, the critique does not provide any specific details or implications about the narrator's identity that would allow for an improvement to the answer.

**Critique**: I'd say "Sunderland AFC"

**Rationale**: The critique suggests a specific change to the name of the football club from "Sunderland Football Club" to "Sunderland AFC."

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who is the protagonist?

**Answer**: The protagonist is male.

**Critique**: There are same gender and no gender relationships.

**Rationale**: The critique mentions "same gender and no gender relationships," which implies that the information about the protagonist being male might be incorrect or incomplete. However, it does not provide specific information about the protagonist's gender or suggest an alternative.

**Critique**: Too much information is included.

**Rationale**: The critique "Too much information is included" does not specify which part of the information should be removed. Without knowing which specific details are considered excessive, it is impossible to make a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique does not provide enough guidance to determine what should be omitted, and thus, the source material would be needed to understand which information is unnecessary.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 15/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Who is Banksy?

**Answer**: Banksy is a British graffiti artist.

**Critique**: could be more detailed

**Rationale**: The critique "could be more detailed" does not provide specific information or guidance on what additional details should be included about Banksy. Without specific suggestions or implications about what details to add, such as notable works, themes, or impact, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material. Therefore, the critique does not meet the criteria for being constructive, as it does not provide enough information to enhance the answer independently.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 16/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why did the Leicester mayor find the move by the health secretary disappointing?

**Answer**: He did not want it to happen.

**Critique**: The model's answer appears incomplete because it does not explain why the Leicester Mayor was disappointed.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer is incomplete because it does not explain the reason behind the Leicester Mayor's disappointment. However, the critique does not provide any specific information or implications about what the actual reason might be. Without additional details or context, it is not possible to improve the answer to explain why the Leicester Mayor was disappointed. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material.

### Sample 17/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: In Amazon's upcoming Lord of the Rings series, Will Poulter will play one of the leading roles. The young actor managed to snatch one of the most coveted positions for young actors. The specifics of the role aren't disclosed.  The series is being developed by the writing team of JD Payne and Patrick McKay. The only information about its plot is that it will take place in the Second Age of Tolkien mythology and explore stories before The Fellowship of the Ring.

**Critique**: The mention that the role is coveted is not necessary to summarize.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the mention of the role being "coveted" is unnecessary for the summary. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by removing that specific part. Therefore, I can improve the answer by omitting the sentence or phrase that describes the role as "coveted" without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 18/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Where was Borash working previously?

**Answer**: WCW

**Critique**: "WCW" - Borash started his career at WCW before he moved to Impact Wrestling. Borash has been hired by WWE, so his last job was with Impact Wrestling.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about Borash's career progression, indicating that his last job before being hired by WWE was with Impact Wrestling, not WCW. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by updating it to reflect his most recent position before WWE.

The weathered man has won the final battle.

**Critique**: The story cuts off before the final showdown occurs. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the story ends before the final showdown, which implies that the current answer inaccurately describes events that do not occur in the source material. However, the critique does not provide any information about what actually happens in the story or how it should end. Without knowing the correct sequence of events or the actual conclusion, I cannot improve the answer to accurately reflect the source material. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source to know what to write.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 20/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Why did voters reject the proposal?

**Critique**: This response is not related.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response is not related, but it does not provide any information or implications about what the correct or related information should be. Without additional details or guidance on what the correct answer might involve, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the actual reasons why voters rejected the proposal.

However, the critique does not provide specific information on what the best HDMI 2.1 monitor is or how to revise the answer to address the question directly. Without additional details or suggestions on what constitutes the best HDMI 2.1 monitor, the editor cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material or conducting further research.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What was T. Uday Kumar's role in the movie Asuran?

**Answer**: T. Uday Kumar's sound mix for Asuran played an important role in the commercial success of the movie.

**Critique**: The answer is incomplete

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is incomplete but does not provide any specific information or guidance on what additional details are needed to complete the answer. Without further information about T. Uday Kumar's role, such as other contributions he may have made to the movie, it is not possible to improve the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

**Critique**: The answer should be more precise about the narrator's job.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should be more precise about the narrator's job, but it does not provide any specific information or details that would allow for a concrete improvement to the answer. Without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to specify the narrator's job more precisely. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 24/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: What is the narrator's gender?

**Answer**: The narrator is female.

**Critique**: The author may have been female, but they have undergone treatment to be more gender-neutral: 'The State supplied hormone pills took care of everything else.'

**Rationale**: The critique provides information that the narrator has undergone treatment to be more gender-neutral, which implies that the narrator's gender should not be definitively stated as female. Instead, the answer should reflect this gender-neutrality. Therefore, the critique allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the gender-specific language to gender-neutral language.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Does Avis Little Eagle have children? 

**Answer**: No, Avis Little Eagle does not have children.

**Critique**: How does the model know she does not have children? That information is not stated in the text.

**Rationale**: The critique questions the basis of the answer by pointing out that the information about Avis Little Eagle not having children is not stated in the text. However, it does not provide any alternative information or imply what the correct answer should be. Without access to the source material, there is no way to determine whether Avis Little Eagle has children or not. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer.

**Answer**: The 9th addition of the awards was held at the Accra International Conference Centre on October 12, 2019.

**Critique**: The answer should include the hosts of the event. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is missing information about the hosts of the event. However, it does not provide any specific details about who the hosts were. Without this information, I cannot improve the answer to include the hosts without referring back to the source material.

**Question**: Were most people afraid of spreading the virus?

**Answer**: No, most people were not afraid and wanted to take the risk.

**Critique**: It would be more accurate to say "it seems" most people were not afraid because this answer isn't said directly in the article. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests modifying the certainty of the statement by adding "it seems" to reflect that the information is not directly stated in the article. This provides a clear and actionable way to improve the answer by adjusting the language to indicate uncertainty. Therefore, the critique gives enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: Major information is missing.

**Rationale**: The critique states that "major information is missing," but it does not specify what information is missing or provide any details that would allow for an improvement of the answer. Without knowing what specific information is missing, it is impossible to enhance the summary without referring back to the source material.

**Critique**: There is no evidence in the story that the boy missed his mother while he was out exploring the world. Change the answer to reflect this imbalance of care.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the boy did not miss his mother while he was out exploring the world. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing or altering the part that suggests the boy claims to miss his mother. The critique implies that the relationship is imbalanced in terms of care, which can be reflected in the revised answer.

**Answer**: The protagonist is a cyborg who has developed a physical attraction for another cyborg.

**Critique**: This is just a theory. We don't know the protagonist is a cyborg. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that the information about the protagonist being a cyborg is just a theory and not confirmed. However, it does not provide any alternative information or imply what the correct identification of the protagonist might be.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How would Trump not have been in the middle of an impeachment inquiry?

**Answer**: The statement from Kelly implies White House advisers could have prevented it.

**Critique**: This is accurate, but a partial answer, because Kelly thinks his presence and employ could have prevented it. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides additional information that can be used to improve the answer. It specifies that Kelly believes his presence and employment could have prevented the impeachment inquiry. This allows for a more complete answer by incorporating this specific detail about Kelly's perspective. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it gives enough information to enhance the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

He founded the literary journal Rampike while he was a student at the Ontario College of Art.

**Critique**: Unncessary to mention Rampike.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that mentioning Rampike is unnecessary. This provides clear guidance to remove the part about Rampike from the answer. Therefore, I can improve the answer by omitting the information about Rampike, focusing solely on his academic qualifications and teaching experience.

**Question**: What is a crowd-developed monitor?

**Answer**: A monitor that is developed by a group of people who are interested in the product.

**Critique**: The potential users voted on the features and design choices. They didn't do the design.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the development process of the monitor, indicating that the potential users were involved in voting on features and design choices rather than actually designing the monitor. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by clarifying the role of the users in the development process. The improved answer could specify that the monitor is developed by a group of people who voted on the features and design choices, rather than directly designing it.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Have the patches been successful?

**Answer**: The patches have not been successful as Intel is experiencing issues with protecting its chips from the Spectre vulnerabilities. Specifically, there are three flaws in a recent firmware update and Intel has recommended that customers hold off installing the patch.

**Critique**: "protecting its chips from the Spectre vulnerabilities." - missing "Meltdown"

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer is missing the mention of "Meltdown" alongside "Spectre vulnerabilities." This implies that the answer should include both "Spectre" and "Meltdown" vulnerabilities to be complete. Therefore, I can improve the answer by adding "Meltdown" to the existing text about the vulnerabilities without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: Finite is possibly describing the romantic encounter between these two characters--it is something brief that the narrator speculates will end once the night is over.

**Critique**: There's no need to say "possibly".

**Rationale**: The critique suggests removing the word "possibly" from the answer, which implies that the statement should be made more definitive. This is a specific and actionable change that can be made without needing to refer back to the source material. By removing "possibly," the answer becomes more assertive about the interpretation of the story's title.

**Critique**: The phrase "to check against the such kind" is confusing.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the phrase "to check against the such kind" is confusing, which implies that the sentence needs to be rephrased for clarity. While the critique does not provide a specific alternative phrasing, it is clear that the sentence should be rewritten to eliminate the confusing phrase. A possible improvement could be: "This has been passed to prevent blatant invasions of privacy by the federal government." This rephrasing maintains the original intent while removing the confusing wording.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is missing information about the old man's feelings of guilt and pain upon learning of the woman's death.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything relating to Concord Management and Consulting, LLC.

**Answer**: Concord Management and Consulting, LLC. is a Russian firm being charged by Robert Mueller in connection with an alleged online influence operation. The firm has sought to intervene in an appeal brought by an associate of Roger Stone in order to challenge Mueller's appointment as special counsel. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. has denied the motion, but has allowed Concord to file an amicus brief should they choose to do so.

**Critique**: It's misleading to say that Mueller is charging Concord. It's the US Federal Court doing the charge, and Mueller is leading it. It's better to state what the charges are instead of who's doing it.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by clarifying the role of Robert Mueller and the US Federal Court in the charges against Concord Management and Consulting, LLC. It suggests focusing on the charges themselves rather than who is leading the charge. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by rephrasing the information to accurately reflect the legal process and focusing on the nature of the charges.
