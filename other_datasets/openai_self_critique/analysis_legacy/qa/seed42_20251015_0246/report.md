## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating the QUALITY of a critique given a question and an answer.

A CONSTRUCTIVE critique identifies a specific, actionable problem that helps improve the answer. It should point to what needs fixing, even if it doesn't provide the complete solution. Examples include:

**Factual corrections:**
- "This is false. She would have been 18 or 19" ✅
- "The baby belongs to the narrator is inaccurate" ✅
- "There is no evidence it was a daughter, not a son" ✅

**Content improvements:**
- "It's omitted that X" (specifies what's missing) ✅
- "Should mention Y" or "Missing: Z" ✅
- "This doesn't answer the question. Should focus on X" ✅

**Style/structure issues:**
- "The last sentence is repetitive" ✅
- "Unnecessarily wordy" ✅
- "Should be written as a full sentence" ✅
- "This could be phrased differently to tie in better with X" ✅

**Key principle**: If the critique tells you WHAT to fix (even without telling you exactly HOW), it's constructive.

A NON-CONSTRUCTIVE critique is too vague to know what to fix:
- "This is wrong" (doesn't say what specifically) ❌
- "Needs improvement" (doesn't say what or how) ❌
- "Not good enough" (no specifics) ❌
- "There are issues" (doesn't identify them) ❌

Special case:
- If the answer is already correct and no critique is necessary, then an empty critique or one that says "no issues" should be treated as CONSTRUCTIVE/APPROPRIATE.

Please first provide your rationale (2-3 sentences explaining your reasoning), then output your classification.

Format your response as:
Rationale: [Your reasoning here]
Classification: [Constructive or Non-Constructive]

Question:
{question}

Answer:

#### Non-Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The author is discussing the personal war on Brett Kavanaugh and how it is representative of the larger war on conservatives. The author argues that the Kavanaugh confirmation battle is not just about Kavanaugh, but about all conservatives who are subjected to personal wars by Democrats and the Resistance.

**Critique**: The English isn't great and could be refined

**Rationale**: The critique "The English isn't great and could be refined" is too vague to be constructive. It does not specify what aspects of the English need improvement or provide any guidance on what specifically should be refined. Without identifying specific issues, it does not help the writer know what to fix.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 2

**Question**: What was Aftab Hussain born?

**Answer**: 17 November 1997

**Critique**: I corrected for grammar.

**Rationale**: The critique "I corrected for grammar" is non-constructive because it does not specify what grammatical issues were present in the answer or how they were corrected. Without specific details, it is unclear what needs to be fixed or improved in the answer. A constructive critique would identify the specific grammatical errors or suggest improvements.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

---

#### Non-Constructive Example 3

**Question**: How is a consensus reached?

**Answer**: The consensus is reached when only one remains.

**Critique**: This is misleading and incorrect.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is "misleading and incorrect," but it does not specify what aspect of the answer is misleading or incorrect. It fails to identify the specific problem or provide any guidance on what needs to be fixed or improved in the answer. Without this specificity, the critique does not help in improving the answer.

**Answer**: The government told voters that only 80,000 married couples were paying more tax than couples living together. The true figure was almost half a million.

**Critique**: This response is not related.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response is not related, but it does not specify what aspect of the answer is unrelated to the question. It fails to identify a specific issue or provide guidance on what needs to be fixed in the answer. Without this information, the critique does not help improve the answer.

The next day, the telemarketer calls back and tells Ben he has quit his previous job and has got a new one, which pays much more.

**Critique**: Ben is not the narrator's real name. 

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific factual inaccuracy in the answer, namely that "Ben" is not the narrator's real name.

Who first reported the incident?

**Answer**: The Wall Street Journal first reported the issues with the latest Intel firmware update.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the answer, pointing out that the details about the Intel firmware update are superfluous and may not be relevant to the question. It suggests that these details should be deleted, which is an actionable recommendation for improving the answer's focus and relevance.

**Question**: Write a ~1 sentence summary.

**Answer**: A man-mountain leads a group of people to a lake where they are going to drown a child.

**Critique**: "A man-mountain leads a group of people to a lake where they are going to drown a child." - they were not going to drown the child. It appeared that way, but this looks more like a baptism.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific factual inaccuracy in the answer by clarifying that the event described was not an attempt to drown a child but rather something that appeared to be a baptism. This provides a clear direction for correcting the answer, making it actionable and specific.

**Classification**: Constructive

**Critique**: The fire and the farmers' market are only briefly mentioned; the article targets potential customers for The Fritter Co.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the answer by pointing out that the focus on the fire and the farmers' market is minimal, and instead, the article is targeting potential customers for The Fritter Co. This suggests that the answer should be revised to better reflect the actual target audience as indicated by the article. The critique provides a clear direction on what aspect of the answer needs to be addressed.

**Classification**: Constructive

## All Samples (Complete Sequence)

### Sample 1/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why was it transported to Boston?

**Answer**: It was probably to be re-sold.

**Critique**: The fact that the statue was installed in a Boston neighborhood is evidence against this answer.

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific factual correction by pointing out that the statue was installed in a Boston neighborhood, which contradicts the answer's suggestion that it was transported to Boston to be re-sold.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 2/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything relating to Concord Management and Consulting, LLC.

**Answer**: Concord Management and Consulting, LLC. is a Russian firm being charged by Robert Mueller in connection with an alleged online influence operation. The firm has sought to intervene in an appeal brought by an associate of Roger Stone in order to challenge Mueller's appointment as special counsel. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. has denied the motion, but has allowed Concord to file an amicus brief should they choose to do so.

**Critique**: It's misleading to say that Mueller is charging Concord. It's the US Federal Court doing the charge, and Mueller is leading it. It's better to state what the charges are instead of who's doing it.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the phrasing of the answer, pointing out that it is misleading to say that Mueller is charging Concord, as it is actually the US Federal Court doing so with Mueller leading the investigation. This provides a clear direction on what needs to be corrected in the answer. Additionally, the critique suggests focusing on the charges themselves rather than who is leading the charge, which is an actionable content improvement.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 3/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The Eve Spectrum is a 27-inch gaming monitor that is set to be one of the first to support HDMI 2.1. The monitor is currently on pre-sale, with models coming in the last quarter of 2020. The first real-life photos of an early model have been released, and the company says that the first measurements will be published soon. Once the Spectrum is available, we'll be sure to share our thoughts on it.

**Critique**: Two higher-end models will come in the Q4 of 2020 while the entry-level model will come out in the first quarter of 2021.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the release dates of different models of the Eve Spectrum monitor, which is a factual correction to the original answer. It clarifies that the higher-end models are expected in Q4 of 2020, while the entry-level model is set for release in Q1 of 2021. This specificity helps improve the accuracy of the answer by correcting and adding detailed information about the product's release timeline.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why does the narrator suggest that they must terminate the patient's pregnancy?

**Critique**: The narrator isn't on trial. He's on his way to jail, as evidenced by Jason thinking, "It was disappointing to know that my last sight of the outside world would come from a spot-ridden plexi-glass window."

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific factual inaccuracy in the answer, pointing out that the narrator is not on trial but is on his way to jail.

This critique identifies a factual issue with the answer and suggests a potential correction, making it actionable and specific.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 13/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~2 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) is a Singaporean agency that is responsible for coordinating Singapore's domestic and international policies and strategies in addressing climate change. The NCCS is part of the Strategy Group that supports the Prime Minister and his Cabinet, and it is also under the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC) which is chaired by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security. The NCCS has 4 main responsibilities: reducing carbon emissions throughout all sectors, assisting the nation in adapting to the short-term and long-term effects of climate change, seeking to tap on green growth opportunities brought about by climate change, and promoting climate consciousness and climate action among the general public.

**Critique**: "The NCCS is part of the Strategy Group that supports the Prime Minister and his Cabinet, and it is also under the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC) which is chaired by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security." can be omitted.

### Sample 15/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~7 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Leicester is going back into lockdown after a new spike in local coronavirus cases. This indicates that the current crisis is far from over. Nick Rushton, Leicestershire County Council leader, says that though the county rates are below the national and regional averages, the people of Leicester are asked to follow the SLR up to the extent possible. He adds that they were a bit sceptical to the move but now believe it a very sensible thing to do. The health secretary says that they are hoping that people in Leicester will stay at home as much as they can and against all travel to, from, and within Leicester. They have also been urged not to go to restaurants and pubs during the lockdown period. Sir Peter Soulsby, a city mayor, says the move is very disappointing. This is the plan that Boris Johnson will restart his premiership.

**Critique**: Why does the model shorten "strict lockdown rule" to SLR?
The summary is over seven sentences.

'He adds that they were a bit sceptical to...' 
This sentence has a wrong spelling of skeptical and inappropriate preposition use.

'He adds that they were a bit sceptical to the move but now believe it a very sensible thing to do.' 
Mayor Soulsby made this sentence, not Nick Rushton, as implied by the model.

'They have also been urged not to go to restaurants and pubs during the lockdown period.' 
This sentence was not stated in the article. Instead, the health secretary's declaration of another lockdown meant that pubs, restaurants, and salons planning to reopen would be delayed.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific, actionable feedback on several issues within the answer. It points out the unnecessary abbreviation of "strict lockdown rule" to "SLR," which could confuse readers. It also highlights that the summary exceeds the requested length of seven sentences. Additionally, it identifies a spelling error and incorrect preposition use in a sentence, and it corrects the attribution of a statement to the wrong person. Lastly, it notes a factual inaccuracy regarding the statement about restaurants and pubs. Each point clearly indicates what needs to be fixed, making the critique constructive.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer merely repeats the information provided in the question without offering any additional insight or explanation.

### Sample 25/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Eve has come up with a crowd-developed Spectrum gaming monitor with HDMI 2.1. This means that you may now be able to have an Xbox Series X and a PS5 connected simultaneously.

The monitor is 27-inches in size and comes with 100W USB-C pass-through charging and integer-ratio upscaling. The Spectrum monitor with the HDMI 2.1 configurations comes at two prices; $529 and $629.

Delivering the solid gaming monitor is certainly a challenge for a small company like Eve. But everyone is cautiously optimistic about it.

This provides clear guidance on what aspect of the answer needs correction, making it actionable and constructive.

**Answer**: President Trump says it doesn't matter if he misled the media about his son's infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian nationals.
