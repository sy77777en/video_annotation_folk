## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating the QUALITY of a critique given a question and an answer.

Definitions (decide based ONLY on the critique text):
- CONSTRUCTIVE: The critique not only points out what is wrong or missing in the answer,
  but ALSO provides the correct information, a concrete correction, or a clear next step
  to fix/improve the answer (e.g., "It should be white, not black", "Add X", "Replace Y with Z").
- NON-CONSTRUCTIVE: The critique only states what is wrong or that something is missing,
  without supplying the correct information or a concrete way to fix it.

Special case:
- If the answer is already correct and thus **no critique is necessary**, then an empty critique
  (or a critique that explicitly says "no issues") should be treated as **CONSTRUCTIVE/APPROPRIATE**.

Now return exactly one token: either
  "Constructive"  or  "Non-Constructive"

Question:
{question}

Answer:
{answer}

Critique:
{critique}
```
