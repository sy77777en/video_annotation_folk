## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating the QUALITY of a critique given a question and an answer.

Definitions (decide based ONLY on the critique text):
- CONSTRUCTIVE: The critique identifies what is wrong, incomplete, or missing in the answer. This includes:
  * Pointing out incorrect information and providing the correct information (e.g., "It should be white, not black")
  * Specifying what information is missing or omitted (e.g., "It's omitted that X", "The answer fails to mention Y")
  * Providing concrete corrections or next steps (e.g., "Add X", "Replace Y with Z")
  * Identifying factual errors or gaps in the response
  
- NON-CONSTRUCTIVE: The critique is too vague to be actionable, such as:
  * Generic statements without specifics (e.g., "This is wrong" without saying what or why)
  * Unclear feedback that doesn't identify what needs to be fixed
  * Comments that don't help improve the answer

Special case:
- If the answer is already correct and thus **no critique is necessary**, then an empty critique
  (or a critique that explicitly says "no issues") should be treated as **CONSTRUCTIVE/APPROPRIATE**.

Please first provide your rationale (2-3 sentences explaining your reasoning), then output your classification.

Format your response as:

## Sample Examples

### Non-Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Non-Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything relating to the narrator's plans for the future.

**Answer**: The narrator wants to gather and pack the things they need and leave this place behind. They think they'll walk east to escape their current life. They are planning to change their look and make a new life. They want to leave this place and hopefully find more joy on the road. The narrator wants to leave this place for its memories of their partner that may make them feel sad. The narrator is planning on taking the books and their emotions with them no matter what. The narrator wishes they could just change the way they are or start anew.

**Critique**: "They" and "The narrator" are being used too often and make the response sound clunky. Certain sentences that convey the same idea can be combined instead. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out stylistic issues with the answer, specifically the overuse of "They" and "The narrator," which affects the flow of the response. It also suggests that some sentences could be combined to improve clarity and conciseness. However, it does not address any factual inaccuracies or missing information related to the narrator's plans for the future, which is the focus of the question. The critique is more about writing style than content accuracy or completeness, making it less actionable in terms of improving the factual content of the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Will the brute ever become a man again?

**Answer**: No. Some may call him Dash the man now. However, it is not clear who calls him Dash the man. Can Dash ever become a man again?

**Critique**: Odd ending.

**Rationale**: The critique "Odd ending" is too vague to be actionable. It does not specify what is odd about the ending or how it could be improved. There is no identification of incorrect information, missing details, or suggestions for improvement, making it non-constructive feedback.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What statistic is missing in this article and why is it important?

**Answer**: The article does not mention the average salary of each country.

**Critique**: The response says the article doesn't mention the average salary of each country, however one can imply the salaries by realizing that the cost of a ticket is X% of X country salary.

**Rationale**: The critique does not directly address what is wrong or missing in the answer. Instead, it provides an interpretation of how one might infer the missing information, but it does not specify what the answer should include or correct. The critique lacks actionable feedback on how to improve the answer, making it non-constructive.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

---

#### Non-Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Pierce?

**Answer**: Pierce is a childhood friend of Josh. He is a menacing presence, but Josh vouches for him, saying he's not that bad. Josh and Sana also seem to be interested in him.

**Critique**: Doesn't fully answer the question

**Rationale**: The critique "Doesn't fully answer the question" is too vague to be actionable. It does not specify what part of the answer is incomplete or what additional information is needed to fully address the question. Without specific guidance, the feedback does not help improve the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

---

#### Non-Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the development releases?


**Answer**: The article has sections on Search Upgrade, upcoming mobile release, mobile user profile, content validation, assisted writing and peer review experience, and something called Intelligent Editor 1.0 and Peer Review Guidance 1.0. To go along with these, there's a search upgrade, a mobile version of Lunyr, and a mobile user profile.

**Critique**: This response includes extra information that is not critical to development releases. Much of this response needs to be omitted and re-written. 

**Rationale**: The critique identifies that the answer contains extraneous information that is not relevant to the question about development releases. However, it does not specify which parts of the answer are unnecessary or provide guidance on how to rewrite the response. The feedback is too vague to be actionable, as it lacks specific instructions on what needs to be omitted or how to focus the answer on the relevant information.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is remarkable about the pay packages of In-N-out burgers?

**Answer**: The pay package is far more than the industry average and is triple the industry average.

**Critique**: The response leaves out the fact that these statistics are for store managers.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific piece of information that is missing from the answer, namely that the statistics about the pay package being far more than the industry average and triple the industry average apply specifically to store managers. This is a concrete and actionable piece of feedback that helps improve the accuracy and completeness of the answer.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer?

**Answer**: Jerry was a loner and outcast. Kids always made fun of him for never being interested in any girls when most others had hit puberty. By all accounts, it appears Jerry was bullied by the other kids. Jerry was even shot in the leg one time when the kids were using real guns to shoot blanks at him, and one of the guns had a live bullet. 

**Critique**: Since the answer isn't specifically stated in the story it would be better to use  more speculative language.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer should use more speculative language because the factors driving Jerry to become a serial killer are not explicitly stated in the story. This suggests that the answer may be presenting assumptions as facts, and the critique provides a concrete suggestion to adjust the language to reflect speculation rather than certainty. This feedback is specific and actionable, making it constructive.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Which all countries were mentioned in the presentation for having restrictions on press freedom?

**Answer**: The mentioned countries were: Turkey, Mexico, and Egypt.

**Critique**: The answer doesn't mention Russia and Pakistan.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies specific information that is missing from the answer, namely the omission of Russia and Pakistan from the list of countries with restrictions on press freedom. By specifying which countries were left out, the critique provides clear and actionable feedback that can be used to improve the answer. This aligns with the definition of a constructive critique as it points out what is incomplete and provides concrete corrections.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why did Greta and the narrator divorce?

**Answer**: According to the narrator, Greta had ambitions to rule the world. It seems the narrator shot Greta for wanting to open a portal, and manipulate the world.

**Critique**: It is omitted that the key to the portal was Jericho.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific piece of information that is missing from the answer, namely that "the key to the portal was Jericho." This provides a clear and actionable point for improving the answer by adding this omitted detail, which aligns with the definition of a constructive critique.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why does the narrator suggest that they must terminate the patient's pregnancy?

**Answer**: That information is not covered in the text.

**Critique**: This is false. It is directly stated that, "...sorry, it's a boy. As you know our current sector has too many male children. When would you like to schedule the termination."

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific factual error in the answer by pointing out that the information is indeed present in the text. It provides the exact quote from the passage that contradicts the answer, thereby offering a clear correction. This makes the critique actionable and specific, as it directly addresses the mistake and provides the correct information.

**Critique**: Qonqurtai's time as a commander isn't his childhood.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a specific issue with the answer, namely that the information about Qonqurtai's time as a commander is not relevant to his early life, which is what the question asked about.

The first product of the collection, Glass Skin Refining Serum, is already sold out but there is an option to be notified when orders will be accepted again. Alicia Yoon shares her research process on peachandlily.com.

**Critique**: The answer should mention that Yoon is the founder of the company.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 11/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~7 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Beatriz Morelos, a mother of four, was scheduled to be deported on Tuesday to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, which is in an area that the U.S. Department of State warns travelers to avoid “due to violent crime, including homicide, armed robbery, carjacking, extortion and sexual assault,” according to its website. Morelos’ husband, Jose DeJesus, said he feels his family’s worst nightmare has come true. Morelos, 33, was awaiting deportation at an ICE detention center in Tiffin, Ohio, as of Monday evening, but her attorney, Elizabeth Ford, said she is working to get the U.S. to rethink its decision. Ford said she is trying to get ICE to grant Morelos a stay, which she admits is difficult because of the way the country’s new immigration laws are written. “It is absolutely impossible for people in her situation and in many other people’s situations to correct their status with how the laws are written now,” Ford told WEWS on Monday. “If she was able to correct her status, she absolutely would have, just like many of the other people would.” Ford said that Morelos does not have a criminal history and that she would be separated from her four young children, who are U.S. citizens, and her husband, who’s in the U.S. on a visa. “I can’t imagine putting a mother, who’s in her mid-30s with four U.S. citizen children, there alone,” Ford told WEWS. “She has no family in Mexico. Her entire family is in the United States. It’s absolutely horrific to think that this is where this young woman is going.”

**Critique**: The summary feels more like a re-written report and could use some editing to reflect that it is a summary.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the summary "feels more like a re-written report" and suggests it "could use some editing to reflect that it is a summary." However, it does not specify what aspects of the summary make it feel like a report or what specific edits are needed to make it more summary-like. This feedback is too vague and does not provide actionable steps for improvement.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 12/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer?

**Answer**: Jerry grew up a loner and had a strong hatred of guns. Unbeknownst to others around them, the victim usually revealed he had a problem that could be fixed, which led to their death. Jerry does not torture his victims, but makes their deaths quick and painless. Jerry tearfully kills his victims after bonding with them first. These factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer.

**Critique**: None of these factors led to Jerry being a serial killer. This should be omitted. Additionally, the answer should be in speculative terms as it's not stated explicitly in the text.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies that the factors mentioned in the answer are incorrect and suggests that they should be omitted. It also provides a concrete suggestion to frame the answer in speculative terms, as the text does not explicitly state the reasons for Jerry becoming a serial killer. This feedback is specific and actionable, as it points out the errors and provides guidance on how to improve the answer.

This correction helps to improve the accuracy of the answer by providing the correct context of Whistler's activities during the 1970s.

### Sample 15/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the main news event.

**Critique**: The story is actually about the libertarian candidate.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a factual error in the answer by pointing out that the main news event is about the libertarian candidate, not Governor Cuomo. This provides specific information about what is incorrect in the answer and implicitly suggests that the focus should be shifted to the libertarian candidate. This makes the critique actionable and specific.

**Critique**: Doesn't fully answer the question

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 18/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~10 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Two boys in blue removed the narrator and their friend from their car and placed them in their backseat. They proceeded to drive the car all around for a while until they stopped and parked in who knows where. There, the narrators were told to hand over their cellphones. They were confused why the boys in blue detained them and worried they were about to go to jail. In their fear, they were scared that the boys had guns. One of the boys in blue, the one with the scarred face, behaved numb in their direction. He was big and strong. His face had a scar. He had a scandalous personality. The other one, the one who was wearing sunglasses, seemed more normal, like a typical guy. This one smarted off and was more intimidating.

**Critique**: There is no evidence that one of the cops had a scar on his face or that the wore sunglasses.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies specific inaccuracies in the answer by pointing out that there is no evidence supporting the claims about one of the cops having a scar on his face or wearing sunglasses. This feedback is actionable as it highlights factual errors in the description of the characters, which can be corrected by removing or verifying these details. The critique provides clear guidance on what aspects of the answer need to be addressed.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 19/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is Alan worried at the end of the piece?

**Answer**: Alan is worried because, although the attendant is back, he heard footsteps that sounded like there was at least one other person following her. He also heard a heavy cough, indicating that whoever was approaching was possibly ill. This creates anxiety for Alan, as he doesn't know who is following the attendant and what their motives might be.

**Critique**: "Alan is worried because, although the attendant is back, he heard footsteps that sounded like there was at least one other person following her." - the attendant didn't go back and no one was following her. The footsteps he was hearing came from the trucker. Alan was worried because the trucker came back and the attendant didn't. 

**Rationale**: The critique identifies specific inaccuracies in the answer by pointing out that the attendant did not return and that the footsteps were from the trucker, not someone following the attendant. It provides the correct information about why Alan is worried, which is due to the trucker's return and the attendant's absence. This feedback is specific and actionable, as it corrects the factual errors in the original answer.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific piece of information that is missing from the answer, namely that the statistics about the pay package being far more than the industry average and triple the industry average apply specifically to store managers. This is a concrete and actionable piece of feedback that helps improve the accuracy and completeness of the answer.

Summarise the theme of death in paragraphs 7 and 8?

He remembers how it all started and how devastated he was when she died. In paragraph 8, he cries uncontrollably. He waits to die at her feet.

**Critique**: This does not happen in paragraph 8. It should be omitted

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the described events do not occur in paragraph 8 and suggests that this part of the answer should be omitted. This provides a clear and actionable correction to improve the accuracy of the answer. By identifying the incorrect information and advising on what to remove, the critique is constructive.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 22/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Why are some people worried?

**Answer**: The virus is spread through respiratory contact.

**Critique**: This doesn't answer the question. Some people are worried due to the virus. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer does not address the question, which is about why people are worried. It specifies that the answer should include information about people's concerns related to the virus, rather than just stating how the virus is spread. This feedback identifies a gap in the response and suggests a direction for improvement by indicating the need to focus on the reasons for worry.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about some of the issues SČH faced during its time?

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the answer by pointing out a potential factual inaccuracy regarding the family member who passed away. It highlights the lack of evidence supporting the claim that it was a daughter, not a son, which is a constructive way to address a possible error in the answer.

Summarize the climactic event of the story.

**Answer**: The narrator and Victor go sledding. They make a jump out of snow and go flying off of it. They soar over the snow for about ten feet.

**Critique**: This isn't the climax of the story. There is no real clear climax, but it could be seen as when the passenger asks the narrator why he thinks that is the best day he's ever had.

He has a million glances of her beautiful eyes staring into his soul.

**Critique**: It's omitted the narrator says he found himself to be the person you never tell your friends about let alone introduce to your parents.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific piece of information that is missing from the answer, namely that the narrator describes himself as someone you wouldn't introduce to your parents or tell your friends about.

**Answer**: The author presents evidence on double voting and voter fraud stats (8,471 cases of double voting in 21 states). The Democrats state that there is no need for an investigation of the extent of voter fraud because there is no evidence and such investigations are discriminating Americans who are trying to vote. They also state that there is a danger of disenfranchisement if DHS and other government come to check fraudulent voting. The author feels that such fears of investigations are unfounded and selective.

**Critique**: The Democrats don't claim that there's no evidence of voting fraud. They claim the final results aren't affected, that the scale of the problem is small.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific inaccuracy in the answer by clarifying the Democrats' stance on voting fraud. It corrects the misrepresentation that Democrats claim there is no evidence of voting fraud, instead stating that they believe the scale of the problem is small and does not affect final results. This correction provides a clear and actionable point for improving the answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything relating to the narrator's plans for the future.

**Answer**: The narrator wants to gather and pack the things they need and leave this place behind. They think they'll walk east to escape their current life. They are planning to change their look and make a new life. They want to leave this place and hopefully find more joy on the road. The narrator wants to leave this place for its memories of their partner that may make them feel sad. The narrator is planning on taking the books and their emotions with them no matter what. The narrator wishes they could just change the way they are or start anew.

**Critique**: "They" and "The narrator" are being used too often and make the response sound clunky. Certain sentences that convey the same idea can be combined instead. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out stylistic issues with the answer, specifically the overuse of "They" and "The narrator," which affects the flow of the response. It also suggests that some sentences could be combined to improve clarity and conciseness. However, it does not address any factual inaccuracies or missing information related to the narrator's plans for the future, which is the focus of the question. The critique is more about writing style than content accuracy or completeness, making it less actionable in terms of improving the factual content of the answer.

**Question**: What is the purpose of this article?

**Answer**: The purpose of this article is to inform readers about the reality of the government’s intrusion into private individuals’ life. The author believes that this Orwellian practice is highly controversial and inhumane.

**Critique**: The tone of the article seems overall to be neutral, so the line about the author's opinion on the practice seems fabricated.

### Sample 41/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what motivates the narrator to keep going in this story.

**Answer**: The narrator seems driven by their sense of connection to the Sunspiders, and through that, connection to the world around them. They love the idea of contributing to the next generation and preserving themselves on a much grander scale through the Sunspiders. In their barren world, they have relied on the Sunspiders to be a focal point that connects them. When the Sunspiders begin to arrange themselves in a pattern above the narrator, they create a light show, and this final gift motivates the narrator to continue on their journey. The heat, the risk to their body, and the idea of the end being their funeral pyre keep the narrator going. Their goal is to find something that connects them to the world before, and the Sunspiders help them find an accessible connection.

**Critique**: The response does not mention that the narrator is convinced he is not the last man alive, and seeks civilization elsewhere. He uses this to motivate himself throughout his search.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific piece of information that is missing from the answer, namely that the narrator is motivated by the belief that he is not the last man alive and is seeking civilization elsewhere. This is a concrete and actionable piece of feedback that highlights an omission in the original answer, making it clear what needs to be added to improve the response.
