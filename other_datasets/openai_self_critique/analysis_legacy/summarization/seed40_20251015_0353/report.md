## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating whether a critique is CONSTRUCTIVE or NON-CONSTRUCTIVE.

**Definition from first principles:**

A critique is CONSTRUCTIVE if and only if it provides ENOUGH INFORMATION to improve the answer WITHOUT needing to go back to the source material.

**The test (apply this literally):**
Imagine you are an editor who CANNOT see the original source text. You only have:
1. The question
2. The current answer  
3. The critique

Can you make a CONCRETE improvement to the answer using just these three things?

- If YES (you can write a better answer) → CONSTRUCTIVE
- If NO (you need to read the source to know what to write) → NON-CONSTRUCTIVE

**Important: Think creatively about implications**
Some critiques don't explicitly tell you what to do but strongly imply it:
- "Jerry does not leave" → Remove the part about Jerry leaving (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "We don't know the narrator's gender" → Use "they" instead of "he/she" (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "The sentence is unnecessary" but multiple sentences exist → Which sentence? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "Second sentence is irrelevant" → Remove the second sentence (CONSTRUCTIVE)

**Examples to illustrate the principle:**

Example 1:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Could also mention the organizations she founded."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Which organizations? What are their names? Need the source)

Example 2:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Should mention she founded UNESCO and WHO."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Now you can add those specific organizations)

Example 3:
Question: "Why did she donate?"
Answer: "She was born in China."
Critique: "She was born in California, not China."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Fixing this doesn't help answer WHY she donated; need source for the reason)

Example 4:
Answer: "The narrator is a keen sergeant. He admires the Germans. He is confident he will survive."
Critique: "The second sentence is irrelevant."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove the second sentence - you can do this without the source)

Example 5:
Answer: "Jerry and Brian are happy, but when Janice dies, Brian cries and Jerry leaves."
Critique: "Jerry does not leave."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove or correct the part about Jerry leaving)

Example 6:
Answer: "The narrator lives in a small house. She wants to leave."
Critique: "We don't know the narrator's gender."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Change "she" to "they" - you can fix this without the source)

Example 7:
Answer: "The answer is good."
Critique: "Correct answer."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Action: keep it as is - no changes needed)

Example 8:
Answer: "Brief description."
Critique: "Correct answer, needs more description."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (What description? Need source to know what to add)

**Your task:**
Apply the test literally. Think about what the critique implies. Can you write a better answer using ONLY the question, current answer, and critique?

Format your response as:
Rationale: [Explain whether you can or cannot improve the answer without the source, and why. If you can improve it, briefly state how.]
Classification: [Constructive or Non-Constructive]

Question:
{question}

Answer:
{answer}

Critique:
{critique}

## Sample Examples

### Non-Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Non-Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What parts of the book does the reviewer David Mumford call out as exceeding the abilities of a novice?

**Answer**: The first seven chapters.

**Critique**: The first seven chapters of the book are suitable for an undergraduate, but as a whole the book is best suited for graduate students. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides information that the first seven chapters are suitable for an undergraduate, which implies that the parts of the book exceeding the abilities of a novice are not the first seven chapters. However, it does not specify which parts of the book exceed the abilities of a novice. Without knowing which specific chapters or sections are challenging, I cannot concretely improve the answer. I would need to refer to the source material to identify the specific parts that are beyond a novice's abilities.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything related to Arthur Whistler's homes.

**Answer**: Arthur Whistler was born in San Bernardino County, California and earned a bachelor's degree in Biology from UC Riverside. He went on to serve in the Peace Corps and then move to Hawaii where he completed a doctorate in botany focusing on Samoan plant life. Whistler was an adjunct professor at the Department of Botany at the University of Hawaii and owned a consulting company. His death in April 2020 was the third fatality related to COVID-19 in Hawaii. At the time of his death, he had nearly completed another book called Flora of Samoa which focused on Samoa's native plants.

**Critique**: The article doesn't mention anything about Whistler's homes.

**Rationale**: The critique clearly states that the article does not mention anything about Arthur Whistler's homes. This implies that the current answer does not address the question at all. However, without additional information from the source material, there is no way to improve the answer to include details about Whistler's homes. The critique does not provide any specific information or direction on what to include regarding his homes, so the source material is necessary to make any concrete improvements.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Primož in the present day.

**Answer**: Primoš is located in a highly populated urban area. There are a number of tourist trails leading to the peak, and there is a Pivka Park of Military History.

**Critique**: "Primoš is located in a highly populated urban area." - this statement cannot be confirmed because it is not in the text. The spelling of Primož is also incorrect.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about Primož being located in a highly populated urban area cannot be confirmed and that the spelling of Primož is incorrect. While the critique identifies an error in spelling that can be corrected without needing the source, it does not provide enough information to correct or improve the statement about the location being in a highly populated urban area. Without additional information from the source, we cannot confirm or correct the location description. Therefore, the critique is only partially actionable.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize how the queen changes over the story.

**Answer**: At the beginning of the story, the queen has a fatal accident while helping the crew get everyone to safety. The king is upset that she was a distraction and almost died because of it. However, later the king and the crew are impressed by her bravery in rescuing their daughter. She underwent a complete character change over the course of the story.

**Critique**: All the key events mentioned in the response are wrong.

**Rationale**: The critique states that all the key events mentioned in the response are wrong, but it does not provide any specific information or corrections about what the correct events are. Without knowing what actually happens in the story, I cannot make any concrete improvements to the answer. I would need to refer back to the source material to understand the correct events and how the queen changes over the story.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about internet research?

**Answer**: The narrator was keen to learn about dentistry, so he decided to look it up on the internet. He watched a few videos, which were not for the faint of heart. The narrator was horrified by what he saw. He now goes to the dentist regularly. He decided to look up dentistry after learning that there was a void in the at-home orthodontist video market.

**Critique**: There is no answer to the question. The text does not focus on "internet search" as a subject matter. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the current answer does not address the question about what the story says regarding internet research. However, it does not provide any specific information or suggestions on how to correct or improve the answer to focus on internet research. Without additional details or guidance, I cannot improve the answer to address the question about internet research without referring back to the source material.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

Summarize resources for Australians to call up when their animals friends are in distress. 

**Answer**: The article recommends calling your local vet as well as your local wildlife group for help. It also recommends saving a few local wildlife rescue contacts in your phone so that you can ring for advice if you need it.

**Critique**: The second sentence is irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the second sentence is irrelevant, which provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer. You can remove the second sentence without needing to refer back to the source material. This action directly addresses the critique and improves the answer by making it more concise and focused on the relevant information.

#### Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize how the story ends.

**Answer**: The narrator has a loaded gun placed to their head by their former brother. He is killed with the former brother backing out of shooting him. The war had political implications and because of it, the narrator survived, leaving the battlefield. However, even at home, music and media isn't as kind as it would be to a law-abiding citizen. The conflict ended but the past lingers in the minds of those who fought in it.

**Critique**: Everything beyond the first sentence is inaccurate..

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that everything beyond the first sentence is inaccurate. This implies that the rest of the answer should be removed, leaving only the first sentence. The critique provides clear guidance on what part of the answer is incorrect, allowing for a concrete improvement without needing to refer back to the source material. By removing the inaccurate information, the answer can be improved to reflect only the accurate part as indicated by the critique.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the theme of moving on?

**Answer**: The narrator is moving out of her apartment and thinks about what she'll take and what she'll leave. She thinks about her relationship with her boyfriend and wonders if she's been a good partner. She wonders if she's been a good friend and if she's been a good daughter. She's moving on, but she's not sure what's next for her.

**Critique**: The first sentence is irrelevant to the theme of moving on. 

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the first sentence is irrelevant to the theme of moving on. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer: by removing the first sentence. The critique directly identifies which part of the answer does not contribute to addressing the theme, allowing for a concrete improvement without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Faccio's early career?

**Answer**: Mara Faccio started her early career as Assistant Professor of Finance at the UniversitŠ Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan in 1999. In 2001, she moved to the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame and the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University in 2003. In 2007, she became a full professor at Purdue University.

**Critique**: "UniversitŠ" should be "Università".

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific correction to a typographical error in the name of the university. You can improve the answer by correcting "UniversitŠ" to "Università" without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique gives enough information to make this specific change.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what the article has to say about voter fraud. 

**Answer**: The author submits and maintains that voter fraud is a possibility in many states for reasons that the author largely attributes to Democrat policies. Factors like allowing immigrants who don't yet have a legal status in this country to obtain driver's licenses contribute to voter fraud, according to the author. This is because one can vote online in a whopping 38 states. 

**Critique**: 38 states allow or will allow soon for registering to vote, not online voting.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that corrects a factual inaccuracy in the answer. It clarifies that the 38 states allow or will soon allow for registering to vote, not online voting. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the statement about online voting to reflect the accurate information about voter registration. Therefore, the answer can be improved without needing to refer back to the source material.

## All Samples (Complete Sequence)

### Sample 1/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the narrator have to say about single parenthood? 

**Answer**: The narrator's mother raised her alone. She admits that the hardest part of being a single mother is the lack of support but she proudly mentions her daughter's strength and tenacity that she got from seeing her mother excel in life despite not having a father as a support.

**Critique**: The response should be reworded for clarity on who is the mother.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the current answer lacks clarity regarding the identity of the mother. To improve the answer, I can rephrase it to make it clear who the mother is, without needing to refer back to the source material. For example, I can specify that "The narrator's mother raised the narrator alone," which clarifies the relationship and maintains the original meaning. This rewording can be done using the information provided in the question, answer, and critique alone.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 2/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about some of the issues SČH faced during its time?

**Answer**: The members began operating more or less on their own because they were initially untied to any trade union centre. The union bound themselves closer to the Czechoslovak Socialist Party as it faced police repression. As many miners were arrested and the union was increasingly dependent on the Czechoslovak Socialist Party.

**Critique**: It is omitted that its members struggled with economic hardship.

**Rationale**: The critique mentions that the members struggled with economic hardship, which is a specific piece of information that can be added to the current answer. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by including this detail about economic hardship without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 3/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything related to Samoa. 

**Answer**: Arthur Whistler was an ethnobotanist, academic and writer who focused on the flora of Samoa and Tonga. He had first lived in Samoa during the 1970s and trained Samoans on the country's flora and its uses. He authored more than a dozen books on the botany and ethnobotany of Samoa and the Pacific Islands. Whistler died in April 2020 at the age of 75 due to COVID-19. His death was Hawaii's third fatality related to the COVID-19 pandemic. His most famous work is the definitive guide to Samoa's native plants, "Flora of Samoa."

**Critique**: Whistler's death is irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the information about Whistler's death is irrelevant to the summary of everything related to Samoa. This implies that the sentence or part of the sentence mentioning his death should be removed. You can make this change without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides clear guidance on what is unnecessary.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 4/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Trump's issues with law enforcement?

**Answer**: Trump is at war with his own law enforcement officials. He has backup from his party. The day after Trump's State of the Union address was dominated by an extraordinary series of developments in which the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice challenged Trump both on the record and through what appeared to be anonymous leaks to CNN. The Republican attacks have been encouraged by increasingly conspiratorial Fox coverage centred on what hosts have called a "Deep State" attempting to topple Trump.

**Critique**: The answer omits that Trump's allegations are due to the FBI probe investigating his ties with Russia regarding the 2016 presidential elections.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the current answer to improve it. It mentions that Trump's issues with law enforcement are related to the FBI probe investigating his ties with Russia concerning the 2016 presidential elections. This detail can be incorporated into the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 5/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What other organizations can be inspired or learn from the Mechanics Educational Society of America?

**Answer**: The Mechanics did not affiliate with any major union for many years. Another independence was beneficial for the survival of the young union and its members. However, by the end of WWII, the Mechanics found a need to affiliate with a larger organization. It was necessary to be affiliated with an international union rather than national one. It was also wise to be a part of a larger labor movement.

**Critique**: The response seems to be critiquing the MESA and not answering the question.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the current answer does not address the question about which organizations can be inspired by or learn from the Mechanics Educational Society of America (MESA). However, it does not provide any specific information or suggestions on what the answer should include to address the question properly. Without additional details or examples of organizations that could be inspired by MESA, it is not possible to improve the answer using only the information given in the critique. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 6/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What occupation must the president's lawyer have in today's time?

**Answer**: It must be someone who is well versed in legal matters and can handle the president's case in court.

**Critique**: This isn't an occupation. It would just be better to point out that the question is confusing, as the president's lawyer is already a lawyer.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the question is confusing because it asks for an occupation when the answer already implies that the president's lawyer is a lawyer. However, the critique does not provide a clear way to improve the answer without referring back to the source material. It suggests that the question itself is problematic, but it does not offer a specific improvement to the answer that can be made without additional context or information from the source. Therefore, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 7/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the successes of the Chickasha baseball teams.

**Answer**: The Chickasha Chicks were successful in 1921 winning the Western Association. They were also successful the following year winning the Oklahoma State League. They qualified twice for the playoffs and won both times. Chickasha also was successful again in 1966 playing in the Southwestern League beating the Duncan Oilers.

**Critique**: The response inaccurately mentions Chickasha qualified twice for the playoffs, however they actually qualified multiple times, but only winning twice.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It clarifies that Chickasha qualified for the playoffs multiple times, but only won twice. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adjusting the statement about their playoff qualifications and victories without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 8/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Sabrina's relationship with the man that enters her hotel room?

**Answer**: Sabrina is a drug addict who uses the razor blade to cut her arm. The man that enters her hotel room is her drug dealer. He tells her that he woke up and found all his drugs and money gone. He asks her what she did with them. Sabrina does not know what he is talking about but she remembers the razor blade on her bed.

**Critique**: Remove the references to Sabrina's self-harming behavior and the razor blade used to accomplish this. It does not have bearing on the question.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific instructions to remove references to Sabrina's self-harming behavior and the razor blade, stating that these details are not relevant to the question about her relationship with the man. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by focusing solely on the relationship aspect without needing to refer back to the source material. The editor can remove the sentences or parts of sentences that mention self-harming and the razor blade, thus making the answer more relevant to the question.

**Classification**: Constructive

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How did the writer compose the structure of this informative article's narrative?

**Answer**: [rewrite]

**Critique**: "No answer" would be more appropriate

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the current answer is not present or is inadequate, and implies that the answer should be "No answer." This is a clear directive that can be followed without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete change to the answer by replacing it with "No answer."

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 10/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Kirkland's amateur career?

**Answer**: Kirkland played golf from the age of seven. She was semi-finalist in the Girls Amateur Championship in 2001. She was a member of the Arizona Wildcats women's golf team at the University of Arizona, winning the UNLV Invitational and was a member of the NGCA All American Team in 2005.

**Critique**: Add that she was All-PAC 10 Team and won the Golfstat award for par-five scoring leader in 2004 and 2005

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the current answer. It mentions that Kirkland was part of the All-PAC 10 Team and won the Golfstat award for par-five scoring leader in 2004 and 2005. This information can be incorporated into the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 11/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Gary's job?

**Answer**: Gary works in an office. He is stressed out by his job and daydreams about quitting it. He wants to be a bartender.

**Critique**: It is omitted that his job is well-paid. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests adding information about Gary's job being well-paid. However, it does not provide specific details or context that would allow for a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material. We know that his job is well-paid, but we don't know how to integrate this information into the existing answer effectively (e.g., where to place it, how it relates to his stress or daydreams). Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without needing to consult the source material.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 12/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What specific part of the performing arts did Fott gravitate towards?

**Answer**: When Fott was young, he was fascinated with The Muppets on Sesame Street and his. He has pursued theatre, puppeteering, and directing. He is also an actor.

**Critique**: The answer should state that Fott was drawn toward the performing arts.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should explicitly state that Fott was drawn toward the performing arts. However, the current answer already implies this by mentioning Fott's involvement in theatre, puppeteering, directing, and acting. The critique does not provide specific information on how to improve the answer beyond what is already stated. Therefore, without additional details from the source, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer based solely on the critique.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 13/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about making the documentary The Secret Policeman?

**Answer**: It was a documentary about an undercover reporter that reveals racism among police recruits in Manchester, England. 

**Critique**: The response should be much more specific and include more details. 

**Rationale**: The critique asks for more specificity and details but does not provide any specific information or guidance on what additional details should be included. Without access to the source material, it is impossible to know what specific details or aspects of the documentary should be added to improve the answer. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 14/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What parts of the book does the reviewer David Mumford call out as exceeding the abilities of a novice?

**Answer**: The first seven chapters.

**Critique**: The first seven chapters of the book are suitable for an undergraduate, but as a whole the book is best suited for graduate students. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides information that the first seven chapters are suitable for an undergraduate, which implies that the parts of the book exceeding the abilities of a novice are not the first seven chapters. However, it does not specify which parts of the book exceed the abilities of a novice. Without knowing which specific chapters or sections are challenging, I cannot concretely improve the answer. I would need to refer to the source material to identify the specific parts that are beyond a novice's abilities.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 15/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Primož in the present day.

**Answer**: Primoš is located in a highly populated urban area. There are a number of tourist trails leading to the peak, and there is a Pivka Park of Military History.

**Critique**: "Primoš is located in a highly populated urban area." - this statement cannot be confirmed because it is not in the text. The spelling of Primož is also incorrect.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about Primož being located in a highly populated urban area cannot be confirmed and that the spelling of Primož is incorrect. While the critique identifies an error in spelling that can be corrected without needing the source, it does not provide enough information to correct or improve the statement about the location being in a highly populated urban area. Without additional information from the source, we cannot confirm or correct the location description. Therefore, the critique is only partially actionable.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 16/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about Curzon's grandchildren?

**Answer**: He had four daughters, but no sons. His eldest daughter Anne Mildred Curzon married Major W. J. L. Willson, and had two sons and a daughter. His second daughter Gloria Mary Curzon married J. G. Bearman, and had two sons. His third daughter Juliana Eveline Curzon married firstly G. D. S. Smith, and had two daughters and a son. She was later married to Frederick Nettleford, Sir Dudley Cunliffe-Owen, and John Roberts. His youngest daughter Diana Geraldine Curzon married firstly Frederick Nettleford, and later married John Roberts.

**Critique**: The last sentence is inaccurate. It repeats the names of Juliana Curzon's spouses. The article also did not mention Diana Curzon's spouse or child. This error should be corrected.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the inaccuracy in the last sentence of the answer, indicating that it incorrectly repeats the names of Juliana Curzon's spouses instead of providing information about Diana Curzon's spouse or child. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the incorrect information and acknowledging the absence of details about Diana Curzon's spouse or child. The critique implies that the last sentence should be corrected to reflect accurate information or be removed if no accurate information is available.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 17/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize how the story ends.

**Answer**: The narrator has a loaded gun placed to their head by their former brother. He is killed with the former brother backing out of shooting him. The war had political implications and because of it, the narrator survived, leaving the battlefield. However, even at home, music and media isn't as kind as it would be to a law-abiding citizen. The conflict ended but the past lingers in the minds of those who fought in it.

**Critique**: Everything beyond the first sentence is inaccurate..

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that everything beyond the first sentence is inaccurate. This implies that the rest of the answer should be removed, leaving only the first sentence. The critique provides clear guidance on what part of the answer is incorrect, allowing for a concrete improvement without needing to refer back to the source material. By removing the inaccurate information, the answer can be improved to reflect only the accurate part as indicated by the critique.

### Sample 18/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize all the information relating to the mountainous Austrian Tyrol.

**Answer**: Averil Demuth's first story was set in the Austrian Tyrol. The girl Trudi, the boy Hansel, the cow Lotti, the dog Berni, the hen Griselda and the raven Kraak all go up the mountain to see Riese the giant, and then all come down again. Eleanor Farjeon gave the book a positive review. The House in the Mountains was also set in the Austrian Tyrol.

**Critique**: The sentence is unnecessary.

**Rationale**: The critique states that "The sentence is unnecessary," but it does not specify which sentence is unnecessary. Since there are multiple sentences in the answer, it is unclear which one should be removed. Without knowing which specific sentence the critique refers to, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the context and determine which sentence might be unnecessary.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 19/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about damage types?

**Answer**: There are three physical damage types: Impact, Puncture, and Slash. Physical damage come in ten elemental damage types: four base elements and the six combinations formed by modding two elements together. Elemental damage types are stronger or weaker versus certain enemy types. The physical damage types also have "status effects" that can be applied via a "procedural random chance" percentage, often known as procs. Impact procs make enemies suffer a dramatic stagger, Puncture procs reduce enemies' damage output by a flat 30%, and Slash procs inflict "bleed" damage over time. Slash is considered the most powerful procs from all of the physical damage types.

**Critique**: The response contains inaccurate information.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response contains inaccurate information but does not specify which parts are incorrect or provide any guidance on how to correct them. Without knowing which specific details are wrong or what the correct information should be, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer. I would need to refer back to the source material to identify and correct the inaccuracies.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer?

**Answer**: Jerry grew up a loner and had a strong hatred of guns. Unbeknownst to others around them, the victim usually revealed he had a problem that could be fixed, which led to their death. Jerry does not torture his victims, but makes their deaths quick and painless. Jerry tearfully kills his victims after bonding with them first. These factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer.

**Critique**: None of these factors led to Jerry being a serial killer. This should be omitted. Additionally, the answer should be in speculative terms as it's not stated explicitly in the text.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the factors listed in the answer did not lead Jerry to become a serial killer and should be omitted. It also advises that the answer should be framed in speculative terms. Based on this, I can improve the answer by removing the incorrect factors and rephrasing the answer to reflect speculation. For example, I could write: "It is speculated that Jerry's isolation and emotional experiences with his victims may have contributed to his actions as a serial killer." This change aligns with the critique's guidance without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about damage-scaling procs?

**Answer**: In an update coming soon, the developers will be making changes to IPS status effects and proc damage calculation. The primary goal is to improve Impact and Puncture. Both of these procs will now scale in effectiveness, based on the damage dealt. An Impact proc with a small damage output will still only cause a short stagger, while an Impact proc with high damage output can scale all the way up to a ragdoll. Puncture procs will now scale in effectiveness from 10% to 75% damage reduction, based on the damage dealt at the time of proc. Slash will continue working as it does now, stacking multiple status effects on top of one another.

**Critique**: The last line is not relevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the last line of the answer is not relevant. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by removing the last line about Slash. The critique does not require additional information from the source material to make this change, as it directly identifies which part of the answer is unnecessary.

According to the passage, she criticized Senate Republicans for getting through young, unqualified conservative judges too quickly. She also said the judges are likely to dismantle reproductive rights, marriage equality, and the separation of church and state.

**Critique**: The answer omits Lucius' criticism that two of the judges wouldn't state that they agreed with the Brown v. Board of Education 1954 Supreme Court decision that ruled racial segregation of public schools unconstitutional.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the current answer. It mentions that Kristine Lucius criticized two judges for not stating their agreement with the Brown v. Board of Education 1954 Supreme Court decision. This detail can be incorporated into the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

What does the text say about the woman the narrator loves?

**Answer**: The narrator refers to the woman he loves as mac. Mac is someone that almost seems like a mythological figure. She progressed in their relationship, which was followed by ups and downs. Inadvertently, the narrator realized that each day with her was the best day of his life. He enjoyed stockpiling a million glances of her beautiful eyes. Initially, he accepted that they would live happily aware. However, over time they had less microscopic moments. They drifted apart but the narrator wished that things went better in the end.

**Critique**: This is inaccurate

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is inaccurate but does not provide any specific details or corrections that would allow for an improvement without referring back to the source material. It does not specify which parts are inaccurate or suggest what the correct information might be. Therefore, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what the article has to say about voter fraud. 

**Answer**: The author submits and maintains that voter fraud is a possibility in many states for reasons that the author largely attributes to Democrat policies. Factors like allowing immigrants who don't yet have a legal status in this country to obtain driver's licenses contribute to voter fraud, according to the author. This is because one can vote online in a whopping 38 states. 

**Critique**: 38 states allow or will allow soon for registering to vote, not online voting.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that corrects a factual inaccuracy in the answer. It clarifies that the 38 states allow or will soon allow for registering to vote, not online voting. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the statement about online voting to reflect the accurate information about voter registration. Therefore, the answer can be improved without needing to refer back to the source material.

What there any personal vendetta involved in the investigation of the Trump campaign and its links with Russia?

**Answer**: The FBI agent and lawyer who exchanged private text messages during the campaign that were disparaging of Trump were on Mueller's special counsel team at one point before being reassigned.

**Critique**: It would be better to use speculative terms in this answer, since it's not concrete that there was a personal vendetta.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests using speculative terms because the current answer presents information that might imply a personal vendetta without concrete evidence. To improve the answer, you could modify the language to reflect uncertainty or speculation, such as using phrases like "it has been suggested" or "some believe." This change can be made without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides clear guidance on the tone adjustment needed.

**Critique**: It is not stated that Eric Karabils mentions that Pederson was able to reel in the passing game thanks to Wentz.


**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement "Eric Karabils mentions that Pederson was able to reel in the passing game thanks to Wentz" is incorrect. However, it does not provide any information on what should be stated instead or how Pederson's role should be described. Without additional details or suggestions on what to include, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand Pederson's actual role in the Eagle's comeback.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the difference in the competence of peer reviewers?


**Answer**: The text states that there is a "sweet spot" where the average peer review competency must be greater than a certain threshold to ensure high quality content. The text also states that the Peer Review System will more intelligently match peer reviewers in order to ensure that they collectively have a higher average peer review competency. Therefore, the text says that peer reviewers need to be more competent in order to create better quality content.

**Critique**: In this response, it is important to note that not all writers and peer reviewers are equally competent. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should acknowledge the variability in competence among writers and peer reviewers. However, it does not provide specific information on how to incorporate this point into the existing answer. Without additional details or guidance on what to add or change, I cannot concretely improve the answer. The critique implies a need for more information from the source material to address the variability in competence.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the narrator's thoughts on their King?

**Answer**: The village the narrator lives in doesn't have the best facilities, with their castle appearing to be in disrepair at best and there is no way to trade with the outside world. The narrator is an inquisitive type, always trying to learn more about their King and why they live so differently to the rest of the people of the kingdom. The narrator respects their King but is dissatisfied with how things are. When the narrator finally gets their chance, they ask simple questions, but the King speaks at length to the player, excusing his manner as slightly eccentric but his character and behaviors are as normal as any other human. That changes when the narrator goes adventuring with their King and come to realise the other side of things - this isn't "real", this is a game, and human lives are just tracks of existence which vanish when the person in the game is permanently killed or feels the need to leave. The narration is a first-person viewpoint shot from the person playing the game (their character), speaking from their perspective in the game.

**Critique**: Remove the first sentence because it contains false information.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the first sentence contains false information and should be removed. This is a clear directive that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

It mentions that the protagonist initially feels nothing but more placid and lethargic after using the vaporizer. The text also talks about how the protagonist wishes they could transcend their body and live amongst the stars. The text implies that the protagonist believes that vaporizers could be a helpful tool to make this happen.

**Critique**: The last two sentences are unnecessary. There is no evidence in the text that the narrator believes that the vaporizer will help him transcend their body.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the last two sentences are unnecessary because there is no evidence in the text to support the claim that the protagonist believes the vaporizer will help them transcend their body. This provides clear guidance on what to remove from the answer. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the last two sentences without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 39/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the possible messages hidden in the narrator's dreams about the girl?

**Answer**: The narrator's first dream where the girl spoke to him was probably meant to show him that she was already spoken for and happy with her life. The girl appeared to have a husband and two kids. They all looked so happy, with no troubles in the world. The narrator's second dream was probably meant to tell him "that's life" and he should move on with his.

**Critique**: This is confusing. It sounds as though he had dreamt that the girl had a husband. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer is confusing because it seems to suggest that the narrator dreamt the girl had a husband. However, it does not provide specific guidance on how to clarify or correct this confusion. Without additional information from the source material, it is unclear how to adjust the answer to accurately reflect the intended message of the dreams. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Answer**: Some related fields are sphere packing, which considers higher dimensions (here, everything is two dimensional) and is more focused on packing density than on combinatorial patterns of tangency.

**Critique**: This answer could also mention the theory of conformal maps and conformal geometry.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests adding information about the theory of conformal maps and conformal geometry as related fields to circle packing. However, it does not provide specific details or context about how these fields relate to circle packing. Without additional information from the source material, it is unclear how to accurately incorporate these fields into the answer. Therefore, I cannot improve the answer without consulting the source to understand the connection between these fields and circle packing.

At the time of his death, he had nearly completed another book called Flora of Samoa which focused on Samoa's native plants.

**Critique**: The article doesn't mention anything about Whistler's homes.

**Rationale**: The critique clearly states that the article does not mention anything about Arthur Whistler's homes. This implies that the current answer does not address the question at all. However, without additional information from the source material, there is no way to improve the answer to include details about Whistler's homes. The critique does not provide any specific information or direction on what to include regarding his homes, so the source material is necessary to make any concrete improvements.

**Answer**: The narrator has woken up after a sweet dream. He kisses his father, takes his camera with him on his way, and goes to school. When he comes back home, he finds a man on the door delivering packages. He decides to open one and finds memories of his childhood friend, a box, and a letter. He's shocked that she sent him her diary, but realizes the letter is for him to read first. She tells him about her journey battling cancer, the flashes of messages that he inspired, and how she loves him. The narrator realizes how fleeting life is, and how life might have been different if he were her or she were him.

**Critique**: The narrator's day before he gets the box is fake.

**Rationale**: The critique states that "The narrator's day before he gets the box is fake." This implies that the details about the narrator's activities before receiving the package (waking up, kissing his father, taking his camera, going to school) are not accurate or relevant to the summary. Therefore, you can improve the answer by removing or altering the description of the narrator's day before receiving the package, focusing instead on the key events related to the packages and their significance. This can be done without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides enough information to identify which part of the answer is incorrect or unnecessary.
