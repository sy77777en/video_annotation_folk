## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating the QUALITY of a critique given a question and an answer.

A CONSTRUCTIVE critique identifies a specific, actionable problem that helps improve the answer. It should point to what needs fixing, even if it doesn't provide the complete solution. Examples include:

**Factual corrections:**
- "This is false. She would have been 18 or 19" ✅
- "The baby belongs to the narrator is inaccurate" ✅
- "There is no evidence it was a daughter, not a son" ✅

**Content improvements:**
- "It's omitted that X" (specifies what's missing) ✅
- "Should mention Y" or "Missing: Z" ✅
- "This doesn't answer the question. Should focus on X" ✅

**Style/structure issues:**
- "The last sentence is repetitive" ✅
- "Unnecessarily wordy" ✅
- "Should be written as a full sentence" ✅
- "This could be phrased differently to tie in better with X" ✅

**Key principle**: If the critique tells you WHAT to fix (even without telling you exactly HOW), it's constructive.

A NON-CONSTRUCTIVE critique is too vague to know what to fix:
- "This is wrong" (doesn't say what specifically) ❌
- "Needs improvement" (doesn't say what or how) ❌
- "Not good enough" (no specifics) ❌
- "There are issues" (doesn't identify them) ❌

Special case:
- If the answer is already correct and no critique is necessary, then an empty critique or one that says "no issues" should be treated as CONSTRUCTIVE/APPROPRIATE.

Please first provide your rationale (2-3 sentences explaining your reasoning), then output your classification.

Format your response as:
Rationale: [Your reasoning here]
Classification: [Constructive or Non-Constructive]

Question:

#### Non-Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the skills needed to become a Russian pop star?

**Answer**: There are no clear indications of the required skills to be a good Russian pop star. However, talent in theater, cinema, TV and music seem to be shown in Napoli's case.

**Critique**: There's no specific answer, so it would be better to leave it at that.

**Rationale**: The critique provided is vague and does not specify what exactly needs to be fixed in the answer. It suggests that there is no specific answer, but it does not identify any particular issues or provide guidance on how to improve the response. Without specific feedback, it is unclear what aspect of the answer should be addressed or revised.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize how the queen changes over the story.

**Answer**: The queen is the wife of the king. She is on a ship with her baby when the ship is struck by lightning, and she and the baby are sent overboard. The dragon, who is one of the humans, saves the baby from the sea, taking it to its home on the island. The dragon takes the queen to save her life, but the king hates her for abandoning the baby. She is a mother who has lost her child, and the king of a country that hates her.

**Critique**: The information relayed in the summary lack coherence as the details are incorrect,

**Rationale**: The critique provided is non-constructive because it does not specify which details in the summary are incorrect or how the information lacks coherence. Without identifying specific issues or providing guidance on what needs to be fixed, the critique does not help improve the answer. It merely states that there are problems without elaborating on them.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Discuss LaFleur's play calls.

**Answer**: LaFleur made several questionable decisions. He had 4th & 2 from the Eagles 13-yard line, with his team leading 10-7. The Packers had been moving up and down the field. LaFleur took a page straight from the Sean McVay playbook and kicked the FG. That gave the Packers a whopping 13-7 lead. Where is the aggression? Why wouldn’t you trust Aaron Rodgers to make a play there? If you fail, you’re still up 10-7. LaFleur made some questionable play-calls.

**Critique**: A lot of the response is lifted from the passage.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that much of the response is directly taken from the passage, which implies a lack of originality or analysis in the answer. However, it does not specify which parts are lifted or suggest how to improve the answer by adding original content or analysis. Therefore, it lacks the specificity needed to be actionable.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What are the three possible approaches that music directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment?

**Answer**: a capella, instruments doubling the vocal lines, or a basso continuo

**Critique**: A little explanation of the approaches would have made the response much better.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer would benefit from additional explanation of the approaches mentioned. However, it does not specify what exactly needs to be explained or how the explanation should be improved. It lacks specificity about what is missing or unclear in the current answer. Therefore, it does not provide a clear, actionable problem to address.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about why Thompson wants to fight Lawler?

**Answer**: Thompson wants to fight Lawler because he believes it would show that he is still in the game and deserves another shot at the title. Thompson believes Lawler is one of the best strikers in the welterweight division.

**Critique**: This is not just a belief. 

**Rationale**: The critique "This is not just a belief" is too vague and does not specify what aspect of the answer needs to be corrected or improved. It fails to identify a specific issue with the answer or provide guidance on what should be fixed. Without additional context or detail, it is unclear what the critique is addressing or how the answer could be improved.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe the ways in which the woman fights off her assailant.

**Answer**: The woman first kicks the assailant in the groin and uses the remaining piece of a broken vase to stab the assailant's eye. She is then able to escape from the house and its occupants to save herself and her baby. The altercation on the ground makes the woman realize she has to fight her way out in order to save herself and her baby. She must be proactive and use any means necessary in order to escape her attackers. Although it seems like an uphill battle, she does not give up. She uses her strength and ingenuity to subdue the assailants. She uses whatever is at her disposal to create a way to get out of the situation alive.

**Critique**: The response implies that the baby belongs to the narrator, which is inaccurate.

**Rationale**: The critique specifically identifies a factual inaccuracy in the answer, pointing out that the implication that the baby belongs to the narrator is incorrect. This is a constructive critique because it highlights a specific issue that needs to be addressed to improve the accuracy of the answer. By identifying this error, the critique provides clear guidance on what aspect of the answer needs correction.

**Classification**: Constructive

Explain how the card turned from blank to displaying the numbers "76".

**Answer**: It probably wasn't him described in the story, but the events taking place could have been the back-story for who Pete met in the end.

**Critique**: This answer doesn't make sense. Additionally, it should say the answer can't be found.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the answer by stating that it doesn't make sense, which implies a need for clarity or coherence. Additionally, it suggests that the answer should acknowledge that the information cannot be found in the passage, providing a clear direction for improvement. This makes the critique actionable and specific.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is the civilian ship empty?

**Answer**: It turns out that Roger murdered Drake and then went mad killing everyone on board.

**Critique**: Although Roger killed Drake, it's not true that he went mad and killed everyone on board. The model's answer is inaccurate, insufficient, and should provide relevant and correct details from the story to answer the question.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific factual inaccuracy in the answer by pointing out that it is not true that Roger went mad and killed everyone on board. It also suggests that the answer should provide relevant and correct details from the story, which indicates what needs to be fixed.

#### Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the narrator?

**Answer**: The narrator can be described as a keen and careful sergeant in the army with a caring family, who sacrifices his wellbeing as well as that of his men for the greater good. He is valiant and resourceful, and he is committed to his men for the time being, commanding their lives in the shells of their rifles. He is conflicted by the fact that he unwillingly leads the men, who stand shoulder by shoulder to the slaughter with camaraderie, pride, fear, and anger. He also admires his foe, the Germans, for their bravery and tenacity. The narrator is also confident that he will not die with the Germans because he is a lucky man. His spirit dwindles as the Germans begin unleashing massive weaponry and his fellows are being killed left and right. In the end, he falls into the water, where he is saved by the British soldiers.

**Critique**: The listing of these emotions does not make sense given context

**Rationale**: The critique points out a specific issue with the answer, namely that the listing of emotions does not make sense given the context. This suggests that there is a problem with how the emotions are presented or integrated into the narrative, which is a specific and actionable point that can be addressed to improve the answer. However, the critique could be more constructive by specifying which emotions are problematic or why they don't make sense in context.

They were built in 1930 and secured underground with steel encased in concrete with ventilation pipes and steel plates to prevent damage from aerial bombardment. Primož's military tunnels were destroyed by German forces in 1944.

**Critique**: "totaling 5.2 kilometers" - it was never mentioned exactly how long the tunnels were in the text.

**Rationale**: The critique specifically points out a factual inaccuracy in the answer by stating that the exact length of the tunnels, "totaling 5.2 kilometers," was not mentioned in the text.

### Sample 9/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer?

**Answer**: Jerry grew up a loner and had a strong hatred of guns. Unbeknownst to others around them, the victim usually revealed he had a problem that could be fixed, which led to their death. Jerry does not torture his victims, but makes their deaths quick and painless. Jerry tearfully kills his victims after bonding with them first. These factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer.

**Critique**: None of these factors led to Jerry being a serial killer. This should be omitted. Additionally, the answer should be in speculative terms as it's not stated explicitly in the text.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies specific issues with the answer, pointing out that the factors mentioned do not actually lead to Jerry becoming a serial killer and suggesting that these should be omitted. It also provides guidance on how the answer should be framed, indicating that it should be in speculative terms since the text does not explicitly state the reasons.

### Sample 10/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the cost effectiveness of Aldi?

**Answer**: The secret to Aldi's success is that they offered a few hundred well chosen product lines at low prices and they followed a military style of organization. 

**Critique**: It is omitted that low prices are made possible by massive purchasing. This was combined with a high ratio of sales per square meter of floor space, and ferocious cost control — the latter being Theo’s special skill. Little money was wasted on marketing, and none at all on making Aldi stores look elegant: goods were simply piled up along the aisles in packing cases.


**Rationale**: The critique identifies specific information that is missing from the answer, which is crucial for understanding the cost-effectiveness of Aldi. It points out that the answer should include details about Aldi's purchasing strategy, sales efficiency, cost control, and minimal marketing expenses.

**Critique**: Additional detail about how De Villa's whole career is around public health issues should be stated. 

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the answer is missing additional detail about De Villa's career focus on public health issues. This is a content improvement critique because it identifies a specific area where the answer could be enhanced by including more information about De Villa's background and career, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of her opinion on public health.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 12/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Primož's strategic importance.

**Answer**: Primož is part of a ridge which separates the Pivka basin from the Reka valley. It possesses a commanding view over the entire Pivka basin, making it an important military location. During the Second World War, it was fortified with tunnels as part of the Alpine Wall, yet they were never used in combat. In total, the tunnels were more than two kilometers long, but they have since been abandoned. Today, it is made accessible by marked trails, with one specifically designated for tourists and containing numerous information signs around its peak. Primož's strategic importance stems from its commanding view and its military tunnels.

**Critique**: "which separates" - change to "that separates"

**Rationale**: The critique provided is specific and actionable, as it identifies a particular phrase in the answer that could be improved for grammatical accuracy or stylistic preference. By suggesting a change from "which separates" to "that separates," the critique points out a potential issue with the use of relative pronouns, which can help improve the clarity or correctness of the sentence.

The creature is multiple creatures and they are here as messengers. It says that Daniel's emissions are a beacon to something or someone dangerous.

**Critique**: Lacking movement only applies to the beginning, so this sentence can be rephrased to reflect that it's situational.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the answer, pointing out that the description of the creature as lacking movement is only applicable to a certain part of the story. It suggests that the sentence should be rephrased to reflect the situational nature of the creature's lack of movement. This provides a clear direction for improving the accuracy of the answer.

**Classification**: Constructive

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific piece of information that is missing from the answer, namely the context of the FBI probe investigating Trump's ties with Russia concerning the 2016 presidential elections.

Summarize the reveal at the end of the story.

**Answer**: Blocker is terminally ill, and the man with glasses tells him he only has a few months left. Blocker then realizes he has been fixated on the carpet, which is the color taupe. He cries.

**Critique**: This could be phrased differently to tie in better with the reveal. It should be said that Blocker only acknowledges this news and cries after he realizes what the color of the carpet is.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the phrasing of the answer, suggesting that it could be improved to better align with the reveal in the story. It provides a clear indication of what needs to be fixed by pointing out that the sequence of events should be clarified, specifically that Blocker acknowledges the news and cries after realizing the color of the carpet.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the narrator?

**Answer**: The narrator can be described as a keen and careful sergeant in the army with a caring family, who sacrifices his wellbeing as well as that of his men for the greater good. He is valiant and resourceful, and he is committed to his men for the time being, commanding their lives in the shells of their rifles. He is conflicted by the fact that he unwillingly leads the men, who stand shoulder by shoulder to the slaughter with camaraderie, pride, fear, and anger. He also admires his foe, the Germans, for their bravery and tenacity. The narrator is also confident that he will not die with the Germans because he is a lucky man. His spirit dwindles as the Germans begin unleashing massive weaponry and his fellows are being killed left and right. In the end, he falls into the water, where he is saved by the British soldiers.

**Critique**: The listing of these emotions does not make sense given context

**Rationale**: The critique points out a specific issue with the answer, namely that the listing of emotions does not make sense given the context. This suggests that there is a problem with how the emotions are presented or integrated into the narrative, which is a specific and actionable point that can be addressed to improve the answer. However, the critique could be more constructive by specifying which emotions are problematic or why they don't make sense in context.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about why Thompson wants to fight Lawler?

**Answer**: Thompson wants to fight Lawler because he believes it would show that he is still in the game and deserves another shot at the title. Thompson believes Lawler is one of the best strikers in the welterweight division.

**Critique**: This is not just a belief. 

**Rationale**: The critique "This is not just a belief" is too vague and does not specify what aspect of the answer needs to be corrected or improved. It fails to identify a specific issue with the answer or provide guidance on what should be fixed.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about mental illness?

**Answer**: The man seems to suffer from schizophrenia. He cannot stop staring at the floor, at the time where the story takes place, the carpet. He is found in an institution after a mental breakdown from not being in control of his own life. He isn't able to distinguish what is a hallucination and what isn't. He seems to get lost in it and feels a sense of panic.

**Critique**: The story does not say anything specific about mental illness and the answer's suggestion the main character suffers from schizophrenia is completely unfounded. At best, the main character appears to be a little obsessive in his attempts to identify the color of the carpet, but much of the answer is untrue.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the answer by pointing out that the story does not explicitly mention mental illness, and it challenges the claim that the main character suffers from schizophrenia. It also suggests that the character's behavior might be more accurately described as obsessive rather than indicative of schizophrenia. This provides a clear direction for improving the answer by focusing on what the story actually conveys about the character's mental state.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer would benefit from additional explanation of the approaches mentioned. However, it does not specify what exactly needs to be explained or how the explanation should be improved. It lacks specificity about what is missing or unclear in the current answer. Therefore, it does not provide a clear, actionable problem to address.

She has been on the fiction faculty of the New York State Summer Writers Institute, at Skidmore College, since 1997.

**Critique**: The text does not talk about education in general as a subject matter. The question does not specify if it is referring to Benedict's background education.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the answer, pointing out that the response does not address the question about education in general. Instead, it focuses on Elizabeth Benedict's personal background and career, which is not directly related to the broader topic of education. This critique is constructive because it highlights the mismatch between the question and the answer, suggesting that the answer should focus more on the general topic of education rather than personal details about Benedict.

**Critique**: The answer omits that one of the biggest surprises about the attack was that Gurdwara Sahib had a good relationship with the local community.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific piece of information that is missing from the answer, namely the good relationship between Gurdwara Sahib and the local community.

What does the text say about the weather and the number of deaths in Chicago?

**Answer**: In Chicago, a historic and deadly cold snap gripped a wide swath of the nation on Wednesday, fueled by the polar vortex, with temperatures plunging far below zero and wind chill numbers as extraordinary as they are dangerous. The temperature in Chicago tumbled to 21 below Wednesday morning, a record for the date, and closing in on the city's all-time record of minus-27 set in 1985. That record could fall on Thursday.

**Critique**: The highlighted text is a description of the extreme weather affecting a wide swath of the nation, not just "in Chicago", which makes this part of the response contradictory. It should be revised to reflect the fact that Chicago is affected. 

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the answer, pointing out that the description of the weather is not limited to Chicago, which contradicts the question's focus on Chicago specifically.

**Answer**: France's air accident investigation agency BEA will analyze black-box cockpit voice and data recorders from the crashed plane. France's announcement resolved uncertainty over the fate of the two recorders after Germany's BFU said it had declined a request to handle them because it could not process the new type of recorder used on the 737 MAX jets. Brazil, Mexico, and Panama are the first Latin American nations to suspend the Boeing 737 MAX. Panama's Copa Airlines had suspended operations of its six Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft until the findings are published of an investigation into the Sunday's crash.

**Critique**: The question's wording, "non-American countries", should be interpreted as "countries that aren't on a continent named America". Thus, Latin American countries shouldn't be mentioned.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the interpretation of the question's wording. It clarifies that "non-American countries" should exclude Latin American countries, which are part of the American continent. This provides a clear direction on what needs to be fixed in the answer by excluding references to Brazil, Mexico, and Panama.

**Answer**: LaFleur made several questionable decisions. He had 4th & 2 from the Eagles 13-yard line, with his team leading 10-7. The Packers had been moving up and down the field. LaFleur took a page straight from the Sean McVay playbook and kicked the FG. That gave the Packers a whopping 13-7 lead. Where is the aggression? Why wouldn’t you trust Aaron Rodgers to make a play there? If you fail, you’re still up 10-7. LaFleur made some questionable play-calls.

**Critique**: A lot of the response is lifted from the passage.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that much of the response is directly taken from the passage, which implies a lack of originality or analysis in the answer. However, it does not specify which parts are lifted or suggest how to improve the answer by adding original content or analysis. Therefore, it lacks the specificity needed to be actionable.

**Critique**: The first sentence of the answer should be rewritten because it says the students disagree with the movie and video game industry; meanwhile, the text does not indicate such. The model's answer changes the meaning from the text and is inaccurate and should consider correcting this.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the answer, pointing out that the first sentence inaccurately states that the students disagree with the movie and video game industry, which is not supported by the text.
