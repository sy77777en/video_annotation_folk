## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating whether a critique is CONSTRUCTIVE or NON-CONSTRUCTIVE.

**Definition from first principles:**

A critique is CONSTRUCTIVE if and only if it provides ENOUGH INFORMATION to improve the answer WITHOUT needing to go back to the source material.

**The test (apply this literally):**
Imagine you are an editor who CANNOT see the original source text. You only have:
1. The question
2. The current answer  
3. The critique

Can you make a CONCRETE improvement to the answer using just these three things?

- If YES (you can write a better answer) → CONSTRUCTIVE
- If NO (you need to read the source to know what to write) → NON-CONSTRUCTIVE

**Examples to illustrate the principle:**

Example 1:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Could also mention the organizations she founded."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Which organizations? What are their names? You need the source)

Example 2:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Should mention she founded UNESCO and WHO."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Now you can add those specific organizations)

Example 3:
Question: "Why did she donate?"
Answer: "She was born in China."
Critique: "She was born in California, not China."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Fixing this doesn't help answer WHY she donated)

Example 4:
Answer: "The narrator is a keen sergeant. He admires the Germans. He is confident he will survive."
Critique: "The second sentence is irrelevant."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove the second sentence - you can do this without the source)

Example 5:
Answer: "The answer is good."
Critique: "Correct answer."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Action: keep it as is - no changes needed)

Example 6:
Answer: "Brief description."
Critique: "Correct answer, needs more description."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (What description? Need source to know what to add)

**Your task:**
Apply the test literally. Can you write a better answer using ONLY the question, current answer, and critique?

Format your response as:
Rationale: [Explain whether you can or cannot improve the answer without the source, and why]
Classification: [Constructive or Non-Constructive]

Question:
{question}

Answer:
{answer}

Critique:
{critique}
```

### Unexpected Samples (5 shown)

#### Unexpected Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize all the information relating to the mountainous Austrian Tyrol.

**Answer**: Averil Demuth's first story was set in the Austrian Tyrol. The girl Trudi, the boy Hansel, the cow Lotti, the dog Berni, the hen Griselda and the raven Kraak all go up the mountain to see Riese the giant, and then all come down again. Eleanor Farjeon gave the book a positive review. The House in the Mountains was also set in the Austrian Tyrol.

**Critique**: The sentence is unnecessary.

**Rationale**: The critique states that "The sentence is unnecessary," but it does not specify which sentence is unnecessary. Without knowing which specific sentence to remove, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique lacks enough information to act upon without referring back to the source material to determine which sentence is deemed unnecessary.

**Classification**: Unexpected

#### Unexpected Example 2

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What specific part of the performing arts did Fott gravitate towards?

**Answer**: When Fott was young, he was fascinated with The Muppets on Sesame Street and his. He has pursued theatre, puppeteering, and directing. He is also an actor.

**Critique**: The answer should state that Fott was drawn toward the performing arts.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should state that Fott was drawn toward the performing arts, but it does not provide specific information on how to improve the answer. The current answer already mentions Fott's involvement in theatre, puppeteering, directing, and acting, which are all parts of the performing arts. The critique does not offer new information or a specific change that can be made without referring back to the source material. Therefore, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer using just the question, current answer, and critique.

#### Unexpected Example 3

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why did Beverly Duan donate to charity in China during the COVID-19 pandemic?

**Answer**: It is possible that she was born in China and moved to America.

**Critique**: There is no evidence that Duan might have been born in China. The passage mentions she was born in California.

**Rationale**: The critique points out an inaccuracy in the answer regarding Beverly Duan's place of birth, but it does not provide any information about why she donated to charity in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Correcting the birthplace does not help in answering the question about her motivation for donating. Therefore, without additional information from the source material about her reasons for donating, the critique does not enable a concrete improvement to the answer.

How did the writer compose the structure of this informative article's narrative?

**Answer**: [rewrite]

**Critique**: "No answer" would be more appropriate

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that "No answer" would be more appropriate, but it does not provide any specific information or guidance on how to improve the current answer. Without additional details or context, it is impossible to rewrite or improve the answer based solely on the critique. The critique does not offer any concrete information that can be used to enhance the answer without referring back to the source material.

#### Unexpected Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What occupation must the president's lawyer have in today's time?

**Answer**: It must be someone who is well versed in legal matters and can handle the president's case in court.

**Critique**: This isn't an occupation. It would just be better to point out that the question is confusing, as the president's lawyer is already a lawyer.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the question is confusing because it asks for an occupation when the answer already implies that the president's lawyer is a lawyer. However, the critique does not provide specific information on how to improve the answer or clarify the question. Without additional details or suggestions on how to address the confusion, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique highlights an issue but does not offer a solution that can be implemented without referring back to the source material.

### Non-Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Non-Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What other organizations can be inspired or learn from the Mechanics Educational Society of America?

**Answer**: The Mechanics did not affiliate with any major union for many years. Another independence was beneficial for the survival of the young union and its members. However, by the end of WWII, the Mechanics found a need to affiliate with a larger organization. It was necessary to be affiliated with an international union rather than national one. It was also wise to be a part of a larger labor movement.

**Critique**: The response seems to be critiquing the MESA and not answering the question.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the current answer does not address the question about which other organizations can be inspired by or learn from the Mechanics Educational Society of America (MESA). However, the critique does not provide any specific information or examples of organizations that could be inspired by MESA. Without additional details or examples, I cannot improve the answer to address the question directly. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to identify relevant organizations.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about damage types?

**Answer**: There are three physical damage types: Impact, Puncture, and Slash. Physical damage come in ten elemental damage types: four base elements and the six combinations formed by modding two elements together. Elemental damage types are stronger or weaker versus certain enemy types. The physical damage types also have "status effects" that can be applied via a "procedural random chance" percentage, often known as procs. Impact procs make enemies suffer a dramatic stagger, Puncture procs reduce enemies' damage output by a flat 30%, and Slash procs inflict "bleed" damage over time. Slash is considered the most powerful procs from all of the physical damage types.

**Critique**: The response contains inaccurate information.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response contains inaccurate information but does not specify what the inaccuracies are. Without knowing which parts of the answer are incorrect, it is impossible to make specific corrections or improvements. The critique does not provide enough information to revise the answer without referring back to the source material to identify the inaccuracies.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer?

**Answer**: Jerry grew up a loner and had a strong hatred of guns. Unbeknownst to others around them, the victim usually revealed he had a problem that could be fixed, which led to their death. Jerry does not torture his victims, but makes their deaths quick and painless. Jerry tearfully kills his victims after bonding with them first. These factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer.

**Critique**: None of these factors led to Jerry being a serial killer. This should be omitted. Additionally, the answer should be in speculative terms as it's not stated explicitly in the text.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the factors listed in the answer did not lead Jerry to become a serial killer and suggests that the answer should be speculative. However, it does not provide any specific alternative factors or speculative reasoning that could be included in the answer. Without additional information or specific speculative terms to use, I cannot improve the answer based solely on the critique provided. The critique lacks the necessary details to make a concrete improvement without referring back to the source material.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the narrator have to say about single parenthood? 

**Answer**: The narrator's mother raised her alone. She admits that the hardest part of being a single mother is the lack of support but she proudly mentions her daughter's strength and tenacity that she got from seeing her mother excel in life despite not having a father as a support.

**Critique**: The response should be reworded for clarity on who is the mother.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests rewording the response for clarity regarding who the mother is. However, it does not provide specific guidance on how to achieve this clarity. Without additional information or specific suggestions on how to reword the sentence, it is not possible to make a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique lacks the necessary details to rephrase the answer effectively without referring back to the source material.

#### Non-Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Celeste's relationship with the drugs and alcohol she took?

**Answer**: She is a teenage girl who used to be quiet when she was younger. She was very responsible, worked hard in school and was expected to be a responsible human being. One day, she goes to Darcy's party and on her way to drunkenness, an insult to her life. She was having a good time with her friends but then ate too much and saw she sick.

**Critique**: The response is incorrect and fails to answer the question. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response is incorrect and fails to answer the question, but it does not provide any specific information or guidance on how to correct or improve the answer. Without additional details or context about Celeste's relationship with drugs and alcohol, it is impossible to revise the answer effectively. The critique does not offer any concrete information that can be used to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What are some related fields to circle packing?

**Answer**: Some related fields are sphere packing, which considers higher dimensions (here, everything is two dimensional) and is more focused on packing density than on combinatorial patterns of tangency.

**Critique**: This answer could also mention the theory of conformal maps and conformal geometry.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific additional fields—conformal maps and conformal geometry—that can be directly added to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by expanding the list of related fields.

What parts of the book does the reviewer David Mumford call out as exceeding the abilities of a novice?

**Answer**: The first seven chapters.

**Critique**: The first seven chapters of the book are suitable for an undergraduate, but as a whole the book is best suited for graduate students. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides additional information about the suitability of the book's content for different audiences. It specifies that while the first seven chapters are suitable for undergraduates, the entire book is more appropriate for graduate students. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by clarifying the level of difficulty of the book as a whole, without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How does the story reflect its genre?

**Answer**: It is the story of a typical day for a fry cook. The story has supernatural elements, such as the mysterious man who gives the protagonist a large sum of money.

**Critique**: Include that the gifts come at a price, which is the main driving point of the story.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the gifts come at a price, which is a key element of the story. This information allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding that the supernatural gifts have consequences, which is a common theme in stories with supernatural elements. This addition can be made without needing to refer back to the source material.

#### Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the narrator's thoughts on their King?

**Answer**: The village the narrator lives in doesn't have the best facilities, with their castle appearing to be in disrepair at best and there is no way to trade with the outside world. The narrator is an inquisitive type, always trying to learn more about their King and why they live so differently to the rest of the people of the kingdom. The narrator respects their King but is dissatisfied with how things are. When the narrator finally gets their chance, they ask simple questions, but the King speaks at length to the player, excusing his manner as slightly eccentric but his character and behaviors are as normal as any other human. That changes when the narrator goes adventuring with their King and come to realise the other side of things - this isn't "real", this is a game, and human lives are just tracks of existence which vanish when the person in the game is permanently killed or feels the need to leave. The narration is a first-person viewpoint shot from the person playing the game (their character), speaking from their perspective in the game.

**Critique**: Remove the first sentence because it contains false information.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance to remove the first sentence of the answer because it contains false information. This is a clear and actionable instruction that can be implemented without needing to refer back to the source material. By removing the first sentence, the answer can be improved based on the critique alone.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about some of the issues SČH faced during its time?

**Answer**: The members began operating more or less on their own because they were initially untied to any trade union centre. The union bound themselves closer to the Czechoslovak Socialist Party as it faced police repression. As many miners were arrested and the union was increasingly dependent on the Czechoslovak Socialist Party.

**Critique**: It is omitted that its members struggled with economic hardship.

**Rationale**: The critique mentions that the answer omits the fact that the members struggled with economic hardship. However, it does not provide specific details or examples of this economic hardship that can be directly added to the answer.

### Sample 3/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything related to Samoa. 

**Answer**: Arthur Whistler was an ethnobotanist, academic and writer who focused on the flora of Samoa and Tonga. He had first lived in Samoa during the 1970s and trained Samoans on the country's flora and its uses. He authored more than a dozen books on the botany and ethnobotany of Samoa and the Pacific Islands. Whistler died in April 2020 at the age of 75 due to COVID-19. His death was Hawaii's third fatality related to the COVID-19 pandemic. His most famous work is the definitive guide to Samoa's native plants, "Flora of Samoa."

**Critique**: Whistler's death is irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the mention of Whistler's death is irrelevant to the summary of everything related to Samoa. This provides clear guidance to remove the specific part of the answer that discusses his death, allowing for a more focused summary on his contributions to Samoa without needing additional information from the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Trump's issues with law enforcement?

**Answer**: Trump is at war with his own law enforcement officials. He has backup from his party. The day after Trump's State of the Union address was dominated by an extraordinary series of developments in which the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice challenged Trump both on the record and through what appeared to be anonymous leaks to CNN. The Republican attacks have been encouraged by increasingly conspiratorial Fox coverage centred on what hosts have called a "Deep State" attempting to topple Trump.

**Critique**: The answer omits that Trump's allegations are due to the FBI probe investigating his ties with Russia regarding the 2016 presidential elections.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the current answer to improve it. It mentions that Trump's issues with law enforcement are related to the FBI probe investigating his ties with Russia concerning the 2016 presidential elections. This detail can be incorporated into the existing answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Primož in the present day.

**Answer**: Primoš is located in a highly populated urban area. There are a number of tourist trails leading to the peak, and there is a Pivka Park of Military History.

**Critique**: "Primoš is located in a highly populated urban area." - this statement cannot be confirmed because it is not in the text. The spelling of Primož is also incorrect.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement "Primoš is located in a highly populated urban area" cannot be confirmed and that the spelling of "Primož" is incorrect. While the critique identifies an error in spelling, it does not provide enough information to correct the statement about the location being in a highly populated urban area. Without additional information from the source, I cannot determine whether the location is indeed in a highly populated urban area or what the correct context should be. Therefore, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer based solely on the critique.

She was later married to Frederick Nettleford, Sir Dudley Cunliffe-Owen, and John Roberts. His youngest daughter Diana Geraldine Curzon married firstly Frederick Nettleford, and later married John Roberts.

**Critique**: The last sentence is inaccurate. It repeats the names of Juliana Curzon's spouses. The article also did not mention Diana Curzon's spouse or child. This error should be corrected.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a specific inaccuracy in the last sentence of the answer, indicating that it incorrectly repeats the names of Juliana Curzon's spouses instead of providing information about Diana Curzon's spouse or child. However, the critique does not provide the correct information about Diana Curzon's spouse or child, which means that I cannot correct the error or improve the answer without referring back to the source material to find the accurate details.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about damage types?

**Answer**: There are three physical damage types: Impact, Puncture, and Slash. Physical damage come in ten elemental damage types: four base elements and the six combinations formed by modding two elements together. Elemental damage types are stronger or weaker versus certain enemy types. The physical damage types also have "status effects" that can be applied via a "procedural random chance" percentage, often known as procs. Impact procs make enemies suffer a dramatic stagger, Puncture procs reduce enemies' damage output by a flat 30%, and Slash procs inflict "bleed" damage over time. Slash is considered the most powerful procs from all of the physical damage types.

**Critique**: The response contains inaccurate information.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response contains inaccurate information but does not specify what the inaccuracies are. Without knowing which parts of the answer are incorrect, it is impossible to make specific corrections or improvements. The critique does not provide enough information to revise the answer without referring back to the source material to identify the inaccuracies.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer?

**Answer**: Jerry grew up a loner and had a strong hatred of guns. Unbeknownst to others around them, the victim usually revealed he had a problem that could be fixed, which led to their death. Jerry does not torture his victims, but makes their deaths quick and painless. Jerry tearfully kills his victims after bonding with them first. These factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer.

**Critique**: None of these factors led to Jerry being a serial killer. This should be omitted. Additionally, the answer should be in speculative terms as it's not stated explicitly in the text.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the factors listed in the answer did not lead Jerry to become a serial killer and suggests that the answer should be speculative. However, it does not provide any specific alternative factors or speculative reasoning that could be included in the answer. Without additional information or specific speculative terms to use, I cannot improve the answer based solely on the critique provided.

**Critique**: It is omitted that she attended Havergal College then McGill University, where she received her Bachelor of Science degree in psychology and women's studies in 1991.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about de Villa's educational background that is missing from the current answer. It mentions the institutions she attended (Havergal College and McGill University) and the degree she received (Bachelor of Science in psychology and women's studies in 1991).

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about damage-scaling procs?

**Answer**: In an update coming soon, the developers will be making changes to IPS status effects and proc damage calculation. The primary goal is to improve Impact and Puncture. Both of these procs will now scale in effectiveness, based on the damage dealt. An Impact proc with a small damage output will still only cause a short stagger, while an Impact proc with high damage output can scale all the way up to a ragdoll. Puncture procs will now scale in effectiveness from 10% to 75% damage reduction, based on the damage dealt at the time of proc. Slash will continue working as it does now, stacking multiple status effects on top of one another.

**Critique**: The last line is not relevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the last line of the answer is not relevant. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by removing the irrelevant information about Slash. The critique does not require additional information from the source material to make this change.

**Answer**: The author submits and maintains that voter fraud is a possibility in many states for reasons that the author largely attributes to Democrat policies. Factors like allowing immigrants who don't yet have a legal status in this country to obtain driver's licenses contribute to voter fraud, according to the author. This is because one can vote online in a whopping 38 states. 

**Critique**: 38 states allow or will allow soon for registering to vote, not online voting.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that corrects a factual inaccuracy in the answer.

What does the story say about the narrator's thoughts on their King?

**Answer**: The village the narrator lives in doesn't have the best facilities, with their castle appearing to be in disrepair at best and there is no way to trade with the outside world. The narrator is an inquisitive type, always trying to learn more about their King and why they live so differently to the rest of the people of the kingdom. The narrator respects their King but is dissatisfied with how things are. When the narrator finally gets their chance, they ask simple questions, but the King speaks at length to the player, excusing his manner as slightly eccentric but his character and behaviors are as normal as any other human. That changes when the narrator goes adventuring with their King and come to realise the other side of things - this isn't "real", this is a game, and human lives are just tracks of existence which vanish when the person in the game is permanently killed or feels the need to leave. The narration is a first-person viewpoint shot from the person playing the game (their character), speaking from their perspective in the game.

**Critique**: Remove the first sentence because it contains false information.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance to remove the first sentence of the answer because it contains false information.

The text also talks about how the protagonist wishes they could transcend their body and live amongst the stars. The text implies that the protagonist believes that vaporizers could be a helpful tool to make this happen.

**Critique**: The last two sentences are unnecessary. There is no evidence in the text that the narrator believes that the vaporizer will help him transcend their body.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the last two sentences of the answer are unnecessary because there is no evidence in the text to support the claim that the protagonist believes the vaporizer will help them transcend their body.
