## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating whether a critique is CONSTRUCTIVE or NON-CONSTRUCTIVE.

**Definition from first principles:**

A critique is CONSTRUCTIVE if and only if it provides ENOUGH INFORMATION to improve the answer WITHOUT needing to go back to the source material.

**The test (apply this literally):**
Imagine you are an editor who CANNOT see the original source text. You only have:
1. The question
2. The current answer  
3. The critique

Can you make a CONCRETE improvement to the answer using just these three things?

- If YES (you can write a better answer) → CONSTRUCTIVE
- If NO (you need to read the source to know what to write) → NON-CONSTRUCTIVE

**Important: Think creatively about implications**
Some critiques don't explicitly tell you what to do but strongly imply it:
- "Jerry does not leave" → Remove the part about Jerry leaving (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "We don't know the narrator's gender" → Use "they" instead of "he/she" (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "The sentence is unnecessary" but multiple sentences exist → Which sentence? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "Second sentence is irrelevant" → Remove the second sentence (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "First seven chapters are suitable for undergrad, book as a whole for grad students" → Implies chapters 8+ exceed novice (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "Statement cannot be confirmed and spelling is incorrect" → Fix spelling, remove unconfirmed statement (CONSTRUCTIVE)

**Critical distinctions:**
1. If answer is ALREADY GOOD and critique just confirms it ("accurate description", "correct answer"):
   → CONSTRUCTIVE (action = keep as is, no changes needed)

2. If critique says something is WRONG but doesn't tell you what's RIGHT:
   - "Everything beyond first sentence is inaccurate" → What IS accurate? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
   - "This cannot be confirmed" → What CAN be confirmed? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
   
3. If critique IMPLIES what's correct through contrast:
   - "First seven for undergrad, whole book for grad" → Clearly implies 8+ are advanced (CONSTRUCTIVE)
   - "Cannot be confirmed + spelling wrong" → Fix spelling + remove unconfirmed part (CONSTRUCTIVE)

**Examples to illustrate the principle:**

Example 1:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Could also mention the organizations she founded."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Which organizations? Need the source)

Example 2:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Should mention she founded UNESCO and WHO."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Specific organizations provided)

Example 3:
Question: "Why did she donate?"
Answer: "She was born in China."
Critique: "She was born in California, not China."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Doesn't help answer WHY she donated; need source for the reason)

Example 4:
Answer: "The narrator is a keen sergeant. He admires the Germans. He is confident he will survive."
Critique: "The second sentence is irrelevant."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove the second sentence)

Example 5:
Answer: "Jerry and Brian are happy, but when Janice dies, Brian cries and Jerry leaves."
Critique: "Jerry does not leave."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove or correct the part about Jerry leaving)

Example 6:
Answer: "The narrator lives in a small house. She wants to leave."
Critique: "We don't know the narrator's gender."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Change "she" to "they")

Example 7:
Answer: "Accurate, detailed description of the setting."
Critique: "The description is accurate."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Confirms answer is good; action = keep as is)

Example 8:
Question: "What chapters exceed novice level?"
Answer: "The first seven chapters."
Critique: "First seven are for undergrads, whole book for grad students."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Implies chapters 8+ exceed novice)

Example 9:
Answer: "Primoš is in urban area. Has trails and museum."
Critique: "Urban area statement cannot be confirmed. Spelling of Primož is wrong."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Fix spelling, remove unconfirmed statement)

Example 10:
Answer: "Complex narrative with several key points."
Critique: "Everything beyond first sentence is inaccurate."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (What IS accurate then? Need source to know what to write)

**Your task:**
Apply the test literally. Think about what the critique implies. Can you write a better answer using ONLY the question, current answer, and critique?

Format your response as:
Rationale: [Explain whether you can or cannot improve the answer without the source, and why. If you can improve it, briefly state how.]
Classification: [Constructive or Non-Constructive]

Question:
{question}

Answer:

## Sample Examples

### Non-Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Non-Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What happens to the child?

**Answer**: The child drowns and the priest ignores his plea for help.

**Critique**: More background detail needs to be added to this to explain how and why the child was drowning. 

**Rationale**: The critique requests additional background detail to explain how and why the child was drowning. However, it does not provide any specific information or implications about what those details might be. Without access to the source material, it is impossible to know what specific background details should be added to improve the answer. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize all their previous sliding experience.

**Answer**: They seem to have gone sledding many times before. They fixed their sleds with electrical tape many times before too. Victor had a more beaten up sled. They have done it alone before with no adults around.

**Critique**: This sentence is unnecessary and should be omitted.

**Rationale**: The critique states that "this sentence is unnecessary and should be omitted," but it does not specify which sentence is being referred to. Since the answer contains multiple sentences, it is unclear which one should be removed. Without knowing which specific sentence is deemed unnecessary, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to determine which sentence is unnecessary.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about damage-scaling procs?

**Answer**: For this, they will be making changes to IPS status effects and proc damage calculation. Their primary goal is improving Impact and Puncture. Currently, Impact inflicts a staggering effect, Puncture reduces the enemy’s damage output by 30%, and Slash inflicts bleed damage.

**Critique**: The response could use clearer language.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response could use clearer language but does not specify which parts are unclear or how to improve them. Without specific guidance on what needs clarification or how to rephrase the content, it is not possible to make a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique does not provide enough information to rewrite the answer in a clearer way without referring back to the source material for context or additional details.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the surprise in the plot.

**Answer**: The surprise in the plot is that the captain is still alive.

**Critique**: This isn't the surprise

**Rationale**: The critique states that the provided answer is incorrect by saying "This isn't the surprise," but it does not provide any information or implication about what the actual surprise is. Without knowing what the correct surprise is, I cannot improve the answer. I would need to refer back to the source material to determine the true surprise in the plot.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the qualities that make a good cook?

**Answer**: No answer

**Critique**: The answer is implied. By taking the issues that the narrator was talking about, one can discern the opposite of traits that make a good cook.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the qualities of a good cook are implied by the issues discussed by the narrator, and that one can infer the opposite traits to determine what makes a good cook. However, without specific details or examples of these issues, it is not possible to discern what those opposite traits are. The critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand what issues the narrator was discussing.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about Sabara's dictatorial tendencies?

**Answer**: Sabara was a military officer and governor. He was appointed to the position of governor of Southeast Sulawesi in 1966. He was initially intended to serve just one term, but due to a lack of replacement candidates, he was extended for several months. He was appointed acting governor of Central Kalimantan in 1983. He was known by journalists as being the "acting governor specialist" in the early 1980s.

**Critique**: The answer given is off. It has nothing to do with the question asked. It should simply say the text says nothing about Sabara having dictatorial tendencies.

**Rationale**: The critique provides a clear directive on how to improve the answer. It explicitly states that the text should indicate that there is no mention of Sabara having dictatorial tendencies. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by simply stating that the article does not address Sabara's dictatorial tendencies.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the role of Kristine Lucius in the news.

**Answer**: Kristine Lucius is the executive vice president for policy and government affairs at the Leadership Conference. According to the passage, she criticized Senate Republicans for getting through young, unqualified conservative judges too quickly. She also said the judges are likely to dismantle reproductive rights, marriage equality, and the separation of church and state.

**Critique**: The answer omits Lucius' criticism that two of the judges wouldn't state that they agreed with the Brown v. Board of Education 1954 Supreme Court decision that ruled racial segregation of public schools unconstitutional.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the answer to improve it. It mentions a particular criticism by Kristine Lucius regarding two judges and their stance on the Brown v. Board of Education decision. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by including this specific detail about her criticism.

**Classification**: Constructive

---

#### Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the narrator?

**Answer**: The narrator is a sergeant in the army. He has a spouse, a caring family, medals to his name, and a desire to live. The sergeant had men under his command for three years before Operation Neptune sent them to a beachhead to fight the Germans. He made it out to the lagoon but fell into the water and lost consciousness. The sergeant was rescued by a British company steamrolling through the coastline picking up survivors and POWs.  

**Critique**: He is also loyal to his men

**Rationale**: The critique provides additional information about the narrator's character, specifically mentioning his loyalty to his men. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding this detail to the existing description of the narrator. The critique implies that the narrator's loyalty is an important aspect of his character that should be included.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Grewal's political career. 

**Answer**: Grewal is a Liberal MP for the southern Ontario riding of Brampton East. He is a lawyer. He was the chair of the House of Commons finance committee, but stepped down from his position in November of 2018. He is a member of the House of Commons ethics committee.

**Critique**: Grewal was never mentioned as being the chairman of the committee. He didn't step down, he was moved off. He is also not a member of the ethics committee.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections to the current answer, indicating that Grewal was not the chairman of the committee, he was moved off rather than stepping down, and he is not a member of the ethics committee. These corrections allow for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The editor can revise the answer to remove the incorrect information about Grewal's roles and actions.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about retaliation against Greenhouse?

**Answer**: The Army Corps of Engineers demoted Greenhouse, stripped her of her security clearance, and sent her to a remote cubicle after she spoke up about the KBR contract. When she filed a whistleblower lawsuit, someone placed a trip wire around her cubicle, permanently damaging her knee. Greenhouse's settlement from the lawsuit was $970,000.

**Critique**: The last sentence does not pertain to the retaliation against her.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the last sentence about Greenhouse's settlement does not relate to the topic of retaliation against her. This implies that the sentence should be removed to improve the focus of the answer. The critique provides enough information to make this specific change without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the old homeless man?

**Answer**: The old homeless man is a heron addict who lost his job as a news anchor after his wife left him for the best man at their wedding. The old man seems to be in a steady state, though; he's been collecting trash for months and his diet has made a massive contribution to his psychotic eyes (similar to a rat who has been neglected for years). His black lab has been trying to instill a sense of purpose in him, to no avail.

**Critique**: It is not stated that the old man seems to be in a steady state, though; he's been collecting trash for months and his diet has made a massive contribution to his psychotic eyes (similar to a rat who has been neglected for years); his black lab has been trying to instill a sense of purpose in him, to no avail.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that certain details in the answer are not stated in the story. However, it does not provide any information on what should be included instead or what the story actually says about the old homeless man.

### Sample 4/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

In what way has the term "aquapelago" expanded from scientific to cultural?

**Answer**: The original definition of aquapelago introduced by Philip Hayward specified their applicability to island communities. Over time, the concept has expanded to consider the role of marine spaces in metropolitan locales, the influences of media-lore on perceptions of the marine environment, and participation in world-making through the imaginary.

**Critique**: This doesn't make sense. 

**Rationale**: The critique "This doesn't make sense" does not provide any specific information or guidance on how to improve the answer. It does not indicate what part of the answer is unclear or incorrect, nor does it suggest what a correct or clearer version might include. Without additional details or implications from the critique, it is impossible to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Critique**: The answer should mention that Rachel is Devyn's sister

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the answer to improve it.

### Sample 6/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize why Democrats think their policies on voting procedures are right, according to the author.

**Answer**: According to the author, Democrats believe their policies on voting procedures are right because they are concerned primarily with preventing voter suppression, not fraud. Thus, any attempt by Homeland Security to investigate voter fraud, even though such fraud has been documented, would be seen as disenfranchisement by Democrats. Furthermore, Democrats want a Special Counsel to probe Trump's alleged collusion with Russia - despite no evidence to support those claims - and see that investigation as a justification for DHS not to investigate voter fraud.

**Critique**: The Democrats don't see the investigation about Russia as a justification for DHS to not investigate voter fraud. That part is made up. However, the answer can mention that the author thinks the Democrats are being selective in their desire to investigate elections.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the part about Democrats seeing the Russia investigation as a justification for DHS not to investigate voter fraud is incorrect and should be removed. Additionally, it suggests including the author's view that Democrats are being selective in their desire to investigate elections. This guidance allows for a clear revision of the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 8/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the overall reception towards Forza Horizon 6.

**Answer**: The game received mostly positive reviews. The critics praised the game's graphics, immersive and expansive modes for single players, captivating multiplayer options, a rewarding economy, and a staggering amount of cars and tracks. The critics also praised the game's new night driving and rain effects. The game is also a no-brainer "gotta have it" title for those that have Microsoft's gaming machine in their homes.

**Critique**: The response includes extraneous information not useful for the task.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response includes extraneous information but does not specify which parts are unnecessary. Without knowing which specific details are considered extraneous, it is impossible to determine what should be removed or adjusted. Therefore, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand what is essential for summarizing the overall reception.

Explain what the narrator is and has become.

**Answer**: The narrator has had a heart transplant due to cardiac failure and will go into cardiac arrest without it.

**Critique**: There's no mention of a cardiac arrest or heart attack the narrator suffered previously.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the current answer incorrectly mentions a cardiac arrest or heart attack, which is not supported by the source material. However, the critique does not provide any information on what the narrator actually is or has become, nor does it suggest any specific corrections or additions to the answer. Without additional information from the source, it is not possible to improve the answer based solely on the critique provided.

### Sample 11/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what happened to Alexa, and why she sent the narrator the packages.

**Answer**: Two packages were sent to the narrator. The first was a letter from Alexa and a box that was wrapped in plain paper. 
The box's contents were faded memories of their childhood, and underneath it was the narrator's own diary. In this, the narrator would learn that Alexa had cancer and she was trying to tell the narrator that she loved him so that he would be able to move on, even after she passed away. Conversely, that Alexa was probably also trying to induce jealousy in the narrator-if he truly loved her as she claimed, why wouldn't he have met with her?

**Critique**: The contents and the commentary about jealousy are made up. It'd be better if the answer was scrapped.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the information about the contents of the packages and the commentary about jealousy are fabricated. However, it does not provide any specific details or corrections about what actually happened to Alexa or why she sent the packages. Without knowing the correct information, I cannot improve the answer. The critique suggests scrapping the answer, but it does not provide enough information to construct a new, accurate answer without referring back to the source material.

### Sample 12/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about gamers?

**Answer**: The article says that gamers are uneducated and ignorant. They don't understand that the inclusion of women in Battlefield V is a plausible scenario.

**Critique**: The response should clarify that this is what the game developer said in response to a specific group of gamers.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the statement about gamers being uneducated and ignorant is attributed to the game developer's response to a specific group of gamers. This allows the editor to revise the answer to accurately reflect the source of the statement without needing to refer back to the original article.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 13/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Daisy's relationship with Louis?

**Answer**: Daisy was married to Louis for four years. They had breakfast each morning before Louis goes to work and then watches TV together after dinner. He supported and was sorry for her every act that was caused by either clumsiness or accidents. Daisy fantasizes about how Louis took care of her after her injury accidents. Louis is murdered by Daisy, but according to her hallucination, he wasn't murdered by her. |

**Critique**: Louis taking care of Daisy doesn't seem to be fantasies. That's made up.

**Rationale**: The critique specifically addresses the part of the answer that mentions Daisy fantasizing about Louis taking care of her after her injury accidents, stating that this is made up. This implies that the part about fantasies should be removed or corrected. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the incorrect statement about fantasies without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 15/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about midwives? 

**Answer**: The role of the midwives is to help people battling the disease overcome their fear. According to the United Nations Population Fund, this can help reduce the stigma in communities as individuals would not withhold their kids from going to a clinic. The reason being is that they may associate the clinic with the disease.

**Critique**: The response includes information that is not mentioned in the text.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response includes information not mentioned in the text, but it does not specify which parts of the answer are incorrect or what the correct information should be. Without knowing what the text actually says about midwives, I cannot determine which parts of the answer to change or what to replace them with. Therefore, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

### Sample 16/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about drugs?

**Answer**: The narrator had turned to drugs to find happiness, after struggling with a very lonely, depression-ridden year. He compares the alternative of using drugs to turning to ordinary things in the real world which makes them happy. Drugs seem to be an extremely prevalent addiction for young people nowadays. The narrator adds that he might use drugs again, but not as a crutch to find happiness-a clear sign of this sudden maturity.

**Critique**: It is not stated that drugs seem to be an extremely prevalent addiction for young people nowadays. 

**Rationale**: The critique specifically points out that the statement about drugs being an extremely prevalent addiction for young people is not stated in the article. This implies that this part of the answer should be removed or revised. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the unsupported statement about the prevalence of drug addiction among young people.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 17/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Discuss Pederson's role in the Eagle's comeback.

**Answer**: They were successful because of Doug Pederson. The Philadelphia Eagles' coaching coach was excellent. Pederson was able to get his team out of bed on days when they didn't want to, which is significant. It splits the difference in the game. Pedersons told Wentz to let the offense work for him and led to impressive results. The Philadelphia Eagles had players lined up who were injured but because of Pederson's coaching, they had the win.

**Critique**: It is not stated that Pederson was able to get his team out of bed on days when they didn't want to, which is significant.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about Pederson getting his team out of bed on days they didn't want to is not accurate. This implies that this part of the answer should be removed or corrected. However, the critique does not provide any information on what should replace this statement or what Pederson's actual role was, beyond what is already mentioned in the answer. Therefore, without additional information from the source, it is not possible to improve the answer based solely on the critique.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 18/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What happens after the stag finds Lucy again?

**Answer**: When the stag finds Lucy again, he realizes that she has transformed into a doe of flesh and bone. The stag allows the boy to spend time with him, and eventually covers himself in leaves so that the boy is not scared. The stag eventually buries Lucy, and returns to the forest with the boy.

**Critique**: "When the stag finds Lucy again, he realizes that she has transformed into a doe of flesh and bone." - this is inaccurate. The Stag knew what befell Lucy even before he found her again. When he found her 365 years later, she was already dead. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that corrects the inaccuracies in the original answer. It states that the stag already knew what happened to Lucy before finding her again and that when he found her 365 years later, she was already dead. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the incorrect transformation detail and adjusting the timeline and events accordingly.

### Sample 19/50 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Whistler's activities during the 1970s.

**Answer**: The year Whistler first came to Samoa was during 1970.

**Critique**: The answer omits almost everything Whistler did in the 70s.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is missing significant information about Whistler's activities during the 1970s. However, it does not provide any specific details or suggestions about what those activities might be. Without additional information or specific activities mentioned, I cannot improve the answer. I would need to refer back to the source material to know what to include about Whistler's activities during that decade.

**Answer**: Sharon is going to pretend that nothing happened and that Mike is still alive.

**Critique**: It is not stated nor implied that Sharon is going to pretend that nothing happened and that Mike is still alive.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer is incorrect because it is neither stated nor implied that Sharon will pretend nothing happened and that Mike is still alive. However, the critique does not provide any information or implications about what Sharon will actually do to get out of the situation.

Why is it hard for critics to accept that Mikhail Lesin killed himself?

**Answer**: It is common knowledge that Lesin was surrounded by controversy at the time of his death.
All other information in regards to his death has been scrubbed from the public record.

**Critique**: The response is a little vague and needs more details. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response is vague and needs more details, but it does not provide any specific information or guidance on what details should be added.

However, Michael noticed that Irene stopped smiling as much as she used to, and she eventually left him for another man.

**Critique**: The response misses to specify that Michael and Irene were married for ten years.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the current answer to improve it. It specifies the duration of Michael and Irene's marriage, which is a concrete detail that can be included without needing to refer back to the source material. By adding "They were married for ten years" to the answer, the relationship summary becomes more complete.

**Critique**: There is no evidence the album contains six tracks, so remove this.

**Rationale**: The critique specifically points out that the statement about the album containing six tracks is not supported by evidence.

What does the excerpt say about the Columbus Invitational?

**Answer**: The Columbus Invitational was a golf tournament played in Columbus, Ohio at two different golf courses. It was sponsored by the Zooligans, a non-profit organization that raised funds for the Columbus zoo. The winners won prizes and a share of the money.

**Critique**: There's no evidence in the passage that suggest that the Zooligans were a non-profit organization.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that there is no evidence in the passage to support the claim that the Zooligans were a non-profit organization. This implies that the statement about the Zooligans being a non-profit should be removed or revised. However, the critique does not provide an alternative description or confirm what the correct information should be regarding the Zooligans. Therefore, without additional information from the source, we cannot confidently improve the answer beyond removing the unsupported claim.

### Sample 28/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story have to say about the mom's feelings about Ray after the accident?

**Answer**: After the accident, Ray's mom refuses to accept the fact that Ray might have died. She becomes a shell of a mother, totally devoted to Ray's recovery. Within her refusal to accept the truth, she traps herself in the horrid memories and loatheside of Ray's state. The story says that it's almost like Ray is still alive, being dependent on life support and ventilator.

**Critique**: It is incorrect to describe Ray's mom as 'a shell of a mother' or trapped in horrid memories. Nor it is the case that it's almost like Ray is still alive (rather, she thinks of him as still alive)

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections to the current answer. It indicates that the description of Ray's mom as "a shell of a mother" and "trapped in horrid memories" is incorrect, and it clarifies that she thinks of Ray as still alive, rather than it being almost like he is still alive. With these specific points, I can improve the answer by removing the incorrect descriptions and adjusting the phrasing to reflect that Ray's mom actively thinks of him as still alive.

**Critique**: The answer should make it clear that the article does not say anything about circular logic.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the article does not mention circular logic.

### Sample 30/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the main news event.

**Answer**: The New York Senate has attempted to criminalize cyberbullying by defining it vaguely and omitting a definition altogether. Any attempt to enforce such a law as written would most likely be unconstitutional, resulting in its demise. The law is purely cynical and designed to game the emotions of the electorate.

**Critique**: "by defining it vaguely and omitting a definition altogether" is a contradiction

**Rationale**: The critique points out a contradiction in the answer, specifically the phrase "by defining it vaguely and omitting a definition altogether." This implies that the answer should be revised to either state that the law is defined vaguely or that it omits a definition, but not both. This is a clear directive on how to improve the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

What does the story say about making the documentary The Secret Policeman?

**Answer**: It was a documentary about an undercover reporter that reveals racism among police recruits in Manchester, England. 

**Critique**: The response should be much more specific and include more details. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer lacks specificity and detail but does not provide any specific information or details that should be included. Without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to improve the answer to meet the critique's requirements. The critique does not imply or suggest any specific content that could be added to enhance the answer. Therefore, the critique is non-constructive because it does not provide enough information to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Answer**: The company has released an update to improve the system. They want players to know that they were aiming to improve the system. They also want to know how players see their final intentions and what they can do to improve.

**Critique**: The response repeats itself.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the response is repetitive, which implies that the answer could be made more concise by removing redundant information. Specifically, the sentence "They want players to know that they were aiming to improve the system" is essentially a repetition of the first sentence. Therefore, the answer can be improved by removing this redundancy, making it more concise and focused. This can be done without needing to refer back to the source material.

The company admits some paperwork violations but denies any fines were assessed and is defending its practices. Meanwhile, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has launched an investigation into the Kushner Cos. business practices, which is still ongoing.

**Critique**: It wasn't Kushner who spoke against NYC's statements. It was a spokeswoman for Kushner Cos., Christine Taylor.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It clarifies that it was not Jared Kushner himself who spoke against the NYC Department of Buildings' statements, but rather a spokeswoman for Kushner Cos., Christine Taylor. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the attribution of the statement.

**Answer**: In the story, he attends an unnamed college, but it is implied as a university. No other information is given so it is also implied to be on or near the Taylor Mall.

**Critique**: This response is not accurate as there are some descriptions provided about the college/university in the original passage. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer is inaccurate because the original passage contains descriptions of the college/university that are not included in the answer. However, the critique does not specify what those descriptions are. Without knowing the specific details or descriptions from the source material, I cannot improve the answer. I would need to refer back to the original passage to know what to include about the college/university.

**Answer**: No answer

**Critique**: The answer is implied. By taking the issues that the narrator was talking about, one can discern the opposite of traits that make a good cook.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the qualities of a good cook are implied by the issues discussed by the narrator, and that one can infer the opposite traits to determine what makes a good cook. However, without specific details or examples of these issues, it is not possible to discern what those opposite traits are. The critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand what issues the narrator was discussing.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should indicate that the information is not available, implying that the current answer is speculative. However, it does not provide specific guidance on how to improve the answer beyond stating that the information is unavailable. Without additional context or details, I cannot concretely improve the answer to reflect the critique's suggestion.

**Critique**: War does not have values and this is not the theme

**Rationale**: The critique states that "war does not have values and this is not the theme," indicating that the current answer is incorrect. However, it does not provide any information about what the actual theme of the story is. Without knowing the correct theme, I cannot improve the answer.

**Critique**: The story doesn't offer a clue about why the protagonist behaves the way he does.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the story doesn't offer a clue about why the protagonist behaves the way he does. This critique does not provide any specific information or suggestions on how to improve the answer. It simply negates the current answer without offering an alternative explanation or direction.

They appear to be mostly cowardly men, able to fire at the enemy but unable to endure the pain with patience when wounded.

**Critique**: None of this is extant in the story

**Rationale**: The critique states that none of the information provided in the answer is present in the story. However, it does not provide any guidance or information on what the correct details about the sergeant's squad should be. Without knowing what is actually in the story, I cannot improve the answer.

**Answer**: Semi-billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk announced on Saturday (Jan. 27) that the first launch of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket would be on Feb. 6 from Launch Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Falcon Heavy is a much-anticipated orbital rocket that is being touted as being the most powerful since NASA's Saturn V moon rocket. On its inaugural launch, the Falcon Heavy is carrying Musk's Tesla Roadster into heliocentric orbit. Musk cautioned though that there is a good chance the launch could fail. The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex has unveiled packages for viewing this upcoming launch from ground level.

**Critique**: It is not stated that Elon Musk is a semi-billionaire entrepreneur. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the description of Elon Musk as a "semi-billionaire entrepreneur" is not stated by him. This implies that this part of the answer should be removed or corrected, as it is not a direct statement from Musk. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to improve the answer by removing the unsupported claim about Musk's financial status.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the main news event.

**Answer**: The Republican-controlled Senate confirmed 13 of President Donald Trump's lifetime judicial nominees this week. The confirmations were done at breakneck speed in the last weeks before the Senate breaks following a voice vote with little opposition from Democrats. In mainstream media the news has been overshadowed by the 2020 Democratic presidential debates. Two of the candidates that have been confirmed would not say they agreed with the bedrock civil rights decision Brown v. Board of Education. The Republicans hope that the new judges will help to dismantle reproductive rights, marriage equality and shred the New Deal.

**Critique**: Dismantling reproductive rights, marriage equality, and shredding the New Deal is what the Progressives fear the Republicans will do. The Republicans made no statement corroborating the framing favored by the Progressives.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the statement about dismantling reproductive rights, marriage equality, and shredding the New Deal reflects the fears of Progressives, not the stated intentions of Republicans. This implies that the answer should be revised to accurately represent the perspectives involved, without attributing intentions to the Republicans that they have not expressed. Therefore, the answer can be improved by rephrasing the last sentence to reflect the critique's clarification.

He made it out to the lagoon but fell into the water and lost consciousness. The sergeant was rescued by a British company steamrolling through the coastline picking up survivors and POWs.  

**Critique**: He is also loyal to his men

**Rationale**: The critique provides additional information about the narrator's character, specifically mentioning his loyalty to his men.
