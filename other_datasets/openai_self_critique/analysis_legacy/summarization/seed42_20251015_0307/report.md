## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating the QUALITY of a critique given a question and an answer.

A CONSTRUCTIVE critique must provide SPECIFIC information about what to change or add. Ask yourself: "Does this critique tell me what the answer should say or what specifically needs to be fixed?"

**CONSTRUCTIVE examples (tells you WHAT to change):**
- "This is false. She would have been 18 or 19" → You know to change the age to 18 or 19 ✅
- "The description of picking the yellow flower is incorrect" → You know that specific part is wrong ✅
- "The baby belongs to the narrator is inaccurate" → You know the baby doesn't belong to narrator ✅
- "It's omitted that the child was crushed under a roof" → You know to add this fact ✅
- "Some people are worried due to the virus" → You know what the answer should say ✅
- "Unnecessarily wordy" → You know to remove extra words ✅
- "Should be a full sentence" → You know to rewrite as complete sentence ✅
- "The last sentence is repetitive" → You know which sentence to remove/revise ✅

**NON-CONSTRUCTIVE examples (too vague, doesn't tell you what to change):**
- "The first sentence should be rewritten because it's inaccurate" → What should it say instead? ❌
- "Left out key happenings" → What happenings? What to add? ❌
- "Description is too simple" → What details to add? ❌
- "Needs more analysis" → What analysis? ❌
- "Could be more accurate" → How? What's inaccurate? ❌
- "This is wrong" → What specifically is wrong? ❌
- "Should consider correcting this" → Correct to what? ❌

**Test for constructiveness:** Can you improve the answer based ONLY on the critique, without re-reading the source material?
- If YES (critique gives you the fix or identifies the specific problematic part) → Constructive ✅
- If NO (need source to know what to add/fix) → Non-Constructive ❌

Special case:
- If the answer is already correct and the critique says "correct" or "no issues" → CONSTRUCTIVE ✅

Your rationale should conclude with ONE of these:
- "The critique specifies [what is wrong or what to change]" → Constructive
- "The critique only identifies a problem without specifying what to change" → Non-Constructive

Format your response EXACTLY as:
Rationale: [Your reasoning here]

## Sample Examples

### Non-Constructive Samples (5 shown)

#### Non-Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is the civilian ship empty?

**Answer**: It turns out that Roger murdered Drake and then went mad killing everyone on board.

**Critique**: Although Roger killed Drake, it's not true that he went mad and killed everyone on board. The model's answer is inaccurate, insufficient, and should provide relevant and correct details from the story to answer the question.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies that the part about Roger going mad and killing everyone on board is inaccurate, but it does not specify what the correct details are or what should be included in the answer. It points out the inaccuracy but does not provide specific information on what the answer should say instead. Therefore, the critique only identifies a problem without specifying what to change.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the opinions of the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School?

**Answer**: The students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where the Parkland shooting occurred, do not agree with the movie and video game industry, placing the blame on the inaction of inactive politicians and the National Rifle Association, demanding gun-control reform.

**Critique**: The first sentence of the answer should be rewritten because it says the students disagree with the movie and video game industry; meanwhile, the text does not indicate such. The model's answer changes the meaning from the text and is inaccurate and should consider correcting this.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the first sentence of the answer inaccurately states that the students disagree with the movie and video game industry, which is not indicated in the text. However, it does not specify what the sentence should say instead or what the correct information is. The critique also mentions that the model's answer changes the meaning from the text and is inaccurate, but it does not provide specific guidance on how to correct it. Therefore, the critique only identifies a problem without specifying what to change.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why do the police keep almost summoning "Pee Man"?

**Answer**: [rewrite]

#### Non-Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What are the three possible approaches that music directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment?

**Answer**: a capella, instruments doubling the vocal lines, or a basso continuo

**Critique**: A little explanation of the approaches would have made the response much better.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer could be improved with additional explanation, but it does not specify what information should be added or how the explanation should be expanded. It identifies a problem (lack of explanation) without providing specific guidance on what to change or add.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Discuss LaFleur's play calls.

**Answer**: LaFleur made several questionable decisions. He had 4th & 2 from the Eagles 13-yard line, with his team leading 10-7. The Packers had been moving up and down the field. LaFleur took a page straight from the Sean McVay playbook and kicked the FG. That gave the Packers a whopping 13-7 lead. Where is the aggression? Why wouldn’t you trust Aaron Rodgers to make a play there? If you fail, you’re still up 10-7. LaFleur made some questionable play-calls.

**Critique**: A lot of the response is lifted from the passage.

**Rationale**: The critique states that "a lot of the response is lifted from the passage," but it does not specify which parts are directly taken from the passage or suggest how to address the issue. Without knowing which specific parts are lifted, it is not possible to revise the answer to avoid this problem. Therefore, the critique does not provide specific guidance on what to change or how to improve the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

They believe the Democrats are letting Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump do this to consolidate their power and are counting on the voters to stop them. The Democratic Party, in some cases, appears to be acquiescing.

**Critique**: The Republicans are stated to believe Democrats are letting McConnell and Trump do their thing to consolidate their power, which is made up.

They were built in 1930 and secured underground with steel encased in concrete with ventilation pipes and steel plates to prevent damage from aerial bombardment. Primož's military tunnels were destroyed by German forces in 1944.

**Critique**: "totaling 5.2 kilometers" - it was never mentioned exactly how long the tunnels were in the text.

### Sample 9/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer?

**Answer**: Jerry grew up a loner and had a strong hatred of guns. Unbeknownst to others around them, the victim usually revealed he had a problem that could be fixed, which led to their death. Jerry does not torture his victims, but makes their deaths quick and painless. Jerry tearfully kills his victims after bonding with them first. These factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer.

**Critique**: None of these factors led to Jerry being a serial killer. This should be omitted. Additionally, the answer should be in speculative terms as it's not stated explicitly in the text.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the factors mentioned in the answer did not lead to Jerry becoming a serial killer and suggests that these should be omitted. It also advises that the answer should be framed in speculative terms, indicating a need to change the tone of the answer. This provides specific guidance on what to change in the answer.

### Sample 10/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the cost effectiveness of Aldi?

**Answer**: The secret to Aldi's success is that they offered a few hundred well chosen product lines at low prices and they followed a military style of organization. 

**Critique**: It is omitted that low prices are made possible by massive purchasing. This was combined with a high ratio of sales per square meter of floor space, and ferocious cost control — the latter being Theo’s special skill. Little money was wasted on marketing, and none at all on making Aldi stores look elegant: goods were simply piled up along the aisles in packing cases.


**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the answer omits specific details about how Aldi achieves cost effectiveness. It mentions the role of massive purchasing, high sales per square meter, ferocious cost control, minimal marketing expenses, and the simple presentation of goods. These are specific elements that should be added to the answer to improve it.

What does the article say about de Villa's opinion on public health?

**Critique**: Additional detail about how De Villa's whole career is around public health issues should be stated. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests adding information about De Villa's career focus on public health issues but does not specify what specific details or statements should be included in the answer. It identifies a potential area for expansion but does not provide specific guidance on what to change or add to the existing answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 12/50 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Primož's strategic importance.

**Answer**: Primož is part of a ridge which separates the Pivka basin from the Reka valley. It possesses a commanding view over the entire Pivka basin, making it an important military location. During the Second World War, it was fortified with tunnels as part of the Alpine Wall, yet they were never used in combat. In total, the tunnels were more than two kilometers long, but they have since been abandoned. Today, it is made accessible by marked trails, with one specifically designated for tourists and containing numerous information signs around its peak. Primož's strategic importance stems from its commanding view and its military tunnels.

**Critique**: "which separates" - change to "that separates"

**Rationale**: The critique specifies a grammatical change from "which separates" to "that separates," indicating a specific part of the sentence to be corrected.

**Classification**: Constructive

Daniel thinks that it looks like melted ice cream. The voices behind the machine tell Daniel that they are messengers, that the creature is one of those who represent them. The creature is multiple creatures and they are here as messengers. It says that Daniel's emissions are a beacon to something or someone dangerous.

**Critique**: Lacking movement only applies to the beginning, so this sentence can be rephrased to reflect that it's situational.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the description of the creature lacking movement should be rephrased to indicate that this characteristic is only applicable at the beginning, suggesting a situational context. This provides specific guidance on how to adjust the sentence to accurately reflect the story's details.

**Classification**: Constructive

The day after Trump's State of the Union address was dominated by an extraordinary series of developments in which the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice challenged Trump both on the record and through what appeared to be anonymous leaks to CNN. The Republican attacks have been encouraged by increasingly conspiratorial Fox coverage centred on what hosts have called a "Deep State" attempting to topple Trump.

**Critique**: The answer omits that Trump's allegations are due to the FBI probe investigating his ties with Russia regarding the 2016 presidential elections.

**Answer**: The narrator can be described as a keen and careful sergeant in the army with a caring family, who sacrifices his wellbeing as well as that of his men for the greater good. He is valiant and resourceful, and he is committed to his men for the time being, commanding their lives in the shells of their rifles. He is conflicted by the fact that he unwillingly leads the men, who stand shoulder by shoulder to the slaughter with camaraderie, pride, fear, and anger. He also admires his foe, the Germans, for their bravery and tenacity. The narrator is also confident that he will not die with the Germans because he is a lucky man. His spirit dwindles as the Germans begin unleashing massive weaponry and his fellows are being killed left and right. In the end, he falls into the water, where he is saved by the British soldiers.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about mental illness?

**Answer**: The man seems to suffer from schizophrenia. He cannot stop staring at the floor, at the time where the story takes place, the carpet. He is found in an institution after a mental breakdown from not being in control of his own life. He isn't able to distinguish what is a hallucination and what isn't. He seems to get lost in it and feels a sense of panic.

**Critique**: The story does not say anything specific about mental illness and the answer's suggestion the main character suffers from schizophrenia is completely unfounded.

It also points out that the main character might be obsessive about the carpet color, indicating what part of the answer is incorrect and what the story actually suggests.

What does the text say about the weather and the number of deaths in Chicago?

**Answer**: In Chicago, a historic and deadly cold snap gripped a wide swath of the nation on Wednesday, fueled by the polar vortex, with temperatures plunging far below zero and wind chill numbers as extraordinary as they are dangerous. The temperature in Chicago tumbled to 21 below Wednesday morning, a record for the date, and closing in on the city's all-time record of minus-27 set in 1985. That record could fall on Thursday.

**Critique**: The highlighted text is a description of the extreme weather affecting a wide swath of the nation, not just "in Chicago", which makes this part of the response contradictory. It should be revised to reflect the fact that Chicago is affected. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the description of the weather is not limited to Chicago, as the answer suggests, but rather affects a wide swath of the nation. It specifies that the response should be revised to accurately reflect that Chicago is part of a larger area affected by the extreme weather.

France's announcement resolved uncertainty over the fate of the two recorders after Germany's BFU said it had declined a request to handle them because it could not process the new type of recorder used on the 737 MAX jets. Brazil, Mexico, and Panama are the first Latin American nations to suspend the Boeing 737 MAX. Panama's Copa Airlines had suspended operations of its six Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft until the findings are published of an investigation into the Sunday's crash.

**Critique**: The question's wording, "non-American countries", should be interpreted as "countries that aren't on a continent named America". Thus, Latin American countries shouldn't be mentioned.

LaFleur took a page straight from the Sean McVay playbook and kicked the FG. That gave the Packers a whopping 13-7 lead. Where is the aggression?

**Critique**: A lot of the response is lifted from the passage.

**Rationale**: The critique states that "a lot of the response is lifted from the passage," but it does not specify which parts are directly taken from the passage or suggest how to address the issue.
