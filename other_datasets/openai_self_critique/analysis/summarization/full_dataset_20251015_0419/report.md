## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating whether a critique is CONSTRUCTIVE or NON-CONSTRUCTIVE.

**Definition from first principles:**

A critique is CONSTRUCTIVE if and only if it provides ENOUGH INFORMATION to improve the answer WITHOUT needing to go back to the source material.

**The test (apply this literally):**
Imagine you are an editor who CANNOT see the original source text. You only have:
1. The question
2. The current answer  
3. The critique

Can you make a CONCRETE improvement to the answer using just these three things?

- If YES (you can write a better answer) → CONSTRUCTIVE
- If NO (you need to read the source to know what to write) → NON-CONSTRUCTIVE

**Important: Think creatively about implications**
Some critiques don't explicitly tell you what to do but strongly imply it:
- "Jerry does not leave" → Remove the part about Jerry leaving (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "We don't know the narrator's gender" → Use "they" instead of "he/she" (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "The sentence is unnecessary" but multiple sentences exist → Which sentence? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "Second sentence is irrelevant" → Remove the second sentence (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "First seven chapters are suitable for undergrad, book as a whole for grad students" → Implies chapters 8+ exceed novice (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "Statement cannot be confirmed and spelling is incorrect" → Fix spelling, remove unconfirmed statement (CONSTRUCTIVE)

**Critical distinctions:**
1. If answer is ALREADY GOOD and critique just confirms it ("accurate description", "correct answer"):
   → CONSTRUCTIVE (action = keep as is, no changes needed)

2. If critique says something is WRONG but doesn't tell you what's RIGHT:
   - "Everything beyond first sentence is inaccurate" → What IS accurate? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
   - "This cannot be confirmed" → What CAN be confirmed? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
   
3. If critique IMPLIES what's correct through contrast:
   - "First seven for undergrad, whole book for grad" → Clearly implies 8+ are advanced (CONSTRUCTIVE)
   - "Cannot be confirmed + spelling wrong" → Fix spelling + remove unconfirmed part (CONSTRUCTIVE)

**Examples to illustrate the principle:**

Example 1:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Could also mention the organizations she founded."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Which organizations? Need the source)

Example 2:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Should mention she founded UNESCO and WHO."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Specific organizations provided)

Example 3:
Question: "Why did she donate?"
Answer: "She was born in China."
Critique: "She was born in California, not China."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Doesn't help answer WHY she donated; need source for the reason)

Example 4:
Answer: "The narrator is a keen sergeant. He admires the Germans. He is confident he will survive."
Critique: "The second sentence is irrelevant."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove the second sentence)

Example 5:
Answer: "Jerry and Brian are happy, but when Janice dies, Brian cries and Jerry leaves."
Critique: "Jerry does not leave."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove or correct the part about Jerry leaving)

Example 6:
Answer: "The narrator lives in a small house. She wants to leave."
Critique: "We don't know the narrator's gender."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Change "she" to "they")

Example 7:
Answer: "Accurate, detailed description of the setting."
Critique: "The description is accurate."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Confirms answer is good; action = keep as is)

Example 8:
Question: "What chapters exceed novice level?"
Answer: "The first seven chapters."
Critique: "First seven are for undergrads, whole book for grad students."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Implies chapters 8+ exceed novice)

Example 9:
Answer: "Primoš is in urban area. Has trails and museum."
Critique: "Urban area statement cannot be confirmed. Spelling of Primož is wrong."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Fix spelling, remove unconfirmed statement)

Example 10:
Answer: "Complex narrative with several key points."
Critique: "Everything beyond first sentence is inaccurate."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (What IS accurate then? Need source to know what to write)

**Your task:**
Apply the test literally. Think about what the critique implies. Can you write a better answer using ONLY the question, current answer, and critique?

Format your response as:
Rationale: [Explain whether you can or cannot improve the answer without the source, and why. If you can improve it, briefly state how.]
Classification: [Constructive or Non-Constructive]

Question:
{question}

Answer:

#### Unexpected Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What were Salucci's twenty years as court architect of Wurttemberg like?

**Answer**: Salucci was appointed court architect in 1818. He built the Royal Pavilion in Weil near Esslingen in collaboration with the Queen Catherine of Wurttemberg. After her death, he built her Wurttemberg Mausoleum. He also designed the Schloss Rosenstein. He was dismissed in 1839 after a dispute with a superior. Dry rot was discovered in the castle in 1839, and Salucci was made responsible.

**Critique**: The response summarizes Salucci's time bit misses to describe it as a challenging time.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that Salucci's twenty years as court architect were challenging, which is an evaluative statement about his experience. While the critique does not provide specific details on why it was challenging, it implies that the existing answer should be adjusted to reflect this perspective. The current answer mentions a dispute and being held responsible for dry rot, which can be interpreted as challenges. Therefore, the answer can be improved by explicitly stating that these events contributed to a challenging period for Salucci. For example, the answer could be revised to: "Salucci's twenty years as court architect of Wurttemberg were challenging. He was appointed in 1818 and collaborated with Queen Catherine on the Royal Pavilion in Weil near Esslingen. After her death, he built her Wurttemberg Mausoleum and designed the Schloss Rosenstein. However, his tenure was marked by challenges, including a dispute with a superior that led to his dismissal in 1839, and being held responsible for dry rot discovered

**Classification**: Unexpected

**Raw Response**: Rationale: The critique suggests that Salucci's twenty years as court architect were challenging, which is an evaluative statement about his experience. While the critique does not provide specific details on why it was challenging, it implies that the existing answer should be adjusted to reflect this perspective. The current answer mentions a dispute and being held responsible for dry rot, which can be interpreted as challenges.

#### Non-Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Virgil's relationship with the Zulu amusement park.

**Answer**: Virgil had been born into the ghetto that sprawled behind the zig-zag shadows of Zulu's dilapidated roller coasters. As a very young child, that park represented the promise of magic, adventure and mystery. He'd never had the chance or, later, the inclination to ride a single ride. He had a good job and a respectable house in the suburbs. 

**Critique**: There should be more context instead of just pasting what is in the passage. Zulu's place in Virgil's life evolves over time and the summary show that in full. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the summary should reflect the evolution of Zulu's place in Virgil's life over time. However, it does not provide specific details or guidance on how to achieve this. Without additional information from the source material, it is unclear how Zulu's role in Virgil's life changes beyond what is already mentioned in the answer. Therefore, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the full context of Zulu's evolving significance in Virgil's life.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Daisy's motives in killing Louis?

**Answer**: Louis has probably been abusing Daisy for years, so she looked for an out. Her sudden "clumsiness" was a ploy to get him to hurt her more often. There would be evidence that she was beaten or hurt regularly because of doctor's visits and time spent in the hospital. Daisy likely pretended to "believe" Louis' apologies while planning to kill him. She probably thought that the years of abuse would be enough justification for her to slit his throat. 

**Critique**: The answer makes up claims about Daisy plotting things.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer contains speculative claims about Daisy's plotting, which are not supported by the story. However, it does not provide any specific information or corrections about what Daisy's actual motives are according to the story. Without knowing what the story actually says about Daisy's motives, I cannot improve the answer. The critique identifies an issue but does not guide how to correct it with concrete information.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the narrator?

**Answer**: The narrator can be described as a keen and careful sergeant in the army with a caring family, who sacrifices his wellbeing as well as that of his men for the greater good. He is valiant and resourceful, and he is committed to his men for the time being, commanding their lives in the shells of their rifles. He is conflicted by the fact that he unwillingly leads the men, who stand shoulder by shoulder to the slaughter with camaraderie, pride, fear, and anger. He also admires his foe, the Germans, for their bravery and tenacity. The narrator is also confident that he will not die with the Germans because he is a lucky man. His spirit dwindles as the Germans begin unleashing massive weaponry and his fellows are being killed left and right. In the end, he falls into the water, where he is saved by the British soldiers.

**Critique**: The listing of these emotions does not make sense given context

**Rationale**: The critique states that "the listing of these emotions does not make sense given context," but it does not specify which emotions are incorrect or what the correct emotions should be. Without knowing the specific context or which emotions are appropriate, it is impossible to make a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique does not provide enough information to revise the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the global reaction to Trump's remarks.

**Answer**: Botswana summoned the US ambassador to clarify if they thought of Botswana as a shithole country. Rupert Colville, UN Human Rights spokesperson, said the comments were "shocking and shameful." Haiti's US Ambassador Paul Altidor believes that the remarks Trump made about immigrants who come to the US are wrong.

**Critique**: The answer should include the response of the African Union.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the answer should include the response of the African Union. However, it does not provide any details about what the African Union's response was. Without this information, I cannot improve the answer to include the African Union's response without referring back to the source material. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is the protagonist behaving in such a self-destructive way?

**Answer**: This information can't be found.

**Critique**: The information is not in the story but it can be implied

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer can be improved by inferring the protagonist's behavior from the story, even though it is not explicitly stated. However, without access to the source material, it is impossible to determine what those implications might be. The critique does not provide specific guidance or details that would allow for a concrete improvement to the answer. Therefore, the critique does not enable the editor to write a better answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 6

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize all the information relating to the mountainous Austrian Tyrol.

**Answer**: Averil Demuth's first story was set in the Austrian Tyrol. The girl Trudi, the boy Hansel, the cow Lotti, the dog Berni, the hen Griselda and the raven Kraak all go up the mountain to see Riese the giant, and then all come down again. Eleanor Farjeon gave the book a positive review. The House in the Mountains was also set in the Austrian Tyrol.

**Critique**: The sentence is unnecessary.

**Rationale**: The critique states that "The sentence is unnecessary," but it does not specify which sentence is unnecessary. Since there are multiple sentences in the answer, it is unclear which one should be removed. Without knowing which specific sentence the critique refers to, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 7

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What occupation must the president's lawyer have in today's time?

**Answer**: It must be someone who is well versed in legal matters and can handle the president's case in court.

**Critique**: This isn't an occupation. It would just be better to point out that the question is confusing, as the president's lawyer is already a lawyer.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer does not directly address the question of what specific occupation the president's lawyer must have, as it simply describes the skills or qualifications rather than naming an occupation. However, the critique does not provide an alternative occupation or suggest a specific improvement to the answer. It only mentions that the question is confusing, which does not help in improving the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the context or intent of the question. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 8

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about conservatism?

**Answer**: Conservative students on college campuses are marginalized, threatened, and silenced. Campus Reform is pushing back against this. Progressives would rather threaten you with violence, silence your conservative views, or call for you to be "canceled" from our society if you oppose them. They say your views are dangerous, hateful, fearful, or racist. You can sign your name if you stand for the preservation of free speech, protections for conservative students, and the federal funding to be pulled from colleges and universities when they silence conservative views or students.

**Critique**: The response includes extraneous information not useful for the task.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response includes extraneous information but does not specify which parts are extraneous or what the core information about conservatism should be. Without knowing which specific parts are considered extraneous or what the essential information is, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material. The critique does not provide enough guidance to make a concrete improvement.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 9

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Mike's relationship with Sharon?

**Answer**: Sharon and Mike are friends who are trying to be mates. Sharon shows some enthusiasm when she arrives and Mike invites her to his hotel room for a drink. However, she reacts cautiously at first but still agrees to join him.

**Critique**: This is inaccurate. Sharon never showed enthusiasm anywhere, let alone when she arrived. 

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that Sharon never showed enthusiasm, which directly contradicts the statement in the answer that "Sharon shows some enthusiasm when she arrives." This allows for a concrete improvement by removing or correcting the part about Sharon's enthusiasm. However, the critique does not provide information on what Sharon's actual demeanor was, so while it allows for the removal of the incorrect information, it does not provide enough detail to fully correct the answer without consulting the source material for Sharon's actual behavior. Therefore, while a partial improvement can be made, a complete and accurate revision of the answer is not possible without additional information.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 10

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who is the protagonist of this story?

**Answer**: Stephen Ackerman, a banker for one of the richest banks in Chicago

**Critique**: It is not clear from the text he is a banker

**Rationale**: The critique states that it is not clear from the text that Stephen Ackerman is a banker. However, it does not provide any information or implication about what Stephen Ackerman's actual role or occupation might be. Without additional information or a suggestion of what is correct, I cannot improve the answer to accurately identify the protagonist's role or occupation. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to determine the correct information about Stephen Ackerman's occupation.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 11

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the plot twist in the story.

**Answer**: The story is told as a game being played with Pete, who makes the same mistakes that most people make when they are drawn to good opportunities and then fail to appreciate them. Evidence that Pete is playing the part of past whom are failing to appreciate the opportunities in life comes at the end when Pete has the fourth card with a blank underside. Without knowing it, Pete turned a card over so it was facing down. He then put the fifth card down, which turned out to be a card with a number engraved on the underside. The fifth card, which turned out to be a golden opportunity, ended up being a card made specifically for Pete, which meant that the card Pete held was of the kind that he had the ability to appreciate fully.

**Critique**: This is very confusingly written and seems to be inaccurate. The entire answer should be rewritten.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is confusingly written and seems inaccurate, but it does not provide specific guidance on what is incorrect or how to improve it. Without details on what the plot twist actually is or how the current answer is inaccurate, I cannot rewrite the answer effectively. I would need to refer back to the source material to understand the plot twist and correct the inaccuracies.

#### Non-Constructive Example 12

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about fascism?

**Answer**: Fascists were known for street brawls and disruption to forestall debate. A few students chanted "fascist" when Christina Hoff Sommers spoke at Lewis & Clark law school. Steverson believes yelling fascist is an attempt to intimidate. US News holds that fascism is the practice of using street brawls or violence to maintain power.

**Critique**: Not sure the last sentence is supported

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the last sentence of the answer may not be supported by the source material. However, it does not provide any information on what the correct or supported statement should be. Without additional details or suggestions on how to correct or replace the last sentence, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to verify the accuracy of the statement. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

#### Non-Constructive Example 13

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Qonqurtai's family? 

**Answer**: Qonqurtai was born to Hulagu Khan and Ajuja Aguchi, his Khitan concubine wife. Qonqurtai was Hulagu's ninth son, and also the senior commander during his brother Abaqa's reign as emperor. 

He was married to Toqiyatai Khatun, a Keraite concubine of Hulagu and niece of Dokuz Khatun. She was described as the wise ruler in Zafarnamah.


**Critique**: His wife was not the one described by Zafarnamah

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the description of Qonqurtai's wife as "the wise ruler in Zafarnamah" is incorrect. However, it does not provide the correct information about who is described by Zafarnamah. Without knowing who the correct person is, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to find the accurate information.

#### Non-Constructive Example 14

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about Mark Esper's family?

**Answer**: The family is affected by his being in the position. His son had a violent altercation with his mother in 2011 while they were living in McLean.

**Critique**: There is no answer

**Rationale**: The critique states "There is no answer," which suggests that the provided answer does not accurately reflect the content of the article regarding Mark Esper's family. However, the critique does not provide any specific information or guidance on what the correct information should be. Without additional details or implications from the critique, it is impossible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to determine what the article actually says about Mark Esper's family.

#### Non-Constructive Example 15

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Sharon's character?

**Answer**: Sharon is Mike's friend and they are testing out if they are more than friends. She encounters him at the door and jokes about never having expected him to show up. Sharon appears to be beautiful, knows Mike really well, as they text and he tells her not to expect sex, but she states she is confident and wants to test out the chemistry they both know they have stored up. The friends get to the hotel room only a few minutes after Sharon arrives.

**Critique**: The response is incorrect because the story didn't happen that way at all. Plus, the response doesn't really say anything about Sharon's character because the story is primarily about Mike.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response is incorrect and that the story is primarily about Mike, not Sharon. However, it does not provide any specific information about Sharon's character or how to correct the inaccuracies in the answer. Without additional details or guidance on what aspects of Sharon's character should be highlighted, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

#### Non-Constructive Example 16

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who is the protagonist of this story?

**Answer**: The protagonist of this story is Stephen.

**Critique**: Describe him more.

**Rationale**: The critique asks for a description of the protagonist, Stephen, but does not provide any specific details or characteristics about him. Without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to expand on the description of Stephen. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

#### Non-Constructive Example 17

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the narrator's inability to approach and talk to the girl in the park?

**Answer**: The narrator longs to speak to the girl but hesitates out of fear of rejection. After dreaming of talking to her, the narrator loses sight of her completely and feels emptiness within.

**Critique**: This is an incomplete answer

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is incomplete but does not provide any specific information or guidance on what is missing or how to improve it. Without additional details or implications from the critique, it is impossible to enhance the answer without referring back to the source material to understand what additional information should be included. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What did Mr. Johnson do which caused disaster to fall on the narrator?

**Answer**: Mr. Johnson invited a shady guest into the house and he was overpowered by two of the guest's body guards. The narrator managed to escape with the baby, but got taken by the men in black to the perpetrator's car.

**Critique**: The response inaccurately mentions two body guards overpowering Mr. Johnson.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the mention of "two body guards overpowering Mr. Johnson" is inaccurate. However, it does not provide any information on what actually happened or what should replace this part of the answer. Without knowing the correct details of the event, I cannot improve the answer. I would need to refer back to the source material to understand what truly occurred and how to accurately describe Mr. Johnson's actions and their consequences.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the successes of the Chickasha baseball teams.

**Answer**: They won the 1921 Western Association Championship. The Chickasha Chicks won their second straight championship in 1922. The 1948 Oklahoma State League expansion team, the Chickasha Chiefs, qualified for the playoffs in 1948. They won the 1949 Oklahoma State League championship. The Chickasha Chiefs returned to the Sooner State League playoffs in 1952.

**Critique**: There is no evidence that they won the Oklahoma State League

**Rationale**: The critique states that there is no evidence that they won the Oklahoma State League, which implies that the statement about winning the 1949 Oklahoma State League championship is incorrect. However, the critique does not provide information on what the correct achievements are, if any, regarding the Oklahoma State League. Therefore, without additional information from the source, I cannot determine what the accurate statement should be regarding their successes in the Oklahoma State League. I can only remove the unverified claim, but I cannot replace it with a verified one.

#### Non-Constructive Example 20

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about cyberbullying?

**Answer**: The text does not define cyberbullying. Instead, it simply creates a misdemeanor for "any person" who knowingly engages in repeated cyberbullying of a minor. No specifics are provided.

**Critique**: This response seems to be interpreting the question with respect to the Senate bill, not the article

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is interpreting the question in the context of a Senate bill rather than the article itself. However, it does not provide any specific information or guidance on what the article actually says about cyberbullying. Without knowing what the article states, I cannot improve the answer to accurately reflect the article's content. The critique fails to provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material.

Summarize how the main character's situation changes over the story.

**Answer**: Chad's story begins with him searching through the ship for survivors. He finds the captain, who gives him command of the ship. Chad is in disbelief. He leaves the ship to escape the war.

**Critique**: He doesn't leave the ship.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that directly contradicts a part of the current answer, stating that "He doesn't leave the ship." This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing or correcting the part about Chad leaving the ship. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it gives enough information to make a specific change without needing to refer back to the source material.

#### Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the companies final intentions?

**Answer**: To make changes to IPS that benefits Impact and Puncture; all proc damage calculations will focus on the damage type of the proc being inflicted. Players may focus certain damage type builds to inflict powerful procs, or to go pure damage across different types to inflict multiple procs at once. The company wants  to implement a good idea in an upcoming update.

**Critique**: The first sentence is incomplete. It needs a subject.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the first sentence of the answer is incomplete because it lacks a subject. This is a specific and actionable piece of feedback. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by adding a subject to the first sentence. For example, I could revise it to: "The company plans to make changes to IPS that benefit Impact and Puncture; all proc damage calculations will focus on the damage type of the proc being inflicted." This improvement is based solely on the information provided in the critique.

**Critique**: Replace capital "I" in "servIce". Use the correct spelling for "EquItment".

#### Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe how the narrator's friend felt about her boyfriend. 

**Answer**: For a while, the narrator's friend appeared to love her boyfriend and let him be in charge of everything they did. When she found something that amazed her, however, she became upbeat.

**Critique**: - There is no evidence that the narrator's friend stopped loving her boyfriend at some point.

- There is no hint in the passage of the narrator's friend becoming upbeat on the account of her boyfriend's actions.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific feedback that allows for concrete improvements to the answer. It indicates that there is no evidence that the narrator's friend stopped loving her boyfriend, which implies that the part of the answer suggesting a change in feelings should be removed or revised. Additionally, the critique states that there is no hint of the friend becoming upbeat due to the boyfriend's actions, suggesting that this part of the answer should also be revised or removed. These points allow for a clear path to improving the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

#### Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What can we determine about the voice speaking to Daisy?

**Answer**: The voice says it wants to help Daisy, but soon after the voice says it wants to make her remember what she's done to it. The voice is male and seems to be playing a game with Daisy, he wants Daisy to recall a murder she committed. The voice is that of the man Daisy murdered.

**Critique**: It is omitted that it is the voice of her physically abusive husband. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the voice is that of Daisy's physically abusive husband. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding this detail. The editor can enhance the answer by including the information about the voice belonging to Daisy's abusive husband, which adds context and depth to the understanding of the voice's intentions and relationship with Daisy.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What are the reasons behind the peaceful man's continual visits to the cheerful woman's house?

**Answer**: The man visits the woman's house because he enjoys her company and finds comfort in the repairs she does for him. He also wants to repay her for the kindness she shows him.

**Critique**: The response says that the man finds comforts in the repairs the woman does and wants to repay her kindness, but the man was the one who started repairing her house. The response given would be a proper response to "What are the reasons behind the cheerful woman's continual visits to the peaceful man's house?"

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts the current answer and implies what the correct answer should be. It clarifies that the man is the one doing the repairs, not the woman, and suggests that the roles in the answer are reversed. Therefore, the critique allows us to correct the answer by focusing on the man's actions and motivations for visiting the woman's house, such as enjoying her company and possibly other reasons not related to repairs.

What elements reflect the story's genre?

**Answer**: The story is a speech, which is a genre that is often used to inform or educate.

**Critique**: It is omitted that it is the speech of the President of the United States. It is a science fiction story.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It states that the story is a science fiction story and that it is the speech of the President of the United States. With this information, the answer can be revised to reflect these elements, such as mentioning the science fiction genre and the context of the speech being delivered by the President. This allows for a concrete improvement without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Pierce?

**Answer**: Pierce is a man who is best friends with Josh. He is a killer, but Josh says he wouldn't do such a thing. He is a tall, muscular man with a long black ponytail. He is a bartender at the bar where the girls are. He is a bit rough with Josh and Demie, but he is kind to the girls.

**Critique**: There is nothing from the text to indicate Pierce is tall or muscular. 

**Rationale**: The critique specifically points out that there is no indication in the text that Pierce is tall or muscular. This implies that the description of Pierce being tall and muscular should be removed from the answer. The critique provides enough information to make this specific change without needing to refer back to the source material.

What happens after the stag finds Lucy again?

**Answer**: He looks for her for 3666 days starting from Lucy disappearing and meets the boy, Death. The stag seems to reach a solution to solve the issue of death.

**Critique**: "He looks for her for 3666 days starting from Lucy disappearing and meets the boy, Death. The stag seems to reach a solution to solve the issue of death." - the response is incorrect. It only took the Stag 365 days to find Lucy, not 3666. The boy isn't Death, and the Stag doesn't reach any solutions to solve the issue of death. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections to the current answer, indicating that the Stag took 365 days to find Lucy, not 3666, and clarifying that the boy is not Death and that the Stag does not reach a solution to solve the issue of death. These corrections allow for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

Describe how the narrator's friend felt about her boyfriend. 

**Answer**: The narrator's friend went to great lengths to be with her boyfriend. The narrator says that she too felt extremely jealous when her friend would do anything her boyfriend commanded her to do. She says that her friend soon threw herself into something that would soon take her away from the narrator.

**Critique**: It is incorrect to say that the narrator felt extremely jealous that her friend would do anything her boyfriend commanded her because it's not according to the story. The model needs to eliminate this sentence or rewrite it.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the sentence about the narrator feeling extremely jealous is incorrect and suggests eliminating or rewriting it. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by removing or altering that specific part. The critique does not require additional information from the source material to make this change.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that there is repetition in the answer. Without needing to refer to the source material, I can improve the answer by removing the redundant mention of deportation. The improved answer would be: "He could be deported, sentenced to jail time, or have his contract voided." This addresses the critique by eliminating the repetition and making the answer more concise.

**Answer**: James Butler was ordinary because he had a very ordinary life. He had a wife, two children, and worked an ordinary job. He also had to deal with the death of his wife and daughter in an accident. The death of his wife and daughter changed James Butler's life.

**Critique**: The first two sentences are irrelevant and misleading. 

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the first two sentences are irrelevant and misleading, which implies that they should be removed to improve the answer. This provides clear guidance on how to modify the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. By removing the first two sentences, the focus shifts to the impact of the death of his wife and daughter on James Butler's life, which is likely the key point the critique is highlighting.

The narrator tells Pete to enjoy the rest of his time at the fair and Pete leaves. When the narrator packs up the cards, he notices that the final card has a high number on it. Pete's card has the number 76 written on it.

**Critique**: Only Pete draws a card.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that only Pete draws a card, which implies that the part of the answer stating "they both draw cards from a deck" is incorrect. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing or correcting the part about the narrator drawing a card. The rest of the answer can remain as is, as the critique does not dispute it.

The narrator is helped by a young employee at a pizza place. The narrator is helped by a young man at a pain clinic. The narrator is helped by a young man at the pain clinic.

**Critique**: The narrator being helped by a young man at a pain clinic is repeated.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a specific repetition in the answer, which is that the narrator being helped by a young man at a pain clinic is mentioned twice. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the redundant statement. The critique provides enough information to make this change without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what the text says about referees. 

**Answer**: The text argues that while the referee was correct in issuing a yellow card to Dele Alli for simulation, there is too much focus on minutiae in general, which worries the Tottenham manager. This worry is based on the possibility of changing the game in a way which is undesirable. The text also says that referees are human and sometimes make mistakes, but overall they should remain unmolested and allowed to officiate according to the game rules.

**Critique**: The text also reserves harsh judgement for the use of video technology, holding that human errors are part of the game. Taking this away and replacing it with granular over-analysis will kill the game. Change the final sentence of the response to reflect this.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what needs to be changed in the final sentence of the response. It suggests incorporating the text's harsh judgment on video technology and the importance of human errors in the game. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The editor can modify the final sentence to include the critique's points about video technology and human errors.

**Critique**: The year for the gubernatorial election is inaccurate. This article discusses the New York gubernatorial election for 2018, not 2019.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the correct year of the gubernatorial election, changing it from 2019 to 2018. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the year without needing to refer back to the source material. The rest of the answer remains unchanged, as the critique does not address any other inaccuracies.

#### Constructive Example 19

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the typical turnout for Libertarian candidates and their place in the political lineup. 

**Answer**: There have been few Libertarian candidates running for governor in New York, but those who have run have typically had a visible online following and gained funding from outside the state. The party's typical grassroots support has been low overall though, with no candidates passing the 50,000 mark required for automatic ballot access. With this in mind, third-party candidates for governor typically have little chance to win, though Larry Sharpe believes he could win based on the size of his following and his perceived ability to win debates.

**Critique**: Remove the word "though"

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific instruction to remove the word "though" from the answer. This is a clear and actionable suggestion that can be implemented without needing to refer back to the source material. The removal of the word "though" is a concrete change that can be made directly to improve the clarity or flow of the answer.

**Critique**: The answer should mention the aim of stopping COVID-19.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should include information about the aim of stopping COVID-19 as part of the motivation behind the exercise ban. However, it does not provide specific details or wording on how to incorporate this information into the answer. Without access to the source material, it is unclear how the aim of stopping COVID-19 should be articulated or integrated with the existing information about spreading people's outdoor time more evenly.

### Sample 6/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Discuss the setting of the story.

**Answer**: This story is set in a forest from before time existed until the present day. The forest remained silent for ages until one rainy night, when a raindrop gave birth to the first creature; a small, chubby hand pulled itself out of a pool of rainwater. The creature was drawn to a young girl, who led them both (the creature and the young girl) to find an elusive-yet-endearing creature, the stag. The stag is the only being in the forest, and the source of the physical, natural, and mystical phenomena that exists there. The woods are depicted as being magical and mysterious. The setting provides a distinctly mystical and magical feeling.

**Critique**: Other than being extraneous information, the highlighted text has several inaccuracies, such as the presence of another creature other than the Stag. The entire section should be deleted. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the highlighted text contains inaccuracies and should be deleted. It specifically mentions the presence of another creature besides the stag as inaccurate. Based on this critique, I can improve the answer by removing the section that describes the creature being born from a raindrop and its interaction with the young girl, as this is the part that introduces another creature. The critique provides enough information to make this change without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the phrase "before time" is incomplete and suggests that it should include the word "existed" to make sense. This implies that the phrase should be corrected to "before time existed." With this information, I can improve the answer by modifying the phrase to make it coherent without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Discuss the setting of the story.

**Answer**: The story begins in a place without time, so it could be implied that time and place are one in the same. When time was created, the stag brought death into the world, as life has a beginning and end.

**Critique**: "so it could be implied that time and place are one in the same. When time was created, the stag brought death into the world, as life has a beginning and end." - this is incorrect and not found anywhere in the story. The response is missing the proper setting of the story.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that a significant portion of the answer is incorrect and not found in the story, and it also mentions that the response is missing the proper setting. However, it does not provide any information about what the correct setting is. Without knowing what the proper setting should be, I cannot improve the answer.

The setting of the rainforest is important to the plot, as the characters must navigate its terrain. The settings is mysterious and dangerous, with many unanswered questions. The rainforest becomes a place to explore where there are possibilities and danger.

**Critique**: "The rains awaken a young girl and the Stag, who is a white stag. The stag protects the girl and eventually turns her into a deer with white fur.

**Critique**: The question is what happens between the Stag and Lucy, not the Stag and the Boy. The entire response is incorrect.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer does not address the question, which is about the interaction between Lucy and the Stag, not the Stag and the boy.

**Critique**: "The Stag becomes close with a human boy and shows him his abilities as the sky." - the boy is irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the part about "the Stag becomes close with a human boy and shows him his abilities as the sky" is irrelevant. This implies that this sentence should be removed from the answer. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by eliminating the irrelevant detail about the boy, thus making the critique constructive.

It only took the Stag 365 days to find Lucy, not 3666. The boy isn't Death, and the Stag doesn't reach any solutions to solve the issue of death. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections to the current answer, indicating that the Stag took 365 days to find Lucy, not 3666, and clarifying that the boy is not Death and that the Stag does not reach a solution to solve the issue of death.

The stag allows the boy to spend time with him, and eventually covers himself in leaves so that the boy is not scared. The stag eventually buries Lucy, and returns to the forest with the boy.

**Critique**: "When the stag finds Lucy again, he realizes that she has transformed into a doe of flesh and bone." - this is inaccurate. The Stag knew what befell Lucy even before he found her again. When he found her 365 years later, she was already dead.

What does the text say about the White House Correspondents' Association dinner?

**Answer**: No answer

**Critique**: It is omitted that journalists whined about comedian Michelle Wolf who appeared at the dinner and roasted folks during her remarks.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what was omitted from the answer, namely that journalists complained about comedian Michelle Wolf's performance at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner.

### Sample 22/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the White House Correspondents' Association dinner?

**Answer**: Michelle Wolf, a comedienne and member of the White House Correspondents' Association, is invited to perform at the association's annual dinner. The 2018 dinner coincided with, among other things, a government shutdown threat by President Trump. Michelle performed her routine that offended the sensibilities of many of the most powerful members of the media who were present. The president and his cabal remained willfully ignorant of Michelle's satirical comedy, choosing to focus instead on who the president might have dated in the past (#11). This is ironic because Trump's cabinet (or those working with him) officially promoted others ahead of more qualified applicants. Tiger Beat Defense isn't working very well against their critics, but the president and his cabal did:

**Critique**: It is not mentioned that it was 2018. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the year 2018 is not mentioned in the answer. However, the answer already includes the information that the 2018 dinner coincided with a government shutdown threat by President Trump. Therefore, the critique does not provide new information or a specific action to improve the answer. Since the critique does not suggest any additional changes or corrections beyond what is already present, it does not enable a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the White House Correspondents' Association dinner?

**Answer**: The White House Correspondents' Association dinner is being used as an excuse by most journalists to focus on a comedic routine instead of focusing on more important news items, such as the president's border wall proposal and violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution. The comedic routine is seen as offensive by many members of the media.

**Critique**: It is omitted that Wolf says the media to be obsessed with Trump and that the media pretend to hate him but secretly love him since he's helped them sell their papers, books, and TV.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be added to the current answer. It mentions that Wolf accuses the media of being obsessed with Trump and pretending to hate him while secretly loving him because he helps them sell their products. This information can be directly incorporated into the answer to provide a more comprehensive view of what the text says about the White House Correspondents' Association dinner. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what CBS chariman, Les Moonves, said at a 2016 media conference.

**Answer**: It may seem good for CBS, but it is not good for the country. It is a good thing to have Donald Trump lead the nation.

**Critique**: It is not clear that 'it' refers to Donald Trump's presence in the 2016 election 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the pronoun "it" is ambiguous and does not clearly refer to Donald Trump's presence in the 2016 election. To improve the answer, I can replace "it" with a more specific reference to Donald Trump's presence in the election, making the statement clearer. This can be done without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides enough information to make this specific change.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what CBS chariman, Les Moonves, said at a 2016 media conference.

**Answer**: Les Moonves says that Donald Trump's presence in politics is great for CBS, that Trump has helped CBS sell water and college alike. What Les Moonves points out is ironically very problematic and offensive to the truth, because it glosses over the reality that Trump wasn't selling water and college, but presidential office

**Critique**: It is unclear and irrelevant that Trump has helped CBS sell water and college alike. What Les Moonves points out is ironically very problematic and offensive to the truth, because it glosses over the reality that Trump wasn't selling water and college, but presidential office.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about Trump helping CBS sell "water and college alike" is unclear and irrelevant. It also highlights that the statement about Moonves glossing over the reality of Trump selling the presidential office is problematic and offensive. However, the critique does not provide specific information on what Moonves actually said at the conference, nor does it suggest how to correct or improve the answer. Without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to rewrite the answer accurately.

**Critique**: It is omitted that his thoughts about separation reverted when his wife calls him and says she is making his favorite dinner. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about Gary's feelings that were omitted from the original answer. It mentions that Gary's thoughts about separation change when his wife calls him to say she is making his favorite dinner.

What does the text say about Roller's stage design work?

**Answer**: The text indicates that Roller was a stage designer and was commissioned specifically to design costumes for Tannhäuser at the 1942 Festival in Bayreuth. He was also commissioned to design sets for Richard Strauss' opera, "Friedenstag," though he was killed before the work was completed.

**Critique**: He died after 1940

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts the timeline mentioned in the answer. It states that Roller died after 1940, which implies that the statement about him being killed before completing the work for "Friedenstag" might be incorrect. However, the critique does not provide enough information to correct the entire answer or to confirm what is accurate about his stage design work. Without additional details, such as the correct timeline or what he completed, the answer cannot be fully improved.

**Answer**: Roller's last set of Wieland's designs was for the project of a new play at the municipal theatre in Bayreuth, the Tannhäuser. It is not stated when it will be premiered. In this play, he was to work with Hamburg. It is presumable that the production was canceled. The play never reached its full season because of Ulrich's death, which also led to the canceling of Daphne and Daphne's second part.

**Critique**: This is an encyclopedia not an advert

**Rationale**: The critique "This is an encyclopedia not an advert" does not provide specific information or guidance on how to improve the answer. It suggests a tone or style issue, implying that the answer may be too promotional or not objective enough for an encyclopedia entry. However, without specific details on what parts of the answer are problematic or how to adjust the tone, it is not possible to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Critique**: The answer could mention the incompatibilities.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should include information about incompatibilities related to the SR-25, AR-10, or LR-308 Pattern Magazine. However, it does not specify what those incompatibilities are. Without knowing the specific details of these incompatibilities, I cannot improve the answer. I would need to refer back to the source material to identify and describe the incompatibilities accurately.

### Sample 31/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about one of the issues with the SR-25 pattern?

**Answer**: Not all AR-308 rifles use magazines that are compatible with the SR-25 pattern. For instance, the HK417, MR308, and MR762 all use a proprietary design. Armalite switched from their original pattern magazines to modified M14 magazines in 1996 with their new AR-10B model. However, they reintroduced their original SR-25 pattern magazine design with the AR-10A model in 2012. 

**Critique**: The second and third sentences are irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the second and third sentences are irrelevant. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by removing those sentences. The remaining content will focus on the issue with the SR-25 pattern, which is the compatibility of magazines with AR-308 rifles. Therefore, the critique allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: The final sentence is not relevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the final sentence is not relevant, which implies that it should be removed from the answer. This provides a clear and actionable step to improve the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. By removing the final sentence, the answer will focus solely on the incompatibility aspect, as required by the question.

### Sample 33/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Sdružení československých horníků?

**Answer**: Sdružení československých horníků (Czechoslovak Miners Association) was a Syndicalist mine workers trade union in Czechoslovakia. The union had its roots in the Free Association of Miners and Ironworkers of Austria. SČH was founded in Northern Bohemia by anarchists and revolutionary socialists. The union revived the journal Hornické Listy, which had been the organ of the Free Association of Miners and Ironworkers of Austria, as its organ. The union was not affiliated to any trade union center.

**Critique**: It should be mentioned that after 1923, the SCH was gradually weakened as members of the union joined the communist-led Red Trade Unions.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the current answer to improve it. It mentions that after 1923, the Sdružení československých horníků (SCH) was gradually weakened as members joined the communist-led Red Trade Unions. This information can be incorporated into the existing answer to provide a more complete picture of the union's history and challenges.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the miners' strike of 1919?

**Answer**: The SČH organized a miner's strike on November 25, 1919, which was repressed by police and army. Many miners were arrested, and when the revolutionary syndicalists of SČH had operated more or less independently, the union was tied closer to the Czechoslovak Socialist Party as it faced police repression. The workers of SČH were attacked by police forces. They declared a socialist council republic.

**Critique**: These last two sentences have to do with the 1920 workers strike and should be omitted.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the last two sentences of the answer pertain to a different event (the 1920 workers strike) and should be omitted. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by removing the irrelevant information. Therefore, I can improve the answer by omitting the last two sentences, which are not related to the miners' strike of 1919.

**Critique**: Trump refers to Nike's new ad as "terrible"

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It clarifies that the term "terrible" was used by Trump in reference to Nike's new ad, not directly to Kaepernick. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by specifying what Trump described as "terrible."

Others think he should not be kneeling before the anthem. Some people are labeling him as anti-American since he is protesting racial injustice and police brutality.

**Critique**: The article never uses the term "anti-American" and the last sentence is unsupported

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the term "anti-American" is not used in the article and that the last sentence is unsupported.

While it's clear this friend is drifting further away, the narrator clearly cares deeply for her. The narrator feels hopeless and impatient, wanting her friend to recognize she needs help. She feels a sense of nostalgia and connection to the friend while also seeing how different they've become. The narrator knows this is likely the beginning of a long journey ahead in maintaining their relationship but still hope the friend can ultimately be reached and healed.

**Critique**: The last line of the answer contains a grammatical error that should be corrected.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue in the answer—the presence of a grammatical error in the last line.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the feelings the narrator has toward her friend. 

**Answer**: The narrator is worried about her friend. The narrator feels more aloof from her friend than ever and seems to ping pong between being annoyed with her to being upset at her. The narrator also was jealous of her friend at one point. The narrator felt very sad to see her friend everyday and feel like she barely knew her. 

**Critique**: '...seems to ping pong between being annoyed with her to being upset at her.' This statement means the same thing, though it appears the model meant otherwise. The model needs to rewrite this statement for better clarity.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the phrase "ping pong between being annoyed with her to being upset at her" is redundant because being annoyed and being upset are essentially the same. The critique suggests that the model intended to convey a different meaning, implying that the statement should be rewritten for clarity. However, the critique does not provide specific guidance on what the intended meaning might be or how to rewrite the statement. Without additional information or context from the source material, it is not possible to determine what the correct or intended meaning should be. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without consulting the source material.

Summarize the feelings the narrator has toward her friend. 

**Answer**: The narrator mostly enjoyed spending time and hanging out with her. She referred to herself as busy and is comfortable with the arrangement. At times there is a sense of loss due to, in her words, her friend choosing another lifestyle. That specific description is exemplified a moment when running into her and her boy, the narrator later regretted not being invited on the date.

**Critique**: The story never indicated that the narrator referred to herself as busy and was comfortable with such arrangement. Also, the story does not mention that the narrator regretted declining a date with Audrey and her boyfriend. These sentences are highly inaccurate. The model needs to highlight valid points from the story to answer the question adequately.

**Rationale**: The critique points out inaccuracies in the current answer but does not provide specific information on what the narrator's feelings actually are. It mentions that certain statements are incorrect but does not offer any correct information or implications about the narrator's feelings. Therefore, without access to the source material, it is impossible to improve the answer based solely on the critique provided.

### Sample 43/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the feelings the narrator has toward her friend. 

**Answer**: It's most clear that the narrator felt discouraged and sad that her friend could not find any answers or confidence in herself. She wondered why her friend would let herself be pushed out of the group. This led her to look down on her friend, which made her feel bad. She wanted to help her friend, but she also felt her friend cannot accept her support at times. 

It's certainly clear that the narrator and her friend had a very heartbreaking friendship.

**Critique**: The story does not mention that the narrator looked down on her friend. The model should either eliminate this statement or include something more accurate. It also says that she allowed herself to be pushed out of the group. It is uncertain where the model got this information from, but it needs to be rewritten or erased altogether.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on what parts of the answer are inaccurate and need to be changed. It indicates that the statement about the narrator looking down on her friend should be removed or replaced with something accurate, and the part about the friend being pushed out of the group should be rewritten or erased. This allows for concrete improvements to be made to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: 'The narrator's friend knew that this boy would take her away....' is inaccurate and changes the meaning of that aspect of the story. The sentence should be rewritten more accurately.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific part of the answer as inaccurate and suggests that it changes the meaning of the story. However, it does not provide any information on what the accurate version should be. Without knowing what the correct information is, I cannot rewrite the sentence accurately. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to understand what the correct information is and how to rewrite the sentence.

**Rationale**: The critique states that half of the answer is inaccurate but does not specify which half or provide any details about what is accurate.

The narrator says that she too felt extremely jealous when her friend would do anything her boyfriend commanded her to do. She says that her friend soon threw herself into something that would soon take her away from the narrator.

**Critique**: It is incorrect to say that the narrator felt extremely jealous that her friend would do anything her boyfriend commanded her because it's not according to the story. The model needs to eliminate this sentence or rewrite it.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the sentence about the narrator feeling extremely jealous is incorrect and suggests eliminating or rewriting it.

She was caught in a cycle where she gave her self away to whoever would give her the most attention, but the attention would never satisfy her.

**Critique**: The last line of the answer has nothing to do with how the narrator's friend felt about her boyfriend. Therefore, this sentence should be erased.

**Rationale**: The critique specifically points out that the last line of the answer is irrelevant to the question about how the narrator's friend felt about her boyfriend.

### Sample 68/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about damage types?

**Answer**: There are three damage types in Warframe that have become the forefront of modding and weapon diversity: Impact, Puncture, and Slash. Damage is split into 8 categories, four elemental damage types, and four more combining two elemental types, with one of them being special. Damage also has a benefit (called status effects) that can be applied procedurally by chance, usually known as procs.

**Critique**: There are 10 elemental damage types, not eight categories. The ten include four base elements (cold, electricity, heat, and toxin) and the six combinations formed by modding two elements.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the correct number of elemental damage types and their composition. It states that there are 10 elemental damage types, including four base elements and six combinations.

### Sample 69/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about damage types?

**Answer**: Since the Damage 2.0 update, the developer made changes that brought physical damage types and ten elemental damage types in Arsenals for modding, making it possible for modders and players to understand what stats are given bonuses or even bonuses. The damage types are broken down into three types, which are Impact, Puncture, and Slash, which each have their own attack style. Impact procs cause enemies to stagger, Puncture proc reduce the enemy’s damage output by 30%, and Slash products inflict “bleed” damage over time. Damage proc also scales  in effectiveness, but only from 10% to 75%.

**Critique**: Damage 2.0  wasn't made to make it possible for players to understand what stats are given bonuses. This isn't said in the text. It's said that it was meant to bring the damage types to the forefront of Arsenals for modding and weapon diversity.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the purpose of the Damage 2.0 update, stating that it was meant to bring damage types to the forefront of Arsenals for modding and weapon diversity, rather than making it possible for players to understand what stats are given bonuses. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the stated purpose of the update.

### Sample 73/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the process of leveling the field? 

**Answer**: The text discusses a change to how Physical damage types are calculated, making Impact and Puncture powers scale in effectiveness based on the damage dealt. This increases the usefulness of Impact and Puncture powers for quicker frame's and weapons that deal large damage amounts all at once.

**Critique**: The text doesn't necessarily say that the update would increase usefulness of weapons, but says that it would favor weapons that deal large amounts of damage. Additionally, there is no mention of quicker frames, so both these points should be omitted.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on what aspects of the answer are incorrect and need to be omitted. It clarifies that the text does not mention an increase in the usefulness of weapons or quicker frames, but rather that it favors weapons dealing large amounts of damage. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the incorrect points about usefulness and quicker frames, and focusing on the favoring of high-damage weapons.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 74/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the process of leveling the field? 

**Answer**: The process of leveling the field involves making changes to the physical damage types. These changes include- improving the effectiveness of the Impact and Puncture procs, scaling these procs based on the damage dealt and changing the way the proc's associated damage output is calculated.To help visualize these changes, the author has used a new Warframe (Khora) as an example and has also given an example of every time a weapon is at disposal.

**Critique**: Mentioning a visualization without describing the visualization doesn't necessarily explain the process of leveling the field. It would be better to say that a small damage output would cause smaller damage, while a damage proc with high damage output could possibly immobilize someone.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information on how to improve the answer by suggesting a more detailed explanation of the process of leveling the field. It implies that the answer should include an explanation of how different levels of damage output affect the outcome, such as smaller damage causing smaller effects and higher damage potentially immobilizing someone. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 75/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the process of leveling the field? 

**Answer**: The complicated math involved in leveling out the field is not described as clearly as it could be. Finishing the leveling process will require fiddling with other processes to change things up. At the time of the article being written, the process was described as not ready for release. A new Dev Workshop was scheduled to air in 2018. Besides, the changes to levels of the fields would broaden players' options, allowing them to choose whichever kind of reaction fits best.

**Critique**: This answer doesn't really describe the process of leveling the field. This reads like more of a critique of the process than the process that is explained.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer does not actually describe the process of leveling the field, but rather critiques it. However, it does not provide any specific information or guidance on what the process actually entails. Without additional details or specific corrections, I cannot improve the answer to accurately describe the process of leveling the field. I would need to refer back to the source material to understand what the process involves.

**Answer**: The text says that Impact and Puncture procs will now scale in effectiveness based on the damage dealt. Status effects associated with Slash will continue to stack multiple procs on top of one another.

**Critique**: This is a description of a different style of proc, so it would be better to omit this.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the current answer describes a different style of proc and implies that the information about Impact, Puncture, and Slash procs is not relevant to the question about damage-scaling procs. Therefore, the critique implies that the irrelevant information should be omitted. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the unrelated details, even though it doesn't specify what should be included instead.

### Sample 77/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about damage-scaling procs?

**Answer**: Additional status effects will not "reproc." The new damage-scaling procs would favor weapons that can output large damage amounts all at once. The upgraded proc will be made up of the damage total from the original and the proc added together. 

**Critique**: It's omitted that Impact and Puncture procs will now scale in effectiveness based on the damage dealt, which means a small damage output would cause smaller damage, while a damage proc with high damage output could possibly immobilize someone. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about how Impact and Puncture procs will now scale in effectiveness based on the damage dealt. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding this detail. The critique implies that the effectiveness of these procs is directly related to the damage output, which is a specific and actionable piece of information that can be included in the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 78/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about damage-scaling procs?

**Answer**: The author is discussing that the damage-scaling procs that the physical damage types of impact and puncture will scale in effectiveness, based on the damage dealt. This means that the power of the procs will depend on the damage that caused the proc. For example: if the damage dealt by an assault rifle to an enemy is low (1 shot impact proc), then the proc will only cause a short stagger, but maintaining high damage amount would cause the stun to last longer (This can also be compared to a shield).

**Critique**: It's omitted that there is a flaw in this damage-scaling proc change and that they've made a systemic change to fix this. The damage scaling would favor weapons that can output large damage amounts all at once, but they've  decided to additively increase the effectiveness of the existing proc to fix this. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about a flaw in the damage-scaling proc change and mentions a systemic change made to address this flaw. It states that the damage scaling initially favored weapons with high damage output, but a change was made to additively increase the effectiveness of the existing proc. This information allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by including the flaw and the corrective measure taken, without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: This is a description of a different style of proc, so it would be better to omit this.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the current answer describes a different style of proc than what is relevant to the question. However, it does not provide any information about what the correct style of proc should be or what the text actually says about damage-scaling procs.

There are going to be some changes to IPS status types, and more specifically the new rules of awarding proced based on damage output. The aim is to make a system more interesting and make dual damage types appealing. There is a theoretical datamining that this might influence enemy lethality, viability of using weapons, reloading times and fatigue management.

**Critique**: While these are mostly goals of the company, they're not necessarily the laid out final intentions. The final intentions are a bit different than laying out the changes. These sentences should be omit this.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer does not accurately reflect the final intentions of the company, as it focuses on goals rather than final intentions. However, the critique does not provide specific information about what the final intentions are, nor does it suggest what should replace the current content.

**Critique**: The interaction of the narrator and the postman is conveyed confusingly.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the interaction between the narrator and the postman is confusing, but it does not provide specific guidance on how to clarify or improve this part of the answer.

### Sample 97/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what happened to Alexa, and why she sent the narrator the packages.

**Answer**: Alexa was trying to tell the narrator that before she died, she would send him packages with everything she loved of him to cheer him up. She was trying to tell him how she loved him. However, the narrator accidentally thought that Alexa was a boy, sending him a letter to get him excited, because of the name his mother had said sounded like a boy's name. 

**Critique**: There's nothing about the narrator thinking Alexa was a boy.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the part about the narrator thinking Alexa was a boy is incorrect. This implies that the sentence or part of the sentence mentioning this should be removed or corrected. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement by removing the inaccurate detail about the narrator's misconception regarding Alexa's gender.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what happened to Alexa, and why she sent the narrator the packages.

**Answer**: The narrator was sent a package with a letter from Alexa, an old friend. The package contained a box with a photobook, novels, and a diary. The narrator was confused and upset, and the letter from Alexa explained that she was sick and wanted to be forgotten. The narrator was upset and didn't want to open the diary. The narrator decided to keep the diary untouched.

**Critique**: The narrator wasn't upset to learn that Alexa wanted to say goodbye. Additionally, Alexa says to let her go, not that she wanted to be forgotten.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections to the current answer. It clarifies that the narrator was not upset about Alexa wanting to say goodbye and corrects the statement about Alexa's intentions, indicating that she wanted to be let go rather than forgotten. These corrections allow for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The revised answer can reflect these changes by stating that the narrator was not upset about Alexa's goodbye and that Alexa wanted to be let go.

### Sample 100/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what happened to Alexa, and why she sent the narrator the packages.

**Answer**: Two packages were sent to the narrator. The first was a letter from Alexa and a box that was wrapped in plain paper. 
The box's contents were faded memories of their childhood, and underneath it was the narrator's own diary. In this, the narrator would learn that Alexa had cancer and she was trying to tell the narrator that she loved him so that he would be able to move on, even after she passed away. Conversely, that Alexa was probably also trying to induce jealousy in the narrator-if he truly loved her as she claimed, why wouldn't he have met with her?

**Critique**: The contents and the commentary about jealousy are made up. It'd be better if the answer was scrapped.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the information about the contents of the packages and the commentary on jealousy are fabricated. However, it does not provide any specific details or corrections about what actually happened to Alexa or why she sent the packages. Without knowing the true contents of the packages or the actual reason Alexa sent them, I cannot improve the answer. The critique suggests scrapping the answer, but it does not offer any guidance on what the correct information should be, making it impossible to rewrite the answer without consulting the source material.

### Sample 101/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what happened to Alexa, and why she sent the narrator the packages.

**Answer**: The narrator has woken up after a sweet dream. He kisses his father, takes his camera with him on his way, and goes to school. When he comes back home, he finds a man on the door delivering packages. He decides to open one and finds memories of his childhood friend, a box, and a letter. He's shocked that she sent him her diary, but realizes the letter is for him to read first. She tells him about her journey battling cancer, the flashes of messages that he inspired, and how she loves him. The narrator realizes how fleeting life is, and how life might have been different if he were her or she were him.

**Critique**: The narrator's day before he gets the box is fake.

**Rationale**: The critique states that "The narrator's day before he gets the box is fake," which implies that the details about the narrator's activities before receiving the packages are incorrect or irrelevant. However, the critique does not provide any specific information about what actually happened or what should replace the current description of the narrator's day. Without additional details or guidance on what is accurate, it is not possible to improve the answer solely based on the critique. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material.

### Sample 102/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about sleep paralysis in children?

**Answer**: Sleep paralysis is when a person is in a state of sleep paralysis and can't break free from being held or touched in any way from a monster. The narrator says that children are the hardest to save because their imaginations are a lot wilder and they don't understand how one minute they can be hugging their parents and the next minute an unknown figure is holding them tight crushing them. They are too weak and confused and just before they draw a last breath they are in a sleep paralysis. The narrator says that children need to understand that the bedroom is the safest place so they don't have a sanctuary yet and the monster is already on top of them choking them before they can wake them.

**Critique**: Rephrase the last sentence for clarity - they don't have a sanctuary BECAUSE they don't see the bedroom as safe.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the clarity of the last sentence by suggesting a rephrasing that emphasizes the causal relationship between not seeing the bedroom as safe and not having a sanctuary. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

The organization served as an information exchange among the secret police forces of a number of German-speaking countries. The union was dissolved in 1866 with the outbreak of the Seven Weeks' War between the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia.

**Critique**: The union's dissolution is irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the information about the union's dissolution is irrelevant. This implies that the part of the answer discussing the dissolution should be removed. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by omitting the irrelevant detail about the dissolution, focusing only on the formation and purpose of the union.

### Sample 104/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything relating to Jonathan Demme's filmography.

**Answer**: Demme offered to direct a live performance video for a song by Robyn Hitchcock. The director was inspired by a Hungarian theater group. Demme cast Hitchcock in small roles in two other films, The Manchurian Candidate and Rachel Getting Married, and used one of his songs in The Truth About Charlie.

**Critique**: The response is incorrect and doesn't summarize everything related to Demme's filmography, which should include the movies mentioned in the text such as The Manchurian Candidate, Rachel Getting Married, The Truth About Charlie, Melvin And Howard, Married to The Mob, and Storefront Hitchcock. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about additional films that should be included in the summary of Jonathan Demme's filmography. It lists the movies "Melvin And Howard," "Married to The Mob," and "Storefront Hitchcock," which are not mentioned in the original answer. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding these films to the summary without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: He's a folk-rocker and his songs are the real attraction in the concert film. The songs are a good overview of his large personal catalog.

**Critique**: Add that he's a "quirky" folk-rocker.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information to add to the current answer, namely that Hitchcock is a "quirky" folk-rocker. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by incorporating the descriptor "quirky" into the existing description of Hitchcock as a musician. The editor does not need to refer back to the source material to make this addition, as the critique directly supplies the necessary detail.

**Critique**: It's omitted that he wants to escape the memories that haunt him. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the current answer to improve it. It states that Maximillian Garvey also wants to escape the memories that haunt him, which is a concrete detail that can be included without needing to refer back to the source material. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it allows for a clear improvement to the answer by adding this additional motivation.

**Answer**: Maximillian Garvey is charged with treason by the King and sentenced to death. His wife and son are killed before he can even process what is happening. He is then separated from his son, who is taken by the King's elite guards to insure his future good behavior.

**Critique**: The son is not killed. He's taken away.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that directly contradicts a part of the current answer. It states that the son is not killed but is instead taken away. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the misinformation about the son's fate. The editor can revise the answer to reflect that the son is taken away by the King's elite guards, rather than being killed, without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: The king is a mad monarch who employs the Reaper's Hand. The Reaper's Hand are killing squads that are rictus grins showing behind their masks. They killed Jazira, Maximillian's wife, and kidnapped his son to insure his future good behavior.

**Critique**: The squad aren't "rictus grins", they have them. It would just be better to omit this detail. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by suggesting the removal of a particular detail that is incorrect. It clarifies that the squad members have "rictus grins" rather than being "rictus grins" themselves. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by omitting the incorrect detail about the squad's appearance. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it enables a specific revision without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: The answer could also touch on some of the organizations he helped found.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should include information about organizations that Asaddor Ali helped found. However, it does not specify which organizations these are.

It may be that they are making claims that are incorrect or misleading, such as the quality, history, or performance characteristics of a product, or that they are giving false information about the availability of repair facilities or spare parts. Businesses also sometimes make false claims about the price of a product, value, or quality of goods and services. It can be misleading when a business uses a picture of aeroplanes to give the impression that it takes freight by air, when in reality it takes freight by road.

**Critique**: Clumsy sentence structure

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the sentence structure is clumsy, but it does not provide specific guidance on how to improve it. Without specific suggestions or examples of how to restructure the sentences, it is not possible to make a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique does not imply any specific changes or corrections that can be made without referring back to the source material for clarification on how to improve the sentence structure.

### Sample 113/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What are some questionable tactics in business advertising that are still legal?

**Answer**: Some advertisements may compare products or services to others on the market. Comparative advertising can be misleading if the comparison is inaccurate or does not appropriately compare products. Bait advertising takes place when an advertisement promotes certain (usually ‘sale’) prices on products that are not available or available only in very limited quantities. Puffery is also a legal tactic.

**Critique**: Only puffery is a legal tactic.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that only puffery is a legal tactic, implying that the other tactics mentioned (comparative advertising and bait advertising) are not legal. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the mention of comparative advertising and bait advertising as legal tactics. The revised answer would focus solely on puffery as a legal tactic in business advertising.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How was the game, Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter, received by the players?

**Answer**: Before the launch of the game, it received a lot of positive feedback in their reviews. This is why the developers made many edits to the game to make sure that it is of the highest quality. After the launch, the game received mostly positive reviews. From a total of 7,351 reviews, 5,730 reviews are positive.

**Critique**: There's no mention of reviews before launch or the developers making edits in the article.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the information about reviews before the launch and developers making edits is not mentioned in the article. This implies that these parts of the answer are incorrect or irrelevant. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing these parts and focusing on the post-launch reception, which is supported by the data provided in the answer (5,730 out of 7,351 reviews are positive).

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what is incorrect in the answer, namely the description of Pierce as "tall and muscular." It instructs to remove this part of the description. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the incorrect details about Pierce's physical appearance without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: The highlighted text is incorrect. Rachel was only curious about Pierce. She was also not afraid of him. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about Rachel's curiosity and lack of fear, but it only addresses her interaction with Pierce, not the two other men. The critique corrects the part about Rachel being curious about the two other men and not being afraid of them, but it does not provide enough information to fully correct the answer regarding her interactions with the other men. Therefore, while it allows for partial improvement, it does not provide enough information to fully improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about damage types?

**Answer**: Since Damage 2.0, physical damage come in three types (Impact, Puncture, and Slash) that have been brought to the forefront of Arsenals for modding and weapon diversity. Each damage type is stronger or weaker against specific enemy types. Puncture procs reduce the enemy's damage output by a flat 30%, and Slash procs inflict damage over time. Slash has long been considered the most powerful of these effects.

**Critique**: The answer should mention the elemental damage types.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer is missing information about elemental damage types. However, it does not specify what those elemental damage types are. Without knowing the specific elemental damage types, I cannot improve the answer to include them. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to identify and include the correct elemental damage types.

### Sample 122/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about damage-scaling procs?

**Answer**: In an update coming soon, the developers will be making changes to IPS status effects and proc damage calculation. The primary goal is to improve Impact and Puncture. Both of these procs will now scale in effectiveness, based on the damage dealt. An Impact proc with a small damage output will still only cause a short stagger, while an Impact proc with high damage output can scale all the way up to a ragdoll. Puncture procs will now scale in effectiveness from 10% to 75% damage reduction, based on the damage dealt at the time of proc. Slash will continue working as it does now, stacking multiple status effects on top of one another.

**Critique**: The last line is not relevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the last line of the answer is not relevant. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by removing the last line about Slash, which is not related to the question about damage-scaling procs.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the companies final intentions?

**Answer**: The companies final intentions are to make a more interesting systemic change. They want to approach all feedback with the understanding that from their end, their goal is a more interesting systemic change. They also want to make edge case things that feel like massive nerfs into civil feedback, in order to address them.

**Critique**: The last line is incorrect--they are asking for civil feedback as a request.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the last line of the answer is incorrect and clarifies that the companies are asking for civil feedback as a request, rather than making edge case things feel like massive nerfs. This provides enough information to correct the last line of the answer by changing it to reflect that the companies are requesting civil feedback. Therefore, the critique allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

The falsifications were designed to under-report rent-regulated tenants living in Kushner Cos. properties. This is a safeguard put in place to protect tenants from steep rental increases and displacement.

Shortly after a lawsuit was filed against Kushner Cos., Gov. Andrew Cuomo launched an investigation into the business practices of the company.

**Critique**: Cuomo's lawsuit is irrelevant to the answer.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the mention of Cuomo's lawsuit is irrelevant to the answer.

Eventually the Department of Buildings was able to scratch down 42 violations at 12 addresses between January 2013 and September 2016 under Kushner's direction

**Critique**: The New York City Department of Buildings is never mentioned to have received complaints - they found the misreporting of rent-controlled tenants in an investigation.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts the current answer and implies a correction. It states that the New York City Department of Buildings did not receive complaints but instead found the misreporting of rent-controlled tenants through an investigation. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the part about receiving complaints and instead mentioning the investigation and the discovery of misreporting.

### Sample 141/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the role of the New York City Department of Buildings in the news.

**Answer**: The New York City Department of Buildings regulates construction building permits and enforces violations of falsifying these permits. The City Department penalized Kushner Cos. $210,000 after investigating allegations that the company had falsified construction applications at 17 sites. The allegations occurred while Jared Kushner was CEO of Kushner Cos. and this Department is currently investigating their business practices.

**Critique**: It's wrong and confusing to say the NYC Department of Buildings "enforces violations of falsifying" since they punish violations.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a specific issue with the phrasing "enforces violations of falsifying," suggesting that it is incorrect and confusing. The critique implies that the correct action is to change the wording to reflect that the NYC Department of Buildings punishes or penalizes violations, rather than enforcing them. This provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by rephrasing that part to accurately describe the Department's role in penalizing violations.

### Sample 142/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the role of the New York City Department of Buildings in the news.

**Answer**: Falsifying construction building permits is a violation, and the New York City Department of Buildings investigated a number of firms and reported on them, one of them notably being Kushner Cos, where the violations went on from January 2013 to September 2016. There have been several violations across seventeen sites, where people reporting issues have been the builders themselves, although reasons for the violations are unclear. Actions taken by the Department are fines amounting to $210,000. The city is protective of rent-controlled tenants and want to safeguard them against being exposed to steep rental increases or being put on the street to make way for higher-paying tenants. Subsequently, the Department conducts an investigation into Kushner Cos, suspecting they have likely falsified paperwork to get things they want.

**Critique**: The article doesn't mention several firms being investigated.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the article does not mention several firms being investigated, which implies that the statement in the answer about "a number of firms" being investigated is incorrect. However, the critique does not provide specific information about what is correct or what should replace the incorrect statement. Without knowing what the article actually says, I cannot determine the accurate information to include in the answer.

Summarize the lesson the narrator learns.

**Answer**: The narrator learns that he needs to get regular dental cleaning because life's going to always find a way to make a mess. He learned that as a human, we're prone to ingesting bacteria, dirt, and blood, etc. and despite the stigma that dentistry is something you may dread or fear, once you do it, you realize it's not as bad as it seems.

**Critique**: The second half of the sentence doesn't make much sense.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the second half of the sentence in the answer is unclear or confusing. This implies that the sentence should be revised or removed to improve clarity. However, the critique does not provide specific guidance on how to rewrite or clarify the sentence, nor does it suggest what the correct or intended meaning might be. Without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to determine how to accurately revise the sentence to convey the intended lesson.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about internet research?

**Answer**: The narrator mentions going to the Internet to learn about dentistry to fill any gaps in what she thought she knew. Her search yields a few videos with very graphic depictions of bone-melting acids and medical grade epoxies, which terrify her. The narrator learns a lot about dental hygiene and even becomes "an exhibit" in which the students get to see what a dentist has to deal with. The narrator, however, says she is still scared to go to museums.

**Critique**: This fails to answer the question

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer fails to address the question, which is about what the story says regarding internet research. However, the critique does not provide any specific guidance or information on what the correct answer should include. Without additional details or direction, it is impossible to improve the answer solely based on the critique. The critique does not imply or suggest any specific content or corrections that would make the answer more relevant to the question.

What does the article say about drugs?

**Answer**: The narrator had turned to drugs to find happiness, after struggling with a very lonely, depression-ridden year. He compares the alternative of using drugs to turning to ordinary things in the real world which makes them happy. Drugs seem to be an extremely prevalent addiction for young people nowadays. The narrator adds that he might use drugs again, but not as a crutch to find happiness-a clear sign of this sudden maturity.

**Critique**: It is not stated that drugs seem to be an extremely prevalent addiction for young people nowadays. 

**Rationale**: The critique specifically points out that the statement about drugs being an extremely prevalent addiction for young people is not stated in the article. This implies that this part of the answer should be removed or revised. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the unsupported statement about the prevalence of drug addiction among young people.

Summarise how Barbot's actions were perceived as reckless regarding the covid pandemic and what led to her resignation from office.

**Answer**: Barbot was appointed Commissioner of Health of the City of New York in 2018 by Mayor Bill de Blasio, the first Latina to head the Health Department. She was criticized for saying people can't contract coronavirus through casual, short-term exposure, but instead require prolonged exposure to the infected person's secretions. She also denied a New York Police Department request for 500,000 surgical masks. Ultimately, she resigned from office on August 4, 2020.

**Critique**: The answer should mention Barbot's comments about COVID-19 at the start of the epidemic.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should include specific comments made by Barbot about COVID-19 at the start of the epidemic. However, it does not provide details about what those comments were. Without knowing the specific comments, I cannot improve the answer to include this information. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to know what to write.

AZ politicians John McCain and Jeff Flake speak against the remarks on Twitter. Mitch Mcconnell says he thinks the comments are not accurate.

**Critique**: John McCain, Jeff Flake, and Mitch McConnell aren't mentioned in the article. The sentences about them are made up.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the statements about John McCain, Jeff Flake, and Mitch McConnell are fabricated. This implies that these parts of the answer should be removed to improve accuracy. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement by eliminating the incorrect information, even though it doesn't specify what should replace it.

**Critique**: The answer omits the reactions from Hillary Clinton, Mia Love, Steve King, and Lindsay Graham.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies specific individuals whose reactions are missing from the answer. However, it does not provide any information about what these individuals said or how they reacted to Trump's remarks.

**Answer**: House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator Tom Cotton have rebuked President Trump for reportedly calling African countries "shitholes", saying the comments were "unfortunate" and "unhelpful". Senator Lindsey Graham has defended Trump, calling his comments "inappropriate" but not racist. Senator Dick Durbin alleges that Trump referred to African countries as "shitholes" several times during the immigration meeting. Meanwhile, the African Union has called for an apology from Trump for ignoring "the celebrated American creed and respect for diversity and human dignity". The world has reacted negatively to Trump's remarks, calling them "shocking" and "racist".

**Critique**: The international reaction to Trump's comments are beyond the scope of this question.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the international reaction is not relevant to the question, which asks for a summary of what other US politicians had to say about Trump's remarks. This implies that the part of the answer discussing the African Union and the world's reaction should be removed. The critique provides enough information to make this specific change without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 173/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what other US politicians had to say about Trump's remarks.

**Answer**: Several Republicans as well as Democrats criticized President Trump after he reportedly described countries in Africa as "shitholes." House Speaker Paul Ryan called the remarks "unfortunate" and "unhelpful," while Hillary Clinton said the country had been subjected to Trump's "ignorant, racist views of anyone who doesn't look like him." Republican Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue said they did not remember Mr Trump describing countries as "shitholes," but right-wing Congressman Steve King defended him by tweeting that the comments if confirmed were "shocking and shameful," but "there is no other word for this but racist." Haiti's US Ambassador Paul Altidor condemned the idea that "we're simply immigrants who come here to take advantage of the US."

**Critique**: Paul Altidor's position is both wrong and irrelevant to the question. The related sentence should be removed.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the sentence about Haiti's US Ambassador Paul Altidor is irrelevant to the question, which asks for a summary of US politicians' reactions to Trump's remarks. The critique provides clear guidance to remove this specific sentence, as it does not pertain to the opinions of US politicians. Therefore, the critique allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the irrelevant sentence.

**Answer**: In a bipartisan immigration meeting Trump said that the US should be taking more migrants from countries like Norway, and not from "shithole" countries such as Haiti. Trump denies the claims that he made the remarks, claiming he has "a wonderful relationship with Haitians." Trump ignored press questions regarding the issue.

**Critique**: Trump is alleged to have called African nations "shitholes". He asked whether the US needs more Haitians.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It clarifies that Trump allegedly referred to African nations as "shitholes" and questioned the need for more Haitians. This allows for a more accurate and detailed summary of Trump's remarks without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: According to reports, US President Donald Trump allegedly referred to African nations as "shitholes" during a meeting on Thursday to discuss immigration reform. Mr Trump has denied using the language reported and has said that his language at the meeting had been "tough". Critics, however, have denounced the alleged comments as racist. Mr Trump has given no apology and has said that there is a "huge misunderstanding of the African continent and its people by the current Administration".

**Critique**: The African Union's comments are attributed to Trump.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the comments attributed to Trump in the answer are actually from the African Union. This implies that the answer should be corrected to accurately reflect who made the comments. Specifically, the part of the answer that states "Mr Trump has given no apology and has said that there is a 'huge misunderstanding of the African continent and its people by the current Administration'" should be attributed to the African Union instead of Trump. This correction can be made without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides enough information to make the necessary change.

I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trust!".

**Critique**: The answer omits that Trump initially talked about African nations before commenting on Haiti. He's reported to have asked whether the US needs more Haitians while saying he didn't use the language reported, but he was tough.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It mentions that Trump initially talked about African nations before commenting on Haiti and that he questioned whether the US needs more Haitians.

**Answer**: According to reports, US President Donald Trump reportedly called African countries "shitholes" during a meeting on immigration on Thursday. Trump has denied using the insulting language and claimed that he did not say "take them out". The African Union denounced the remarks and called for an apology. Republican Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue have refuted Trump's remarks. The global reaction has been strong, with the UN calling them shocking and shameful. Haiti's US Ambassador strongly denied the idea that Haitian immigrants come to the US to take advantage.

**Critique**: The responses to Trump's comments from others aren't relevant to this question.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the responses from others to Trump's comments are not relevant to the question, which asks for a summary of Trump's remarks and his response to them. This implies that the answer should focus solely on what Trump said and how he responded, without including reactions from other parties. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the parts about the African Union, Republican Senators, the UN, and Haiti's US Ambassador, as these do not pertain directly to Trump's remarks or his response.

Summarize Trump's remarks and his response to them.

**Answer**: The President allegedly called African countries "shitholes" during immigration discussions. The press and many politic insiders have recounted the behavior, adding fuel to the controversy. Trump denies that he made the comment. Respondents say that Trump's honesty and willingness to use appropriate language will separate him from white supremacist tendencies. The President further states that Haitians are not people that are wanted in the United States, and would prefer to select immigrants from European nations.

**Critique**: "The press and many politic insiders have recounted the behavior, adding fuel to the controversy." This sentence is irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that a particular sentence is irrelevant, which provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer.

This implies that the current answer, which attempts to provide details about the accident, is incorrect. However, the critique does not provide any information on what should be included in the answer instead.

**Critique**: Qonqurtai's time as a commander isn't his childhood.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the information about Qonqurtai being a senior commander is not relevant to his early life, which is the focus of the question. This implies that the part about his time as a commander should be removed to better align the answer with the question.

**Answer**: The mine was owned by Cia. Minera Chungar, S.A.C. After the 1971 disaster, this mining company, keeping the same name, transferred the operations 16 km NE to the Animón mine in the Huarón Mining District. Between 1995 and 2008, Compañía Minera Cerro S.A. rehabilitated some underground workings and had a small scale operation. Since 2015, the mining company Volcan is exploring the surroundings of the Chungar Mine (Romina project) including the Puagjanca area where a Zn-Pb-(Ag) ore body was discovered.

**Critique**: The operation and the exploration are unrelated to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the details about the operation and exploration are not relevant to the question, which asks specifically about the mine's name. This implies that the answer should focus solely on information directly related to the name of the mine. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the parts about operations and exploration, leaving only the information that pertains to the name of the mine.

### Sample 208/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Aldi's divisions?

**Answer**: Aldi is divided into two divisions: Aldi Nord, which is run by Theo Albrecht, and Aldi Sud, which is run by Karl Albrecht. Theo expanded his empire into France, Spain, Portugal, and Poland while Karl expanded his into Britain and Australia. Both brothers built operations in the United States, Karl under the Aldi banner, and Theo as the owner of Trader Joe's chain of 340 "gourmet" grocery stores he acquired in 1979. The company is also divided into legally separate operating units.

**Critique**: It is omitted that they divided the map of Germany in half — along the so-called Aldi Equator — reportedly after disagreeing over whether or not to sell cigarettes. Theo took control of Aldi Nord, still based in Essen, while Karl, reputedly the more dynamic of the duo in their younger days, ran Aldi Sud from Essen’s sister city of Mulheim. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the division of Aldi's operations in Germany, including the "Aldi Equator" and the disagreement over selling cigarettes. It also specifies the locations of Aldi Nord and Aldi Sud's bases. This information allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding these details about the geographical and operational division within Germany, as well as the historical context of their disagreement.

### Sample 210/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the cost effectiveness of Aldi?

**Answer**: The secret to Aldi's success is that they offered a few hundred well chosen product lines at low prices and they followed a military style of organization. 

**Critique**: It is omitted that low prices are made possible by massive purchasing. This was combined with a high ratio of sales per square meter of floor space, and ferocious cost control — the latter being Theo’s special skill. Little money was wasted on marketing, and none at all on making Aldi stores look elegant: goods were simply piled up along the aisles in packing cases.


**Rationale**: The critique provides specific details that can be added to the answer to improve it. It mentions that low prices are achieved through massive purchasing, a high ratio of sales per square meter, and strict cost control. Additionally, it notes that Aldi spends little on marketing and does not invest in making stores look elegant.

What happens to the child?

**Answer**: The child is submerged in the water at the banks of the lake.

**Critique**: This response is correct but additional details of the child not wanting to be submerged and the child gasping for air when submerged need to be added to make the response stronger. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific additional details that can be included in the answer to make it stronger. It mentions that the child does not want to be submerged and gasps for air when submerged.

**Answer**: The child submits to being baptized and enters the water.

**Critique**: While this response is mostly accurate, it also needs to include more details about how the boy was not willing to be baptized and how the boy could have been drowned. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific details that are missing from the current answer, namely that the boy was not willing to be baptized and that there was a risk of drowning.

**Answer**: Trump describes Shanahan as having done a wonderful job, and says he looks forward to working with him for a long time to come. Trump says of Esper, "Mark Esper will be outstanding."

**Critique**: Trump looks forward to working with Esper, not Shanahan.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It corrects the misattribution of Trump's statement about looking forward to working with someone. The critique indicates that Trump actually looks forward to working with Esper, not Shanahan.

**Critique**: It is omitted that after the 2010 incident, Shanahan and then-wife Kimberley both told police the other punched them. Shanahan denied the allegations.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the controversy that was omitted from the original answer. It mentions that both Shanahan and his then-wife Kimberley accused each other of assault, and that Shanahan denied the allegations. This additional detail allows for a more complete and accurate summary of the controversy without needing to refer back to the source material.

Summarize the views of the opposing sides.

**Answer**: The New York City Department of Buildings fined Kushner Cos. $210,000 for falsifying building permit forms. While the city acknowledged the under-reporting of rent-regulated tenants, Kushner maintains that it relied on third party consultants for falsification and any errors would be fixed. Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, NPR reported New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo launched an investigation into the business practices of the Kushner Cos.

**Critique**: The last line is not relevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the last line of the answer is not relevant. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by removing the last line. The critique implies that the information about New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo launching an investigation is not necessary for summarizing the views of the opposing sides. Therefore, the answer can be improved by omitting this line, focusing solely on the views of the New York City Department of Buildings and Kushner Cos.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What are the reasons behind the peaceful man's continual visits to the cheerful woman's house?

**Answer**: The peaceful man and the cheerful woman were neighbors. None of them love to venture outside of their house. One day, a strange thing happened - the cheerful woman invited the man inside. The two neighbors shared stories and had fun. The next day, the peaceful man visited without being invited. Instead of talking, he started to repair broken down parts of the woman's house. The two neighbors began to visit each other regularly due to the friendship that has developed between them.

**Critique**: The response spends a lot of time talking about what happened during the visits, but not much about the reasons behind them.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer focuses more on the events during the visits rather than the reasons behind them. However, it does not provide specific information or suggestions on what the reasons might be. Without additional details or implications about the reasons for the visits, it is not possible to improve the answer solely based on the critique. The critique identifies a gap but does not provide enough information to fill it without referring back to the source material.

What are the reasons behind the peaceful man's continual visits to the cheerful woman's house?

**Answer**: The man visits the woman's house because he enjoys her company and finds comfort in the repairs she does for him. He also wants to repay her for the kindness she shows him.

**Critique**: The response says that the man finds comforts in the repairs the woman does and wants to repay her kindness, but the man was the one who started repairing her house. The response given would be a proper response to "What are the reasons behind the cheerful woman's continual visits to the peaceful man's house?"

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts the current answer and implies what the correct answer should be. It clarifies that the man is the one doing the repairs, not the woman, and suggests that the roles in the answer are reversed. Therefore, the critique allows us to correct the answer by focusing on the man's actions and motivations for visiting the woman's house, such as enjoying her company and possibly other reasons not related to repairs.

She also noticed his constant sorrow and decided to try to heal him by repairing his house and bringing joy back into his life. His initial help in her house led her to realize that other people do care, even though he does not believe that himself. It is this caring spirit that motivates him to keep coming back for more.

**Critique**: The response contains lots of information not found in the text.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why does the article contend that the massive layoffs happening in big companies wasn't supposed to be that way?

**Answer**: There was an expectation that governments would try to avert this sort of layoffs in favor of increasing decentralized jobs, which companies should work with. Randall Stephenson, the CEO of AT&T, pledged to increase investment in AT&T if Trump's tax cut gets passed. Such investments were withdrawn instead and resources redirected to buying back stocks and increasing executive salary.

**Critique**: This wasn't in the text and doesn't fit the context of the succeeding sentences. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that the information provided in the answer was not in the text and does not fit the context of the succeeding sentences. However, it does not provide any specific information or guidance on what the correct content should be.

**Answer**: Big firms had lobbied for tax cuts saying that they would use the money to invest in their companies and create jobs. Opponents said that the cuts would benefit the super-rich. The latter is exactly what happened. Investors benefited while big companies reduced investment and laid off workers. 

**Critique**: "laid off" - add a hyphen

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific and actionable suggestion to improve the answer by correcting the spelling of "laid off" to "laid-off." This is a clear instruction that can be implemented without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique directly addresses a typographical issue, allowing for a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Answer**: They cite CEO, Randall Stephenson of AT&T, who promised under Trump's tax cut bill to invest a billion dollars and create 7,000 jobs if the law went into effect. Supporters of the bill said it would fund job-creating expansions.

**Critique**: The response fails to mention that these promises weren't fulfilled. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the promises made by Randall Stephenson and supporters of the tax cut bill were not fulfilled. This provides enough information to improve the answer by adding a statement about the unfulfilled promises. Specifically, you can modify the answer to include that despite the promises, the expected job creation did not occur, which is why the article contends that the layoffs weren't supposed to happen.

### Sample 244/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why does the article contend that the massive layoffs happening in big companies wasn't supposed to be that way?

**Answer**: The article contends that CEOs of large companies promised to create jobs if the Trump tax cut bill passed, but rather than creating jobs they are now laying them off. The article contends this is not what the CEOs claimed they would do in relation to the Trump tax cut bill. The layoffs indicate that the promises made by CEOs related to the Trump tax cut bill have not been fulfilled.

**Critique**: Replace with "laying people off" and add "reneging on that promise". 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific instructions on how to improve the answer. It suggests replacing "laying them off" with "laying people off" and adding the phrase "reneging on that promise." These changes can be made directly to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique clearly indicates what needs to be modified and added.

**Critique**: The response failed to answer the question of what businesses did with the money. It needs to mention that big businesses bought back their own stock and gave salary increases to CEOs and other high-ranking corporate executives. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific actions that big businesses took with the money from the tax cuts, namely buying back their own stock and giving salary increases to CEOs and other high-ranking corporate executives.

**Critique**: "cut bill?" - seems like a typo or error that must be removed.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a likely typo or error ("cut bill?") in the answer. This is a clear indication that the phrase should be removed or corrected.

### Sample 249/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why did companies who had backed the tax cuts still lay people off?

**Answer**: Though these companies pledged to create jobs and invest in the workforce if the tax cuts passed, they instead have eliminated thousands of jobs and slashed investment, instead choosing to use their tax windfalls for share buybacks which primarily benefit top executives and wealthy investors. The tax cuts have not lived up to their promises, so companies are presumably just responding to consumer demand or other shifts in the market rather than creating jobs in compliance with their initial promises.

**Critique**: This part of the response is redundant and no longer answers the question. It should be revised to highlight that the companies are using the excuse of "responding to consumer demand and shifts in the market" for all the layoffs despite getting millions from the tax cuts. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to revise the answer. It suggests removing the redundant part and focusing on the companies' justification for layoffs, which is "responding to consumer demand and shifts in the market," despite receiving tax cuts. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 250/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why did companies who had backed the tax cuts still lay people off?

**Answer**: One reason is that technology and automation has made certain jobs either unnecessary or unprofitable, like telemarketing, certain customer service centers, and bank teller positions that are more easily facilitated by automated processes. Additionally, tax cuts have given companies an excuse to fortify themselves against big losses, like in the auto industry.

**Critique**: Some points in the response can't be substantiated by anything in the text. There was no mention of what types of jobs were threatened by automation, while companies fortifying themselves against big losses was not discussed. A full re-write is necessary. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer includes points that cannot be substantiated by the source material, specifically the types of jobs threatened by automation and the idea of companies fortifying themselves against big losses. However, the critique does not provide any specific information or alternative points that can be used to improve the answer. It simply states that a full re-write is necessary without offering guidance on what the correct information should be. Therefore, without access to the source material, it is not possible to write a better answer based solely on the question, current answer, and critique.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the primary source of tension in this story. 

**Answer**: The primary source of tension in this story is the main character's fate. He is an old man and he has been alone for what seems to be longer than imaginable. The sunspiders, his companions, die separately in their own heat. No thought is given to their longevity past one season. The main character does not age, but can still be damaged. Already he is injured from the tumble he took in this tale, after and time of hunting around deathly oven of the sunspiders joining together and using their power to send his consciousness up to near space. 

Now he is at the bottom of the outcropping, leaving a tumble trail of dried blood. The Sunspiders crawl up every single night, layer each other in a ballance of multicolored light, and focus them all on the old man, setting him ablaze. The old man, in his broken state, doesn't feel horror, but even more curiousity what their actions would mean. After he dies, they all scatter, the connected light dissipates, and they disperse to lay dormant. Apparently, it all means burying the old man.

**Critique**: There is no indication from the original text that the protagonist is an old man. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the protagonist is not an old man, which allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. By removing or altering the part of the answer that describes the protagonist as an old man, the answer can be improved without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 252/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the primary source of tension in this story. 

**Answer**: The primary tension of the story is a desire to understand the world and its history while simultaneously realizing that there might be nothing left to be discovered. The protagonist feels a connection to the Sunspiders, which has become their primary provider of light and power. However, as time goes on, it becomes increasingly clearer that this may be the only thing of its kind left in the world. The protagonist unexpectedly finds evidence of human remnants, but then realizes that these are likely from the past, and not the present. This leaves them feeling momentarily content, but ultimately alone and without answers. The Sunspiders then come to the rescue, providing them with a final send-off and closure.

**Critique**: The response does not mention that the Sunspiders end his life by setting him ablaze.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It mentions that the Sunspiders end the protagonist's life by setting him ablaze, which is a crucial detail about the story's tension and resolution. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding this detail to the summary of the primary source of tension.

### Sample 253/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the primary source of tension in this story. 

**Answer**: The primary source of tension throughout the story is that the narrator cannot locate a lost civilization (possibly). This is a source of frustration for the narrator because it is implied that this civilization may have had valuable artifacts that the narrator could collect. This is why the narrator hopes to find a remnant from before the change of human life that tried to survive. The ants are used to situate the story into the future, because the narrator wants to know if humans are still present and alive in this period, because it feels like they still have purpose.

In the last paragraphs of the story, it is revealed that the narrator has memory of water, and the setting of this story is recontextualized because the current story is conveyed in images that the protagonist absorbs and then utilizes that information to recreate images of his/her own imagining. This leads to clumps of Sunspiders becoming like a lens while they adjust to a plan and then focus the sun on the narrator. In the finale paragraph, the Sunspiders collect and focus their light to form a noose and then use the fire to carry out a funeral pyre for the narrator. So, it is implied that the Sunspiders worshipped the instructions and the performer of the rites of their own intentions.

**Critique**: There is no indication that the narrator is looking for valuable artifacts to collect. He simply stumbles upon them.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts a part of the current answer. It states that the narrator is not actively looking for valuable artifacts but instead stumbles upon them. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing or altering the part that suggests the narrator is seeking artifacts. The critique directly addresses a specific detail in the answer, making it possible to revise the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what this story says about seeing. 

**Answer**: The narrator describes how they believe that when they were younger they once were able to visualize the changes that have happened, as they were able to view clouds. As they grew older, they were not able to visualize the changes any more. This means that they were not able to do so by visualizing them in their mind, as one might with a specific image like a cloud. Considering the Sunspiders were able to digest the corpse of the narrator and the Sunspiders were able to reflect enough light to help create a funeral pyre, this shows that the Sunspiders are able to manipulate the light in their bodies in ways that the narrator was no longer able to.

**Critique**: The response does not transition well. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that "the response does not transition well," but it does not provide specific guidance on how to improve the transitions or which parts of the answer need better transitions. Without specific information on what transitions are lacking or how to improve them, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what this story says about seeing. 

**Answer**: Seeing something left behind from when the narrator was not alone is one of their main hopes but the narrator does not. The narrator checks the nearby outcroppings of rocks but doesn't find anything promising. If a "past-related object" is found then the narrator might not know what to do with it. The narrator needs to find a safe place to retire.

**Critique**: The response makes no mention of sight. It could just be left blank as well since the answer is only implied and not directly mentioned in the story.

However, it does not provide any specific information or guidance on how to correct or improve the answer to focus on the theme of sight. Without additional details or suggestions on what aspects of "seeing" should be included, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what this story says about seeing. 

**Answer**: First of all, this story seems to lend evidence in support of the old adage "seeing is believing". It becomes clear that one primary source of conflict is the narrator's self-admitted inability to distinguish between reality and fantasy, yet the narrator must forge a path through these treks despite what they are seeing. However, in the end, they must believe that the spiders mark their demise-whether the spiders are real or not, because there is no other way out of the cave but to become dust.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what motivates the narrator to keep going in this story.

**Answer**: The narrator seems driven by their sense of connection to the Sunspiders, and through that, connection to the world around them. They love the idea of contributing to the next generation and preserving themselves on a much grander scale through the Sunspiders. In their barren world, they have relied on the Sunspiders to be a focal point that connects them. When the Sunspiders begin to arrange themselves in a pattern above the narrator, they create a light show, and this final gift motivates the narrator to continue on their journey. The heat, the risk to their body, and the idea of the end being their funeral pyre keep the narrator going. Their goal is to find something that connects them to the world before, and the Sunspiders help them find an accessible connection.

**Critique**: The response does not mention that the narrator is convinced he is not the last man alive, and seeks civilization elsewhere. He uses this to motivate himself throughout his search.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It mentions that the narrator is motivated by the belief that he is not the last man alive and is seeking civilization elsewhere. This is a concrete detail that can be added to the current answer to enhance it without needing to refer back to the source material.

Describe the turning point in the story.

**Answer**: The Sunspiders begin grouping into several large clusters. The narrator realizes they are now forming a burning shield and focusing sunlight on the narrator. Attempting to move to recieve the sunlight, they realize they are broken and rolling down a hill to the bottom of the outcropping.

**Critique**: The outcropping happened before the narrator was set on fire by the spiders. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the sequence of events is incorrect, indicating that the outcropping occurred before the narrator was set on fire by the spiders. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by rearranging the events to reflect the correct order. The editor can adjust the narrative to show that the outcropping happened first, followed by the spiders forming a burning shield and setting the narrator on fire.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe the turning point in the story.

**Answer**: This story has a turning point when the narrator moves over a rugged surface and a line catches his eye that's not a mirage. Looking closer, they find a scrap of metal in the previously believed dead planet. The narrator sees it and forgets their situation, falling.

**Critique**: The turning point in the story is when the sunspiders decide to set the narrator on fire and end his suffering. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific alternative turning point in the story, which is when the sunspiders decide to set the narrator on fire to end his suffering.

### Sample 260/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe the turning point in the story.

**Answer**: The narrator is en route to finding the refuge they need from the elements when they are overtaken with what seems to be the sensation of endlessness-causing them to tumble through what might be a crevice and into a cave. This physical descent may also symbolize the descent into madness, as they become fully convinced they are seeing hundreds of spiders. Regardless of whether or not the narrator succumbs to the madness or injuries and exposure, it is clear that this is a turning point from which it might prove difficult to turn back. 

**Critique**: It is odd to use "might" in a situation that is impossible to turn back. The last sentence seems too unsure and does not answer the question accurately. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the use of "might" in the last sentence is inappropriate for a situation described as impossible to turn back from. This implies that the sentence should be more definitive about the turning point being irreversible. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to improve the answer by making the last sentence more assertive about the turning point's significance. For example, the sentence could be revised to: "This is a definitive turning point from which there is no return."

However, therapy and treatment have been extended to help out those affected by COVID-19.

**Critique**: There is no evidence in the text that suggest therapy as being extended to those affected.

**Rationale**: The critique specifically points out that there is no evidence in the text to support the claim that therapy and treatment have been extended to those affected by COVID-19.

What does the story say about the narrator's thoughts on their King?

**Answer**: The narrator thinks that their King is different from other people and is curious why this is the case. Out of curiosity, they get into his castle and ask him why he is different. The King shares his story and tells the narrator that he is a player, which is why he is different. The story ends with him taking the narrator on adventures and explaining things to them.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the narrator's thoughts on their King?

**Answer**: The King has always been different. He's very quiet and doesn't order anyone around. The King seems like he's a man of action who likes to create things and isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. He always leaves the kingdom and comes back with a bounty of different things, from pearls to bones and meat. The King has a lot of dogs and seems to bring a new one home every time he ventures out.

**Answer**: The narrator appears to respect their King for his intelligence and hard work. They are also jealous of his energy and bravery. It appears that the story has helped the narrator better understand their King and why he behaves differently than other people.

Clarify jealousy as curiosity and the story that the response refers to as being the life story of the king.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the narrator is curious, not jealous, about the king, and it specifies that the story referred to is the life story of the king.

### Sample 297/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the narrator's thoughts on their King?

**Answer**: The village the narrator lives in doesn't have the best facilities, with their castle appearing to be in disrepair at best and there is no way to trade with the outside world. The narrator is an inquisitive type, always trying to learn more about their King and why they live so differently to the rest of the people of the kingdom. The narrator respects their King but is dissatisfied with how things are. When the narrator finally gets their chance, they ask simple questions, but the King speaks at length to the player, excusing his manner as slightly eccentric but his character and behaviors are as normal as any other human. That changes when the narrator goes adventuring with their King and come to realise the other side of things - this isn't "real", this is a game, and human lives are just tracks of existence which vanish when the person in the game is permanently killed or feels the need to leave. The narration is a first-person viewpoint shot from the person playing the game (their character), speaking from their perspective in the game.

**Critique**: Remove the first sentence because it contains false information.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance to remove the first sentence of the answer because it contains false information. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: The king is different from everyone else in the kingdom, when the narrator confronts him he tells the narrator his own story of where he grew up in the same conditions as the narrator and also went to confront his king about being different from the other adults. After this the kingdom was destroyed, and the king fought for his life, eventually built a shelter and started mining. Thereby he built his own kingdom and people appeared to populate it.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about The King?

The King was inspired by the stories of his predecessor's death and he makes sure to always leave the kingdom and explore new things in order to better understand the real world. The King also has a deep understanding of the real world, considering how it is not as "real" as what people believe. The King is perceived by the narrator as being different and more knowledgeable about the world.

The king has been playing for so long that he has lost his ability to distinguish between reality and the game. He lives his life in the game by living near forests, killing zombies and not trying to collect a lot of resources.

### Sample 301/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What are the major reasons why some of the old, silent Danish films are being digitalized and made available for free?

**Answer**: First, a lot of the Danish silent films were sold to other film companies for resources when the silent era ended in the early 1930s. Also, it was found out that about 80% of all Danish silent films were put on their archive shelves, which is why a lot of these films never made it to theaters. Now that technology has advanced, a lot of people are curious to watch the old silent films, and so are students of film who are taking the study of history very seriously.

**Critique**: The highlighted text is inaccurate. There is no evidence of the sale of Danish silent films to other film companies. The production companies scrapped their inventories. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts the current answer, stating that there is no evidence of the sale of Danish silent films to other film companies and that the production companies scrapped their inventories instead. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the inaccurate statement about the sale and replacing it with the information about the scrapping of inventories.

Brazil, Mexico, and Panama are the first Latin American nations to suspend the Boeing 737 MAX. Panama's Copa Airlines had suspended operations of its six Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft until the findings are published of an investigation into the Sunday's crash.

**Critique**: The question's wording, "non-American countries", should be interpreted as "countries that aren't on a continent named America". Thus, Latin American countries shouldn't be mentioned.

**Rationale**: The critique provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by specifying that "non-American countries" should exclude Latin American countries. This implies that the references to Brazil, Mexico, and Panama should be removed from the answer. The remaining relevant information pertains to France, which is a non-American country.

Summarize the mentality of livestream viewers that Blevins is trying to deal with.

**Answer**: Although many Twitch streamers deal with problematic issues on the platform, such as harassment and invasive questions, Ninja's main concern is the gossip among viewers that may result from one conversation between him and a female streamer. The mentality of viewers seem to be that if women are involved in any way, they are up for public scrutiny.

**Critique**: More detail is necessary on the views of streamers themselves

**Rationale**: The critique requests more detail on the views of streamers themselves, but it does not provide any specific information or direction on what those views might be. Without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to improve the answer to include the views of streamers. The critique does not imply or suggest any specific content that could be added to the answer, leaving the editor without enough information to make a concrete improvement.

### Sample 324/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What draws the narrator away from the beach?

**Answer**: The smell of something cooking. The narrator thinks the smell is blood.

**Critique**: The narrator smelling iron and "something cooking" are different events, which the answer confuses.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer incorrectly combines two separate events: the narrator smelling iron and the smell of something cooking. This implies that the answer should distinguish between these two events. However, the critique does not provide enough information to clarify what specifically draws the narrator away from the beach. Without knowing the correct sequence or details of these events, I cannot accurately improve the answer. I would need to refer to the source material to determine the correct information.

### Sample 325/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe the woman.

**Answer**: The woman is gorgeous and looks Mediterranean. She has extremely long dark brown hair and dark brown eyes, she smells like honeysuckle and talks like an angel. She looks like she might be Aphrodite.

**Critique**: The narrator likens the woman to Aphrodite, that she may as well be a goddess. The answer slightly misrepresents this.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer misrepresents the comparison to Aphrodite. It suggests that the narrator's intention was to liken the woman to a goddess, not just to say she "looks like she might be Aphrodite." This implies that the description should emphasize the goddess-like qualities rather than a direct comparison to Aphrodite. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to adjust the description to better reflect the narrator's intended comparison without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 328/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is it hard for critics to accept that Mikhail Lesin killed himself?

**Answer**: It is common knowledge that Lesin was surrounded by controversy at the time of his death.
All other information in regards to his death has been scrubbed from the public record.

**Critique**: The response is a little vague and needs more details. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is vague and lacks detail, but it does not provide specific information or details that could be added to improve the answer. Without additional information or specific suggestions from the critique, it is not possible to enhance the answer without referring back to the source material to understand what details are missing or what specific controversies surrounded Lesin's death.

### Sample 329/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the main news event.

**Answer**: 16 year-old Kyle Kashuv attended a school shooting with 17 classmates killed. He survived and later defended the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution -the right to bear arms.
Kashuv organized the Turning Point USA High School Leadership Summit being addressed by U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Sen. Orrin Hatch, and other conservative luminaries.

**Critique**: The verb "attend" is not used for a school shooting since it, for anyone other than the shooter, is not a planned event. Adjust the first sentence to reflect this properly.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific feedback on the inappropriate use of the verb "attend" in the context of a school shooting. It suggests that the verb should be changed to accurately reflect the nature of the event as something that was not planned or attended by choice. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by selecting a more appropriate verb, such as "experienced" or "survived," to describe Kyle Kashuv's presence during the school shooting.

Summarize the main news event.

**Answer**: Kyle Kashuv, a survivor of the deadly Parkland shooting, is promoted a conservative champion due to his active support of the second amendment, and his planning of a major high school conservative conference.

**Critique**: Mention that the other survivors do not share his views and as such, Kashuv has more challenges to deal with.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests adding information about the differing views of other survivors, which implies that Kashuv faces additional challenges because of these differences. However, it does not specify what those challenges are or how they relate to the main news event. Without knowing the specific challenges or how they impact the event, I cannot concretely improve the answer. The critique requires additional information from the source material to be actionable.

**Critique**: "a proximity" should be "located in proximity"

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific correction to the phrasing in the answer. It indicates that "a proximity" should be changed to "located in proximity." This is a clear and actionable suggestion that allows for an improvement in the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: Second line is unnecessary.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the "second line is unnecessary," which provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer. By removing the second line, the answer can be improved without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique implies that the first line sufficiently summarizes the relationship between Hermann's childhood and his lifestyle related to mountain climbing.

### Sample 337/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize how businesses might make an incorrect or false statement in advertising. 

**Answer**: There are two types of statements - those relating to the product or service and those in terms of comparative claims. Some examples made in an inaccurate way include not disclosing that the available product is different from another claimed product or the like. The issue of availability also causes a problem in advertising because the available stock might be less than the advertised amount. This can be related to pricing and create confusion when the context is highly variable.

**Critique**: I would delete 'his can be related to pricing and create confusion when the context is highly variable' as it is not stated.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests deleting a specific part of the answer: "his can be related to pricing and create confusion when the context is highly variable." This is a clear directive to remove a specific sentence, which can be done without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the specified sentence.

### Sample 338/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize how businesses might make an incorrect or false statement in advertising. 

**Answer**: Businesses are barred from making false claims about any aspect of the product. That includes the superficial and cosmetic aspects of the product, such as height or weight. It also extends to the functionality of the product-for example, a business cannot sell you a cell phone and plan knowing you will not be able to have coverage with it in your area. They also cannot tell you that something was sold for more than the price tag when it was never sold at that price by them. Real estate agents are barred from selling properties under false premises such as location-a home could not be shilled as a lakefront home if it is not in fact on a lake. 

**Critique**: Lake is not mentioned, but a beach.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It indicates that the example given about real estate should refer to a beach rather than a lake. This implies that the statement about a home being falsely advertised as a lakefront property should be corrected to reflect a beach instead. Therefore, the answer can be improved by changing "lakefront home" to "beachfront home."

### Sample 339/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize how businesses might make an incorrect or false statement in advertising. 

**Answer**: According to this article, a business cannot make false claims about: 

- the quality, style, model or history of a product or service
- whether the goods are new
- whether the goods are new
- the sponsorship, performance, accessories, rewards, or use of products and services
- the availability of repair facilities or spare parts
- the need for the goods or services
- the exclusions on the goods and services

**Critique**: Rather 'might make' than 'cannot make'.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests changing the phrasing from "cannot make" to "might make," which implies that the focus should be on how businesses could potentially make incorrect or false statements, rather than stating what they are prohibited from doing. This change in wording shifts the perspective from a legal or regulatory standpoint to a more hypothetical or potential scenario. The critique provides enough information to make this adjustment without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 340/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize how businesses might make an incorrect or false statement in advertising. 

**Answer**: Businesses might make false or misleading statements in their advertising by exaggerating positives about their products or services, using misleading comparisons, promoting products that are not in stock or available for a limited time, and making environmental claims without proof.

**Critique**: I would add that they might make incorrect claims about the quality of a product, its history, availability of repair facilities or spare parts, or the necessary condition for its use.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific additional points that can be directly incorporated into the answer. It suggests adding information about incorrect claims regarding the quality of a product, its history, availability of repair facilities or spare parts, and the necessary condition for its use. These are concrete details that can be added to improve the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: Some of the most common types of advertising that may be considered misleading are false or exaggerated claims about the quality, style, model, benefits or exclusions of a product, unattainable 'sales', and environmental advertising that is not substantiated. Drip pricing, organic claims, and social media posts about products or services may also be considered misleading practices.

**Critique**: The answer lists behavior that is illegal.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer lists behavior that is illegal, but it does not specify which parts of the answer are illegal or provide any guidance on what legal but questionable tactics should be included instead.

**Critique**: Making false claims about the quality of a product or service is illegal.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the example given in the answer is incorrect because making false claims about the quality of a product or service is illegal. However, the critique does not provide an alternative example of a questionable but legal tactic in business advertising. Without additional information or examples, I cannot improve the answer to include a correct example of a legal but questionable tactic.

### Sample 344/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What are some questionable tactics in business advertising that are still legal?

**Answer**: One is that you can be sold a product under the assumed guise of its being perfectly usable without any additional parts or services. If a cell phone company offers to sell you a phone and nowhere does it state you are also getting a contract and/or sim card, the cell phone will not work, but the company is not obligated to make it work for free. Businesses can also deceive you by selling you a fish tank that does not work without a pump without stating it is necessary-it is sufficient to state on the packaging that a pump is sold separately. This goes for services (in the case of the cell service) and products (the fish tank example). 

**Critique**: The answer describes illegal behavior. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer describes illegal behavior, but it does not provide any information on what constitutes legal but questionable tactics. Without additional details or examples of legal tactics, I cannot improve the answer. The critique does not offer an alternative or correct the information provided in the answer, nor does it imply what the correct information might be. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to determine what legal tactics could be included.

**Critique**: Questionable tactics in business advertising are bait advertising, comparative advertising, and green claims are illegal.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the tactics mentioned in the answer are illegal, which contradicts the question's requirement for tactics that are still legal. However, the critique does not provide any information on what tactics are considered questionable yet legal. Without additional information or examples of legal tactics, I cannot improve the answer.

### Sample 346/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what might happen if an unscrupulous company sells a weight loss tea without much scientific backing or FDA approval. 

**Answer**: This would fall under the category of false claims if the business cannot substantiate their promises. If the product promises to aid in weight loss but there is no evidence to support the claim, the user might be entitled to some money back. However, that depends on the fine print-a business can use that space to cite statistics that are either nebulous or true but unsavory or both. For example, they might say something with an asterik along the lines of, "three percent of users see a one pound weight loss in the first five months". Therefore the product does technically work according to their loose guidelines, but that's not a result with which very many users would be happy. 

**Critique**: Should be 'asterisk' instead of 'asterik'.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about a spelling error in the answer. It indicates that the word "asterik" should be corrected to "asterisk." This is a clear and actionable piece of feedback that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

Summarize what might happen if an unscrupulous company sells a weight loss tea without much scientific backing or FDA approval. 

**Answer**: If a company were to advertise a weight loss tea without legitimate scientific support or FDA approval, the advertisement would likely be false or misleading. This might cause consumers to be misled about the efficacy of the product.

**Critique**: I would add: It is implied that people could sue the company.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests adding information about the potential legal consequences for the company, specifically that people could sue the company. This provides a specific action that can be taken to improve the answer by including the possibility of legal action, which is a concrete improvement.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what might happen if an unscrupulous company sells a weight loss tea without much scientific backing or FDA approval. 

**Answer**: If it advertises it as a tea that 'clinically proven to melt fat', this would be an exception to the 'puffery' exception as some fact must be inherent in that claim. Typically, 'natural' or 'organic' claims imply a scientific basis to the claim, and is looked at hypothetically, rather than a claim.

**Critique**: It is not said that 'natural' or 'organic' claims imply a scientific basis to the claim, and is looked at hypothetically, rather than a claim.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about 'natural' or 'organic' claims implying a scientific basis is incorrect. However, it does not provide information on what the correct interpretation or implication of such claims should be. Without additional information, I cannot improve the answer to accurately reflect the implications of 'natural' or 'organic' claims.

### Sample 365/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about how the narrator predicts the future?

**Answer**: The narrator only focuses on his own problems, and what he needs to do to fix them. He ruminates on the world personal-y as if they're personal-y there. He sees the past, his time, as the base and future. The world has become hotter and still warming over time. India and Pakistan half-wiped each other off of the map, and they called it the end of things. Then another day of world peace came, then months. The world has run out of water, and no one was the one to stop first. Many world leaders must have committed suicide in the coming months, but the narrator is glad to have his own fate already revealed to him. The future holds death for everyone as temperatures (at 6.5 degrees) and population (9 billion) peak. The pronostic in two years' time has 54% survival with 54% failure (.06% survival rate) after three decades.

**Critique**: A large chunk of the text is irrelevant from what is being asked. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that a large chunk of the text is irrelevant to the question, which asks about how the narrator predicts the future. However, it does not specify which parts of the answer are irrelevant or which parts should be retained to focus on the narrator's method of predicting the future. Without specific guidance on which sections to remove or keep, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to determine what is relevant to the narrator's prediction methods.

**Answer**: The small girl that the narrator and his squad found at the beginning of the story says that the ones who had promised to save them were the ones who set the doom upon them. Then, she kills the narrator. The girl is actually an alien.

**Critique**: It's not totally clear if the girl is an alien. It would be better to use speculative terms or note she has special powers.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests using speculative terms or noting that the girl has special powers instead of definitively stating she is an alien. This provides a clear direction for how to modify the answer to align with the critique's feedback. Specifically, the answer can be improved by changing the definitive statement "The girl is actually an alien" to something more speculative, such as "The girl may have alien origins or possesses special powers." This change can be made without needing to refer back to the source material.

What statistic is missing in this article and why is it important?

**Answer**: The article does not mention the average income of a UK commuter. This is important because it allows the reader to assess the affordability of season tickets in the UK.

**Critique**: The response says that the article doesn't mention the average income of a UK commuter, however it does mention that the cost of a season ticket is 13% of a salary.

**Rationale**: The critique provides information that the article does mention the cost of a season ticket as a percentage of a salary, which implies that the average income of a UK commuter can be inferred from this information. Therefore, the critique suggests that the original answer's claim about the missing statistic is incorrect. Using this critique, the answer can be improved by acknowledging the provided statistic and explaining its relevance to assessing affordability.

**Answer**: 2000 was the year in which the world was founded, so 2018 was the year in which the narrator coined the term "the new millennium", 700 years after the founding of the world as they knew it, at least as a Twitter buzz. Temperature rose by 4.6 degrees Celsius. The early stages were characterized by fever which doctors thought of as influenza-like symptoms. 7.6 billion people, of 9.8 billion, died. India and Pakistan nearly wiped each other off the map. There, water first ran out. The years that came after brought the same news of war and even more famine. The world became a desert. The narrator donated his body for experimentation so that scientists would understand the prognosis and possible solutions to this new pandemic.

**Critique**: The first line of the answer is highly inaccurate and not according to the story and should be removed or written accurately.

**Rationale**: The critique specifically points out that the first line of the answer is highly inaccurate and suggests that it should be removed or rewritten accurately.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about how the world changed from 2000 to 2047? 

**Answer**: The story suggests that, by 2047, the world had already begun to crumble and the U.S. was partly to blame. Due to population growth, a variety of issues ranging from climate change to war, there is a 70% global mortality rate and a 54% chance of survival for those who are left.

**Critique**: Nowhere in the story indicated that the U.S was partly to blame for the global damage. The model made that up and should remove that answer line and replace it with something accurate.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the statement about the U.S. being partly to blame is incorrect and should be removed. However, it does not provide any information on what should replace it, only that it should be replaced with something accurate. Without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to determine what the accurate replacement should be.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about how the narrator predicts the future?

**Answer**: The narrator predicts the future based on an outbreak of the ebola virus. He knows that there was no major war or conflict reported globally during the first 6 months of the new millennium. He also predicts that the next 3 decades would be mostly desert due to a rise in the global temperature. He cites negative probabilities for development for extinction facilities for the ebola virus.

**Critique**: The first and last lines of the answer are inaccurate and not according to the text. Those lines should be written more accurately.
The story does not say the world would be mostly desert in the next three decades because of a temperature rise; instead, it mentions the countries that would become deserts by then. The response should restructure this aspect of the answer.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer. It indicates that the first and last lines are inaccurate and need to be rewritten, and it clarifies that the story mentions specific countries becoming deserts rather than a general global temperature rise leading to deserts. This information allows for concrete improvements to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: The narrator believes that average global temperature will exceed 6.5 Degree's Celsius within 3 decades. Most of the world will become desert. They predict that mortality rate will dramaticly increase. 

**Critique**: 'Dramatically' is wrongly spelled, the model omits the article 'the' before 'mortality' and 'average,' and 'degrees' should not have an apostrophe before the 's.' All these should be corrected.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections for spelling and grammatical errors in the answer. It identifies the misspelling of "dramatically," the omission of the article "the" before "mortality" and "average," and the incorrect use of an apostrophe in "degrees."

The story also suggests that the current level of global conflict and violence will contribute to the likelihood of total global annihilation.

**Critique**: Cataclysmic and catastrophe mean the same thing. Using both words in the same sentence is redundant. The model should eliminate one of them.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a redundancy in the use of "cataclysmic" and "catastrophic," suggesting that one of these words should be removed to improve the clarity and conciseness of the answer. This is a specific and actionable suggestion that can be implemented without needing to refer back to the source material. By removing one of the redundant words, the sentence becomes clearer and more concise.

### Sample 399/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about what led to James Butler's very ordinary life?


**Answer**: James Butler's ordinary life is the result of an extraordinary event that occurred in his life. He lost his wife and first child in a car accident, and he was never able to recover from the tragedy. He was an ordinary man who lived an ordinary life, and he never found joy in anything again.

**Critique**: James Butler's life after the death of his wife and child is irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the information about James Butler's life after the death of his wife and child is irrelevant. This implies that the focus should be on what led to his ordinary life, not on the aftermath of the tragedy. Therefore, the critique suggests removing the part about his life after the accident. However, it does not provide any information on what should be included to explain what led to his ordinary life. Without additional details on what specifically led to his ordinary life, I cannot improve the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

### Sample 400/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about how James Butler's late wife and children returned to him?


**Answer**: After James Butler's wife and first child passed in a car accident and left him, memories of what his life could've been were fleeting. As a solution to his seething, sadness and grief, his wife and children returned to him, visiting him from time to time, the latter growing up into an extraordinary James Butler while under his watchful eye. However, the mother (presumably dead) and children were only apparitions, figments of a shattered reconciliation that never materialized due to James Butler's continued mourning and sorrow, which rotted him down to a day-to-day shell of an existence.

**Critique**: While the answer correctly states that Butler's wife and child returned to him as hallucinations, its extraneous commentary is unnecessary, irrelevant, and contradictory to the story.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer correctly identifies that Butler's wife and child returned to him as hallucinations. However, it also points out that the additional commentary is unnecessary, irrelevant, and contradictory. This implies that the answer should be revised to focus solely on the fact that the wife and child returned as hallucinations, without the additional commentary. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to improve the answer by removing the extraneous parts.

He remembers how it all started and how devastated he was when she died. In paragraph 8, he cries uncontrollably. He waits to die at her feet.

**Critique**: This does not happen in paragraph 8. It should be omitted

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the events described in paragraph 8 do not occur, and it suggests that this part should be omitted. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by removing the incorrect information about paragraph 8. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is the protagonist's sentiment about death?

**Answer**: He does not fear death and accepts that it's inevitable.

**Critique**: The author doesn't necessarily say that they don't fear death, but that death is not fear.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests a subtle but important distinction in the protagonist's sentiment about death. It implies that the protagonist's view is not about lacking fear, but rather about the nature of death itself not being something to fear. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by rephrasing it to reflect this nuance. For example, the answer could be revised to: "He views death as not something to fear and accepts its inevitability." This change aligns with the critique's implication without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: This answer is incorrect. The answer doesn't mention anything about not being curious enough to witness death.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the current answer is incorrect because it includes a statement about the protagonist not being curious enough to witness death, which is not supported. However, the critique does not provide any information about what the protagonist's actual sentiment about death is. Without knowing what the correct sentiment is, I cannot improve the answer.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies that the birthplace of Caroline M. Dodson is incorrect in the answer, but it does not provide the correct birthplace.

Many council members were against the proposal saying that it simply doesn't fit in with the progress of Nashville at all. Many people were also opposed to the proposed location, next to the Adelphia Coliseum and Downtown Nashville.

**Critique**: This should mention the financial concerns as well. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should include information about financial concerns related to the opposition against the proposed Thrillopolis amusement park. However, it does not specify what those financial concerns are. Without additional details, such as what specific financial concerns were raised or how they contributed to the opposition, it is not possible to improve the answer.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the police do not actually summon "Pee Man," but only almost summon him. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing or correcting the part about the police actually summoning "Pee Man." The critique implies that the answer should focus on the near-summoning rather than an actual summoning, which can be adjusted without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: It is clear that the person she loves is a woman. The narrator cannot have children so he or she cannot be the father of the child. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts the current answer, allowing for concrete improvements.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Explain what the narrator is and has become.

**Answer**: The narrator has had a heart transplant due to cardiac failure and will go into cardiac arrest without it.

**Critique**: There's no mention of a cardiac arrest or heart attack the narrator suffered previously.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the current answer incorrectly mentions a cardiac arrest or heart attack, which is not supported by the source material. However, the critique does not provide any information on what the correct details about the narrator's condition or transformation are. Without additional information on what the narrator is or has become, I cannot improve the answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the plot twist. 

**Answer**: This story starts with the narrator on an operating table, however it's for a heart transplant. He feels odd being on the table, not being able to feel his heart, but notices that it's not beating.

**Critique**: There's no real plot twist.

**Rationale**: The critique states that there is no real plot twist, which directly contradicts the premise of the answer. This implies that the entire premise of the answer is incorrect. As an editor, I can improve the answer by removing the incorrect information about the plot twist, as the critique suggests that the current answer is based on a false premise. However, without additional information from the source, I cannot provide an accurate summary of the actual plot twist or lack thereof. Therefore, while I can remove the incorrect information, I cannot replace it with the correct plot twist or confirm the absence of one without the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the plot twist. 

**Answer**: The narrator has no heart and all he really wants is a cigarette.

**Critique**: There's no real plot twist.

**Rationale**: The critique states that there is no real plot twist, which directly contradicts the current answer that suggests a plot twist involving the narrator having no heart and wanting a cigarette. This implies that the entire premise of the answer is incorrect. Therefore, the action to take is to remove the mention of a plot twist entirely. The critique provides enough information to improve the answer by eliminating the incorrect statement about a plot twist, even though it doesn't specify what the correct plot point is. The improvement is to acknowledge that there is no plot twist, which aligns with the critique.

It's also mentioned that when his battery packs die, he'll die.

**Critique**: There's no real plot twist.

**Rationale**: The critique states that there is no real plot twist, which implies that the current answer incorrectly suggests there is a plot twist. However, the critique does not provide any information on what the actual plot or key elements are, nor does it suggest how to correct the answer to accurately summarize the plot. Without additional information on what constitutes the plot or any twist, it is not possible to improve the answer based solely on the critique.

### Sample 436/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the narrator's relationship with Minnie. 

**Answer**: Minnie is the narrator's wife. She is concerned about her husband's new heart and how it will affect him. She has a habit of saying "I told you so" when she is right.

**Critique**: Minnie is slightly implied to be the narrator's wife, but that's not directly stated.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the relationship between Minnie and the narrator is not explicitly stated as husband and wife, but only implied. To improve the answer, you can remove the direct statement that Minnie is the narrator's wife and instead describe the relationship in a way that reflects the implication without making a definitive statement. For example, you could say, "Minnie is closely connected to the narrator and is concerned about his new heart and how it will affect him. She has a habit of saying 'I told you so' when she is right." This adjustment aligns with the critique and does not require additional information from the source material.

**Answer**: Minnie is the narrator's wife. She is concerned about the narrator's decision to get a new heart. She is always concerned about the narrator's health and safety. She is always worried about the narrator's health and safety.

**Critique**: Minnie is implied to be the narrator's wife, not directly stated.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the statement "Minnie is the narrator's wife" is not directly supported by the source material, but rather implied. To improve the answer, I would need to adjust the language to reflect that Minnie's relationship as the narrator's wife is implied rather than explicitly stated. However, the critique does not provide enough information to determine how to accurately describe their relationship without potentially misrepresenting the source material. Therefore, I cannot confidently improve the answer without consulting the source.

Summarize the plus side of the narrator's situation, and the negative side. 

**Answer**: The narrator is in a hospital room, and the doctor tells him that he has a new heart. The narrator's heart is fine, but he is on something. The narrator finds it odd that his heart rate stays the same as he coughs. 

The narrator is told that he has two battery packs built into his chest. If he fails to recharge one battery pack, he dies. The narrator wants a cigarette.

**Critique**: The first paragraph expresses the narrator's new condition poorly. He has a new mechanical heart, and the dizziness is from the anesthesia.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the narrator's condition, stating that the narrator has a new mechanical heart and that the dizziness is due to anesthesia. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by clarifying the narrator's medical situation. The critique implies that the current description of the narrator's condition is inaccurate and provides the correct details needed to improve the answer.

**Critique**: The narrator's worries about Minnie aren't because of her reaction to the surgery. It's about the surgery becoming supporting evidence for her complaints.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the narrator's worries regarding Minnie. It clarifies that the concern is not about her reaction to the surgery itself, but rather about the surgery becoming supporting evidence for her complaints. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adjusting the explanation of the narrator's worries. The editor can revise the answer to accurately reflect the nature of the narrator's concerns about Minnie without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: LaFleur made several questionable decisions. He had 4th & 2 from the Eagles 13-yard line, with his team leading 10-7. The Packers had been moving up and down the field. LaFleur took a page straight from the Sean McVay playbook and kicked the FG. That gave the Packers a whopping 13-7 lead. Where is the aggression? Why wouldn’t you trust Aaron Rodgers to make a play there? If you fail, you’re still up 10-7. LaFleur made some questionable play-calls.

**Critique**: A lot of the response is lifted from the passage.

**Rationale**: The critique states that "a lot of the response is lifted from the passage," but it does not provide specific guidance on how to improve the answer. It does not indicate which parts are problematic or suggest any alternative content or structure. Without knowing which parts are considered lifted or what the original passage contains, it is impossible to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Critique**: Chad may think that he is the only survivor but there is at least one other person on board the space ship

**Rationale**: The critique provides new information that there is at least one other person on board the spaceship, which implies that Chad is not the only survivor. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the statement about Chad being the only survivor.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Based on this article, how does the author likely see themselves and their political views relative to former POTUS Donald Trump?

**Answer**: The author likely doesn't see themselves as morally better than President Trump. The author likely has a good understanding of his or her own flaws and shortcomings, and pronounces their moral credentials with extreme humility. They say their views are the sane ones against the angry and divisive Trump. They say that Trump is a hate-filled and hateful guy, but so is their reading of Trump. What seems clear is the author thinks their views must prevail in the marketplace of ideas.

**Critique**: There is nothing in the article to support this pronouncement.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Based on this article, how does the author likely see themselves and their political views relative to former POTUS Donald Trump?

**Answer**: The author likely sees themselves as a more moderate Republican who is not as extreme as Trump.

**Critique**: There is no evidence that the author is a Republican.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that there is no evidence to support the claim that the author is a Republican. This implies that the part of the answer stating the author is a "moderate Republican" should be removed or revised to reflect a more neutral stance.

Therefore, without additional information from the source, it is not possible to accurately revise the answer to reflect the author's political views relative to Trump.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

**Answer**: The main source of tension in the story is the fact that the narrator is dying. The narrator is in a hospital and the doctor tells him that he has only a few months left to live. The narrator is also struggling to identify the color of the carpet in the room.

**Critique**: The main source of tension is that the narrator is fixated on the color of the carpet in the doctor's waiting room instead of focusing on why he is at the doctor's.

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific point of focus for the tension in the story, which is the narrator's fixation on the color of the carpet in the doctor's waiting room. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by shifting the emphasis from the narrator's impending death to his preoccupation with the carpet color.

**Answer**: Blocker is terminally ill, and the man with glasses tells him he only has a few months left. Blocker then realizes he has been fixated on the carpet, which is the color taupe. He cries.

**Critique**: This could be phrased differently to tie in better with the reveal. It should be said that Blocker only acknowledges this news and cries after he realizes what the color of the carpet is.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests a rephrasing to better align the sequence of events with the reveal. It implies that the realization of the carpet's color is a pivotal moment that leads to Blocker's emotional response. This provides enough information to adjust the phrasing of the answer to emphasize the sequence: Blocker acknowledges the news and cries after realizing the carpet's color.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What are the ways the story depicts Mr. Blocker as not normal?

**Answer**: Mr. Blocker is not social and does not want to make eye contact. He stares at the taupe carpet as it is the only thing that interests him. He is described as having a sad demeanor. He is not occupied with his phone or any magazines. He does not look pleased with the news that he might have only a few months left to live. He seems to have no interest in anything but the carpet.

**Critique**: This isn't necessarily why Blocker isn't normal. It would be better to omit this.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the current answer does not accurately depict why Mr. Blocker is considered "not normal" and recommends omitting the provided details. However, it does not provide any specific information or alternative details that could be used to improve the answer. Without additional information or guidance on what aspects of Mr. Blocker's behavior or characteristics should be highlighted to depict him as "not normal," it is not possible to improve the answer based solely on the critique.

What does the text say about the Super Reboot Resurfacing Mask?

**Answer**: The Super Reboot Resurfacing Mask is one of the five new Peach & Lily products that were recently launched. It sold out within minutes of launching. The Super Reboot Resurfacing Mask is a wash-off formula good at "de-gunking" skin through gentle exfoliating (resurfacing). Peach & Lily did a great job of marketing the product on Instagram, which was probably part of the reason why it sold out fast. 

**Critique**: Peach & Lily's products, including the mask, don't use problematic ingredients, which the answer should mention.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the current answer. It states that Peach & Lily's products, including the Super Reboot Resurfacing Mask, do not use problematic ingredients.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a contradiction in the answer regarding the launch timing of Peach & Lily's skin-care collection.

The brand has sworn off using animal fats, detergents, mineral oil, parabens, petrolatum, phthalates, and synthetic fragrances, everything skin-care shoppers would like to avoid.

**Critique**: The answer mistakenly calls the Korean company "English" and claims they "introduced their own brands". These are wrong. Peach & Lily was a retailer selling the products of other K-beauty brands.

It identifies that Peach & Lily is incorrectly described as an "English" company and clarifies that they did not introduce their own brands but were a retailer selling other K-beauty brands.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize why Jeff became fixated on this one girl he doesn't know as opposed to harboring a crush on other women in his life he does know.

**Answer**: Jeff knew the girl in his statistics class because she would be on time and sit in the same spot every Wednesday. He would spend hours daydreaming about asking her to coffee or to the movies, but he was too shy to do it. This girl stands out in an otherwise-typical college student community because she's the only one wearing a sunflower dress and dark hair. He sees her before class and at the end of class, but he never speaks to her. He loses her wallet and she returns it to him. She tells him she has been waiting to ask him out, but she was too scared. Summer is Jeff's dream girl.

**Critique**: The response is more of a summary of Summer in general; there is no explanation in the text for why Jeffery liked someone he didn't know very well.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the current answer does not address the specific question of why Jeff became fixated on this one girl he doesn't know, as opposed to other women he does know. However, the critique does not provide any information or implications about what the correct explanation might be.

Explain how Sharon is going to get herself out of the situation now that Melissa and other guests have arrived, and Mike is lying there dead.

**Answer**: Sharon is going to pretend that nothing happened and that Mike is still alive.

**Critique**: It is not stated nor implied that Sharon is going to pretend that nothing happened and that Mike is still alive.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer is incorrect because it is neither stated nor implied that Sharon will pretend nothing happened and that Mike is still alive. However, the critique does not provide any information or implications about what Sharon will actually do to get out of the situation. Without additional details or suggestions from the critique, it is impossible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand Sharon's actual plan or actions.

### Sample 498/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Explain in 3-5 sentences why it might have been important for Captain Roberts to give Chad a "command" even though there was nobody there.

**Answer**: It might be implied that being a commander of the ship is important even when there is nobody there to follow. Another reason could be that, perhaps even after his passing, Chad feels that it is important for him to have some authority over the ship, to be able to go on living.

**Critique**: The first sentence is just repeating what is already in the question.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the first sentence of the answer is redundant because it merely restates the information given in the question.

### Sample 500/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the origins of the Mechanics Educational Society of America. 

**Answer**: Before being established explicitly as a trade union, the Mechanics Educational Society of America was founded as an educational society by disgruntled members of the International Association of Machinists with support from radical transplants from the UK's trade union scene. Then, it became a full-fledged union a year before its founding when the government ratified the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933.

**Critique**: An organization cannot exist before its founding - the last sentence is contradictory.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a contradiction in the answer regarding the timeline of the organization's founding. It implies that the statement about the organization existing as a union before its founding is incorrect. To improve the answer, you would remove or correct the contradictory statement about the organization being a union before its founding.

Summarize the most interesting facts in the text. 

**Answer**: The Mechanics Educational Society of America was founded in 1933 by disgruntled members of the International Association of Machinists. Matthew Smith, Frank McCracken, and John Anderson pushed for a full-fledged union. In June 1933, the U.S. Congress passed the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 which protected the collective bargaining rights of unions. A month later, MESA began an organizing drive in Detroit, Pontiac, Michigan, and Flint, Michigan.

**Critique**: The response left out key happenings in MESA's history.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is missing important events in MESA's history but does not specify what those events are.

### Sample 503/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What other organizations can be inspired or learn from the Mechanics Educational Society of America?

**Answer**: The Mechanics did not affiliate with any major union for many years. Another independence was beneficial for the survival of the young union and its members. However, by the end of WWII, the Mechanics found a need to affiliate with a larger organization. It was necessary to be affiliated with an international union rather than national one. It was also wise to be a part of a larger labor movement.

**Critique**: The response seems to be critiquing the MESA and not answering the question.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the current answer does not address the question about which organizations can be inspired by or learn from the Mechanics Educational Society of America (MESA). However, it does not provide any information or suggestions on what the correct answer should include. Without additional details or examples of organizations that could be inspired by MESA, it is impossible to improve the answer based solely on the critique.

### Sample 506/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the moral of the story. 

**Answer**: The moral of the story, as far as I can tell, is that you should be thankful for what you have, and not be too greedy to want more. The narrator does offer up a positive spin on this, by saying that Pete should 'enjoy the rest of his time at the fair' but I don't think that this makes the moral any less dark. The narrator is saying that even Pete's life is worthless, and he should be thankful for the opportunity to feel less than worthless.

**Critique**: It is not stated that the narrator is saying that even Pete's life is worthless, and he should be thankful for the opportunity to feel less than worthless.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about the narrator implying Pete's life is worthless is incorrect. This suggests that the part of the answer discussing Pete's life being worthless should be removed or revised. The critique implies that the moral should focus on being thankful and not greedy without the negative interpretation about Pete's life. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the incorrect interpretation about Pete's life being worthless and focusing on the moral of thankfulness and avoiding greed.

John says yes, but the man tells him that he is going to be rich. The man then flashes a toothy smile at him and taps his phone twice. John's balance is updated to $247,349.43.

**Critique**: Mention that John wants to end the arrangement with the man, as well as John's daughter, these are major points in the story. Also, some of the wording provides the wrong context for the story. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests adding information about John wanting to end the arrangement with the man and mentioning John's daughter, which are described as major points in the story. However, it does not specify what the arrangement is or provide details about John's daughter, making it impossible to accurately incorporate these elements without referring back to the source material.

**Answer**: The protagonist is Daniel. He's described as a very careful, cold womanizer. He doesn't trust that the thing on the table isn't going to kill him because it is without form, a myriad of voices, and can be hostile. He relies on his guard for protection and also feels superiority because he wears the pants. His team of advisors sift through his files as if he has more power than necessary. Overall, he is never described in a heroic way, but it's tough to have a personification of evil when the depictions are flat black and white, and not from the narrator's perspective.

**Critique**: This does not appear in the text.

**Answer**: Sabara was a military officer and governor. He was appointed to the position of governor of Southeast Sulawesi in 1966. He was initially intended to serve just one term, but due to a lack of replacement candidates, he was extended for several months. He was appointed acting governor of Central Kalimantan in 1983. He was known by journalists as being the "acting governor specialist" in the early 1980s.

**Critique**: The answer given is off. It has nothing to do with the question asked. It should simply say the text says nothing about Sabara having dictatorial tendencies.

**Rationale**: The critique provides a clear directive on how to improve the answer by stating that the text does not mention anything about Sabara having dictatorial tendencies.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe a backstory for Squire Perry in 3-5 sentences based on character and context clues.

**Answer**: Perry is described as having incredibly low intelligence. He is the son of a knight, but it seems that no one could have predicted the extent of his incompetence. Given his circumstances, it's possible that Perry's shortcomings in intelligence and common sense may have been passed on genetically. Perry appears to be incapable of even common tasks such as wiping his own ass, this leads to a lot of resentment and frustration.

It seems that Perry was given a position of responsibility out of nepotism and nothing else. He lacks the intelligence necessary to hold the position in any meaningful, productive way. Even the menial duties he is tasked with, like organizing the equipment or fetching a horse, become incredibly tedious for him. This undoubtedly frustrates his superiors, driving them further towards anger and aggression. He likely does his best to avoid this and hates being judged by people who can do everything better and faster than he can.

**Critique**: This answer has confused the squire with his master. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer has mistakenly attributed characteristics of the master to Squire Perry. This implies that the backstory provided is incorrect because it is based on the wrong character. However, the critique does not provide any specific information about Squire Perry's actual backstory or characteristics. Without additional details about Squire Perry, it is not possible to correct or improve the answer solely based on the critique. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material.

Depression has changed his life for the better by helping him get the professional help that he needed and stopping him from making bad decisions such as abusing marijuana.

**Critique**: The narrator says committing suicide was both the worst and the best thing he's done. That's because it thought him to seek help.

However, they suddenly started feeling better after going to a hospital and having a diagnosis of psychosis. After this point, the narrator decided to quit smoking weed, restart their education, and stop procrastinating going to see psychs when they were experiencing symptoms of depression again.

**Critique**: The "suddenly felt better" doesn't mean the same thing in the answer as in the story. The story means it as a sort of relief at knowing what's wrong, and the narrator recovers with the help of his doctor.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the meaning of "suddenly felt better" in the story, indicating that it refers to a sense of relief from understanding their condition and recovering with the help of a doctor.

Summarize everything relating to Jonathan Demme's filmography.

**Answer**: Jonathan Demme directed Storefront Hitchcock. He presumably met Hitchcock after attending one of his live shows. After the show, Demme offered to direct a live performance video that became a full concert.

In the context of the article, Demme cast Hitchcock in two other films, The Manchurian Candidate and Rachel Getting Married, and he used one of his songs in The Truth About Charlie.

**Critique**: The response is incorrect and has nothing to do about Demme's filmography, which should have been Storefront Hitchcock, The Manchurian Candidate, Rachel Getting Married, The Truth About Charlie, Melvin And Howard, and Married to the Mob. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific films that should be included in the summary of Jonathan Demme's filmography. It lists the correct films that are relevant to Demme's work, allowing for a concrete improvement to the answer by including these films.

**Answer**: Hitchcock is a singer-songwriter. He has a rich, supple voice and his songs are the real attraction of the film. He has a large personal catalog. The songs in the film are from his latest album.

**Critique**: There was no mention of Hitchcock's latest album anywhere in the text. This part should be removed. 

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the mention of Hitchcock's latest album is incorrect and should be removed. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by eliminating the inaccurate information about the latest album. Therefore, I can make a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the sentence about the latest album without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: The first seven chapters of the book are suitable for an undergraduate, but as a whole the book is best suited for graduate students. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that implies which parts of the book exceed the abilities of a novice. It states that the first seven chapters are suitable for undergraduates, while the entire book is best suited for graduate students. This implies that chapters beyond the first seven exceed the abilities of a novice. Therefore, I can improve the answer by stating that chapters beyond the first seven are the ones that exceed novice abilities.

The author also believes that Trump is not very good at hiding his private views from the public. The author believes that Trump's private views are not very different from his public views. The author believes that Trump is a very authoritarian person.

**Critique**: Trump's public and private views and the author's thought that he's authoritarian are repeated in the answer.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer contains repetition regarding Trump's public and private views and the author's opinion that Trump is authoritarian. This implies that the answer can be improved by removing the redundant statements. Specifically, the repeated mention of Trump's public and private views being similar and the author's belief in Trump's authoritarian nature should be consolidated to avoid repetition. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by eliminating the redundant parts.

However, it does not provide specific details or context about this resentment, such as what he is resentful about or how it affects his staff's role.

**Critique**: It should be mentioned that the main point is to discuss the news of corruption in the Trump administration revealed by the president's lawyer.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the main point of the article is about the news of corruption in the Trump administration, as revealed by the president's lawyer. This provides a specific direction to improve the answer by focusing on the broader theme of corruption rather than just the specific incident of the payoff. Therefore, the critique gives enough information to adjust the focus of the answer to better capture the main point being discussed in the article.

**Critique**: This isn't an occupation. It would just be better to point out that the question is confusing, as the president's lawyer is already a lawyer.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer does not directly address the question of what specific occupation the president's lawyer must have, as it simply describes the skills or qualifications rather than naming an occupation. However, the critique does not provide an alternative occupation or suggest a specific improvement to the answer.

**Answer**: Lacie Burning's art is rooted in their experiences, cultural and political background, and identity as a Kanien'kehá:ka and Onöñda'gega Indigiqueer person. Burning's practice examines the relationship between settlers and Indigenous people and what it means for Indigenous peoples to assert their sovereignty over traditional land. The _Reflection Series_ is Burning's most notable work which explores this relationship from a Kanien'kehá:ka perspective. Burning has received awards and recognition for their work.

**Critique**: The last sentence is irrelevant to the answer

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the last sentence of the answer is irrelevant. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by removing the last sentence, which discusses awards and recognition.

What does the story say about the old homeless man?

**Answer**: The old man is addicted to heron and once lost his job as a news anchor. He has been homeless begging on the streets for 12 years since his wife left him for the best man of their wedding. The homeless man also has a dog he calls "the Fortune he once had and lost at a snap of a finger". He is days away from his katabasis (i.e. rock bottom). One day, the dog disappeared for months and just as he is about to give up reporting for good, it arrived as expected. The next time he saw it, a guy comes in to ask for the dog and the man reluctantly hands it to him. A few years later, more money in hand, he gets into rehab. A billionaire now, he lives in a 10-acre mansion and has a three-pool and a Jacuzzi. He then goes back to living in his old home, the alleyway where he used to be poor. One of the last lines of the story states that the homeless man "had lost the only true serenity he had in his life."

**Critique**: It is not stated when his wife left him. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the timing of when the man's wife left him is not stated. However, the current answer does not specify a particular time for this event, only that it happened before he became homeless.

What does the text say about the significance of the black labrador?

**Answer**: The homeless man needs the black lab to keep him company while his life fades into despair. The black lab reminds the narrator of his past and happiness. One day, the dog's new keeper stops and talks to him. The man stops to talk about the dog for a few minutes and tells the homeless man about Maverick, his black lab who he once had to let go in the woods. He tells the homeless man that the black lab is a symbol for everything he ever had, and the man wants to feel whole again. The homeless man sells the dog for $10,000, which, combined with the inheritance left by his late wife, helps him get clean and pay for a luxury rehab.

**Critique**: It is not stated that the man is the dog's new keeper.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a specific inaccuracy in the answer regarding the identity of the dog's new keeper.

What does the text say about the significance of the black labrador?

**Answer**: The old man befriends a black labrador during his stint as a homeless addict. The dog turns up at his side everytime he tries to get his life straight but eventually schedules to leave after he coughs blood into a palm. The dog looks like it could be the one he had when he was younger, who the man later lost. However, there is the pricey build-up that when the guy who bears a striking resemblance to the older man approaches and offers $1,000 (and $10,000) dollars for the dog, the old man holds his ground. The old man mulls it over and a decision is made for the dog to be sold only for the money. The man died in the process but the money enabled him to start over.

**Critique**: The answer is totally inaccurate.

What does the article say about Mulvaney's statements regarding the foreign aid to Ukraine?

**Answer**: Mulvaney claimed that the Trump administration withheld the aid from Ukraine in order to coerce the country into investigating a supposed Democratic National Committee email server and alleged "corruption" in the 2016 election ― not former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump's political rivals heading into 2020. Mulvaney said that Trump thought it was unfair that the European Union wasn't doing more to help Ukraine, prompting the U.S. to halt the aid.

### Sample 615/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about strangers?

**Answer**: The narrator believes that people are inherently good. He treats others as he would like to be treated. He always thanks and says "you're welcome". He has also learned to be considerate and think of others before himself. He also believes that if you teach someone manners, they will be more likely to use them. It seems that the narrator has noticed that people are less caring as he ages.

**Critique**: The highlighted sentence misconstrues a statement the narrator makes. The passage states that the narrator has heard that society has changed and that people are less caring, but it is not stated whether or not the narrator believes in this statement.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the highlighted sentence misrepresents the narrator's belief about society's change in caring nature. It clarifies that the passage only mentions the narrator has heard about this societal change, without confirming the narrator's belief in it. This allows for a concrete improvement: remove or modify the sentence to reflect that the narrator has only heard about the change, rather than personally noticing it.

Later, he commanded units within the Hasanuddin Military Region before serving as Governor of Southeast Sulawesi. Sabara also served as acting governor in several provinces due to his post in the Ministry of Home Affairs.

**Critique**: His tenure as governer is not relevant to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the information about Sabara's tenure as governor is not relevant to summarizing his military duties. This implies that the part of the answer discussing his role as governor should be removed to improve the focus on his military duties.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about amateur dental work?

**Answer**: Amateur dentists take pride in their work, given the rarity of people who talk about their surgical hobbies. They have to act solo to avoid being found out. Novocain cannot be bought off the shelf, so they either take a pile of pain killers or "go clean" without taking anything to prepare. They are bound to make mistakes, which may lead to gruesome diseases.

**Critique**: "They" seems to be referring to amateur dentists. The painkillers are for to the patients, not the dentists. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the incorrect attribution of painkiller use in the answer. It clarifies that the painkillers are meant for the patients, not the amateur dentists. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the attribution of painkiller use.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarise what significant incident occurred at work while Hunter skeptically assumed his night duty.

**Answer**: Hunter was on his way to another graveyard shift of monitoring the Distant Detection Array. He expressed his disinterest for his assignment to the attending officer as he always does. He thinks his job is a waste of time and resources. He is dressed in full uniform, has to have a special security clearance and works in a secret area of a heavily guarded military facility. He was prepared for another uneventful night of watching nothing happen on the monitors.

At 1:07 pm, some of the sensors started to detect something in a pocket of seemingly empty space about 17 light years away. One sensor detects an emission of gamma rays, another one detected x rays. This caught Hunter's attention as it is unusual for an area of empty space to emit such radiation. Hunter decided to take a look at the area with telescopes. He sent instructions an an infrared, visible light, and a radio telescope to survey the area. He was perplexed that both of them showed absolutely nothing even though the radiation levels were reaching levels that were theorized to be the upper limit of what the most powerful stars could emit. Because the telescopes couldn't see anything, Hunter was looking at data that told him a massive amount of radiation was either appearing out of nothing, or leaking into our universe. Hunter decoded that he would restart the sensors and receiving satellites to try and make sure these weren't false readings.

As he was waiting for the sensors to come back on, the infrared telescope he pointed at the area gave an alert. It had detected a momentary spike and drop to normal of heat in the area, which did not match the ever increasing readings from the other sensors. Hunter hoped the sensors would come back on, show nothing, and he could submit a simple sensor anomaly report to his superiors. These hopes were crushed when the sensors started returning information again. Not only did they pick up the radiation again, they were maxed out. Hunter couldn't believe it. He stared in awe, unable to come up with any explanation for what was going on in front of his eyes. Moments later, all the telescopes started giving alerts. The visible light telescope detected light levels akin to a supernova 100 light years away. The radio telescope was showing what could best be described as trying to broadcast every radio station from one antenna. The infrared telescope was telling him that this area of space, empty a few minutes ago, was engulfed in flames.

Then it all stopped. Everything observing the anomaly stopped transmitting data. Hunter thought it was an issue with the receiving satellites, however a check revealed they were functioning properly. He tried restarting the sensors and telescopes, but simply could not get any data from them. Hunter decided this was unusual enough to report to the officers and senior scientists at the base.

He called an emergency meeting, having to wake up generals, astronomers, and physicists in the middle of the night. He thought that his news wouldn't be well received at such a time, however his training told him to go through with the protocol right away. After everyone had been assembled and lots of coffee had been consumed, hunter began to present the data and his recollection of the events. He was surprised as the others began to look horrified.

One of the generals pointed at Hunter and said "Just to be clear son, you can never tell anyone outside this room what you just told us". He then excused hunter from his post, and told him that he would file his honorable discharge papers immediately if Hunter wished to leave the force. "Did I just detect something from out of this world?" Hunter asked the general, to which one of the physicists replied in a solemn tone "Out of this universe".

**Critique**: This is a copy of a large chunk of the story. It needs to be summarized.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer is too lengthy and needs to be summarized. While it doesn't provide specific details on how to summarize, it implies that the answer should be more concise. Using the critique, I can improve the answer by condensing the information to focus on the key incident: Hunter detected unusual radiation from a seemingly empty space, leading to an emergency meeting where it was implied that the phenomenon was of significant and possibly otherworldly importance. This approach aligns with the critique's request for a summary.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the double plot twist. 

**Answer**: The double plot twist occurs in quick succession. The narrator passes a strange birthday party with a coworker at the husband's disappearing. Melissa, the coworker, reassures her and mentions her taste in birthday cakes. Then Sharon remembers the chocolate cheesecake that her unfaithful husband brought to her in secrecy. She knows then that he is the man with whom she had the affair that cost him his life. Sharon doesn't want Mike to die, so she tries to warn him that the cake is poisoned. Mike doesn't want to lose her, so he tries to swallow it all when he realizes that Sharon has not eaten any of the cake. He dies a most painful death after laying his body on top of his wife for about an hour in a bloodbath.

**Critique**: - Sharon never spoke with Melissa about cakes, at least before Mike's death.
- Mike never brought Sharon a chocolate cheesecake in secret.
- Sharon never warned Mike that the cake is poisoned; the cake was not poisoned.
- Mike did not like on top of Sharon for an hour.
- Some of the sentences, like the second and fifth, make little sense in the whole context of the response.


**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections to the current answer, indicating which parts of the narrative are incorrect. It specifies that Sharon never spoke with Melissa about cakes, Mike never brought a chocolate cheesecake in secret, Sharon never warned Mike about a poisoned cake, and Mike did not lie on top of Sharon for an hour. Additionally, it points out that some sentences make little sense in the context.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about Beverly Duan being born in China is incorrect and provides the correct information that she was born in California. However, the critique does not address the main question of why she donated to charity in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Without additional information on her motivations, which the critique does not provide, I cannot improve the answer to address the "why" aspect. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to understand her reasons for donating.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why did Beverly Duan donate to charity in China during the COVID-19 pandemic?

**Answer**: She probably donated because thousands of people in China were affected by the pandemic.

**Critique**: The response misses to mention that Duan believes we can all find ways to give back to our community and make the world a better place. Also, that she believes people “can change the world when we work united"

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about Beverly Duan's beliefs and motivations for donating, which can be directly incorporated into the answer. It mentions her belief in giving back to the community and the power of unity in making a difference. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by including these motivations without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: There is no evidence to suggest that the reason she donated was to prevent the pandemic from spreading.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the stated reason for Beverly Duan's donation is not supported by evidence. However, it does not provide an alternative reason or any information that would allow for a concrete improvement to the answer.

What is the significance of Brown's work?

**Answer**: He has worked on seven consecutive United States Censuses, from the 18th in 1960 to the 24th in 2020.

**Critique**: The answer doesn't directly answer the question. There is a difference between what Brown's work constituted and the importance of his job. This should be corrected.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the current answer does not address the significance of Brown's work, only what he did. However, it does not provide any information or implications about what the significance might be. Without additional details or context about the importance of Brown's work, it is not possible to improve the answer solely based on the critique.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Brown's roles with the Census Bureau.

**Answer**: He worked for the Census Bureau as a temporary employee in 1960. He returned to work on the U.S. census every ten years thereafter. He held a variety of temporary positions with the Census Bureau including as a partnership assistant, crew leader, field manager and office supervisor. He served as a supply and recruiting clerk during the 24th United States Census in 2020.

**Critique**: - The answer omitted that Brown worked as an Enumerator with the United States Census Bureau as a temporary employee.

- It also omitted that on the every-ten-year census, Brown also assisted with the 1995 field test done in preparation for the 22nd United States Census in 2000.

- It omitted that Brown has worked on seven consecutive United States Censuses. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the current answer to improve it. It mentions that Brown worked as an Enumerator, assisted with the 1995 field test, and worked on seven consecutive censuses. These details can be incorporated into the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Mike's relationship with Sharon?

**Answer**: Sharon and Mike are friends who are trying to be mates, but the chemistry between them hasn't manifested into anything physical. Since they had great chemistry through texting, Mike invites Sharon over for a one night stand. Mike makes the whole room and hotel romantic in anticipation of Sharon but he's obsessed like a teenager.

**Critique**: He does not invite her over for a one night stand. he invites her over for drinks. This sentence should be changed to include both what he invites her over for, and what he actually desires. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what is incorrect in the answer and what needs to be included. It states that Mike does not invite Sharon over for a one night stand, but rather for drinks, and suggests that the sentence should reflect both the invitation and Mike's actual desires. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the part about the one night stand to drinks and adding a mention of Mike's desires.

**Answer**: The story suggests that Mike and Sharon share a strong rapport and clear chemistry between them. Mike is nervous and excited about the prospect of being with Sharon, but despite his reservations their connection is palpable.

**Critique**: The text should add that they are friends

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the answer to improve it. By stating that Mike and Sharon are friends, the critique implies that this detail should be included in the description of their relationship. Therefore, the answer can be improved by incorporating this information without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: Mike is expecting Sharon to visit him and is excited about that. They are trying to be friends, but Mike hopes that they got together the chemistry he so clearly felt. Sharon arrives and enters. Mike trips on her foot and clumsily stumbles forward pressing her against the corridor wall. For a moment, they look deep into each other’s eyes, then burst into a fit of laughter.

**Critique**: This sentence is worded poorly

**Rationale**: The critique "This sentence is worded poorly" does not specify which sentence is problematic or how it should be improved. Without knowing which sentence is poorly worded or receiving guidance on how to rephrase it, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique lacks the necessary information to revise the answer effectively without referring back to the source material.

Ultimately, when they are finally face to face, they both have a good time making fun of themselves and laughing together.

**Critique**: Re-word this sentence because it is awkward

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that a specific sentence in the answer is awkward and needs rewording. However, it does not specify which sentence is awkward or provide guidance on how to reword it. Without knowing which part of the answer is awkward or how to improve it, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything relating to violence.

**Answer**: This passage centers primarily around Will's relationship with his wife and two kids. One morning, his wife fails to appear and Will hears a snapping sound; at the same time, his wife arrives, and they argue. At sea, Terrance dies and Will is left alone. This last event affects Will; he starts to miss his kids and wife and starts dozing off. His wife dies, and in a final conclusion, all of this ends in violence.

**Critique**: There is only one instance of violence in the story.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that there is only one instance of violence in the story, which implies that the current answer incorrectly suggests multiple instances or a general theme of violence. Using this information, I can improve the answer by identifying and focusing on the single instance of violence mentioned in the critique. I would remove any references to multiple instances or a general conclusion of violence, as these are not supported by the critique.

Will hits the lamp, breaking it; Will hears a muffled sound and runs to investigate. Will can hear the blood bursting from his friend's veins as he grabs his neck, he was slumped there, head over the railing. Will is then sleepwalking.

**Critique**: The first sentence is the only part of the response that correctly follows the instruction.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that only the first sentence of the answer correctly follows the instruction to summarize everything relating to violence. This implies that the rest of the sentences do not pertain to violence or are not relevant to the summary of violence. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing all sentences except the first one, which is explicitly identified as correct by the critique.

**Answer**: The main character, Will, wakes up to screaming children for the third time that week. He discovers that his wife has not been around for a few days. Will becomes volatile, breaking a chair against the wall. The captain of Will's boat dies and then Will's wife also dies unexpectedly. Throughout it all, Will remains focused on getting away from all the tragedy. Upon waking from his nightmares, he realizes the gravity of what has happened and feels a sadness for his children and wife. Finally, he falls asleep on the boat and falls through the floor.

**Critique**: There is only one instance of violence in the story.

**Rationale**: The critique states that there is only one instance of violence in the story, which implies that the current answer includes more instances of violence than actually occur. However, the critique does not specify which part of the answer is the correct instance of violence. Without knowing which specific event is the true instance of violence, I cannot accurately revise the answer to reflect only that single instance. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to determine which part of the answer is correct.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything relating to violence.

**Answer**: Will mutters under his breath when he gets out of bed. He gets up after a few minutes, even though he feels out of sorts and scratches his morning stubble. When he hears a snapping sound from downstairs, he believes a chair he broke against the wall during an argument yesterday broke again. He mutters some things under his breath but then he is the one who leaves.

**Critique**: The only instance of violence in the story is when Will breaks the chair. The response even fails to cover this correctly since it states the event in the wrong context.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the instance of violence, stating that the only instance is when Will breaks the chair. It also points out that the current answer presents this event in the wrong context. With this information, I can improve the answer by focusing solely on the chair-breaking incident as the instance of violence and ensuring it is presented in the correct context. Therefore, I can write a better answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 681/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the type of relationship Will has with his wife.

**Answer**: He has significant tension with his wife, who he's had a long-term relationship with because she's been negligent on a consistent basis. Will is quite enraged at her for her negligence and seems to blame her for his PTSD. There has also been upheaval in their relationship and if it is defined as abusive, it could then be argued that Will is using both physical and verbal abuse to coerce his wife into doing something she doesn't want to do. She walks in at daybreak and deals with a four and six year old yet she is the one who is negligent on a consistent basis, while Will's family requires his attention. Thus, the burden she feels she has to bear is nowhere near as strenuous as Will's burden.

**Critique**: There is no mention of PTSD or abuse. Will does not coerce his wife. It is Will who deals with the children, not the wife.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections to the current answer, indicating that there is no mention of PTSD or abuse, that Will does not coerce his wife, and that it is Will who deals with the children, not the wife. These corrections allow for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the incorrect information about PTSD, abuse, and coercion, and by correcting the roles regarding who deals with the children. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it provides enough information to revise the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the type of relationship Will has with his wife.

**Answer**: Will wakes up as his wife is screaming at him and curses her. How they interacted over the years is not well depicted. Will develops a protective shield from his wife's dismal behaviour and hardly feels any strong emotions towards her. Society values law and order first before anything else. Will feels lucky to have two kids and an estranged wife.

**Critique**: A lot of the details in the response is contextually incorrect.

**Rationale**: The critique states that "a lot of the details in the response is contextually incorrect," but it does not specify which details are incorrect or provide any guidance on what the correct information might be. Without specific information on what is incorrect or what the correct context should be, it is impossible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material. The critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

Summarize the type of relationship Will has with his wife.

**Answer**: He and his wife have been married for fifteen years. He is not pleased to see his wife when she returns home. He gets angry when she shouts at him and he smashes a chair against the wall. 

**Critique**: The story implies that the relationship is strained on a much longer basis instead of having a single instance of a bad interaction.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the relationship between Will and his wife is consistently strained, rather than being characterized by a single negative interaction. This implies that the answer should reflect an ongoing pattern of tension or conflict in their relationship. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to improve the answer by emphasizing the long-term nature of the strain in their relationship.

What does the story say about the relationship Will has with his kids?

**Answer**: It appears Will loves his kids. He remembers how they were in the past and misses their youth. He likes retrieving most things they have on the floor. The shout from them, which is a childish action, made him forget about his parents and poked him to a place that is as good as heaven for him.

**Critique**: Will's relationship is not clearly defined in the story, but it can be somewhat inferred.

**Rationale**: The critique states that Will's relationship with his kids is not clearly defined in the story but can be somewhat inferred. This critique does not provide specific information or guidance on how to improve the answer. It does not suggest any concrete changes or corrections to the current answer, nor does it imply what specific aspects of the relationship should be highlighted or altered.

### Sample 685/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the relationship Will has with his kids?

**Answer**: Will appears to have a fairly antagonistic relationship with his kids. On occasion he catches one or both of them smoking, he seems fed up with parenting and wears his frustration openly on his face. What is interesting is that he rhetorically asks himself if he misses his kids and no answer was forthcoming. Over the course of the the story, Will tends to forget the kids exist but when he does think about them, he remembers he loves them no matter how traumatic parenting them can be.

**Critique**: It was not said that his relationship was antagonistic. The children are not shown to smoke. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts parts of the current answer. It states that the relationship is not described as antagonistic and that the children are not shown to smoke. This allows for concrete improvements to the answer by removing or correcting these inaccuracies. Specifically, the parts about the relationship being antagonistic and the children smoking should be revised or removed. However, the critique does not provide information on what the relationship actually is, so while it allows for the removal of incorrect information, it does not provide enough to fully improve the answer with a new description of the relationship.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the relationship Will has with his kids?

**Answer**: In the story, Will's relationship with his children is not great. He seems reluctant to spend time with them and yells at them when they start screaming in the morning. However, when the rest of his family dies and he is the only one left, he starts to miss them and wishes for their company. The story shows that a broken relationship can mend with time and family drama.

**Critique**: Will does not yell at anyone in the story.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It states that "Will does not yell at anyone in the story," which directly contradicts the current answer's claim that Will yells at his children. This allows for a concrete improvement: remove or correct the part about Will yelling at his children. The rest of the answer can remain as it is, as the critique does not address those parts.

**Critique**: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are all located in the Eurasian supercontinent - rephrase to reflect that these are not separate regions.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by suggesting a rephrasing to accurately reflect the geographical classification. It implies that the current answer incorrectly separates the countries from the Eurasian supercontinent, and the improvement involves integrating this information into a cohesive statement. Therefore, the critique allows for a concrete improvement without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: The answer could include the soils being rich in sodium ions and sulfate ions.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests adding specific information about the soil composition, namely that the soils are rich in sodium ions and sulfate ions. This provides enough detail to improve the answer by specifying the type of soil Bienertia cycloptera grows in, without needing to refer back to the source material. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it allows for a concrete improvement to the answer.

B. cycloptera has also been used in scientific research for agriculture for the changing of commercial crops from C3 to C4 photosynthetic plants.

**Critique**: Change "no" to "little scientific" evidence

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific instruction to change "no" to "little scientific" evidence. This is a clear directive that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique implies that there is some evidence, albeit limited, which can be reflected in the revised answer.

**Answer**: The students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where the Parkland shooting occurred, do not agree with the movie and video game industry, placing the blame on the inaction of inactive politicians and the National Rifle Association, demanding gun-control reform.

**Critique**: The first sentence of the answer should be rewritten because it says the students disagree with the movie and video game industry; meanwhile, the text does not indicate such. The model's answer changes the meaning from the text and is inaccurate and should consider correcting this.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the first sentence of the answer inaccurately states that the students disagree with the movie and video game industry, which is not indicated in the text. This implies that the sentence should be rewritten to remove the incorrect information about the students' disagreement with the movie and video game industry. The critique provides enough information to correct the inaccuracy by focusing on the students' actual stance, which involves blaming inactive politicians and the National Rifle Association and demanding gun-control reform. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it guides the necessary correction without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies that the first sentence is poorly structured but does not provide specific guidance on how to improve it. Without additional information or suggestions on how to restructure the sentence, it is not possible to make a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique does not imply a specific correction or provide enough information to rewrite the sentence effectively without referring back to the source material.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the first part of the response is unnecessary, which implies that the sentence "Donald Trump has made the protests a key part of his appeal to his base" should be removed. This is a clear instruction that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: This fails to mention comments by Hillary Clinton, Lindsay Graham, Dick Durbin, Tom Cotton, David Purdue, and Steve King. 

**Rationale**: The critique identifies specific individuals whose comments are missing from the answer. However, it does not provide any information about what these individuals said. Without knowing their remarks, I cannot improve the answer to include their perspectives. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to find out what Hillary Clinton, Lindsay Graham, Dick Durbin, Tom Cotton, David Purdue, and Steve King said about Trump's remarks.

Trump allegedly said that Haiti is a very poor and troubled country. He has denied the remarks.

**Critique**: It is also alleged that Trump called African countries "shitholes" multiple times. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides additional specific information about Trump's alleged remarks, specifically that he called African countries "shitholes" multiple times. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding this specific allegation to the summary of Trump's remarks.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about privacy?

**Answer**: The Albrecht family obsesses over privacy. They have always lived behind fortress-like security on estates in what is assumed to be the Ruhr Valley. Rarely are they captured by paparazzi. They made all deaths public information, but private wealth? They dodge public records on how large Aldi stores are. Theo does not want to save future prices for his company for large investors, saying only "do what you want; we don't ask for demonstrations. Send us an invoice." The brothers run their operations with military discipline and with vigilance for detail, often being led in secrecy about the operations of their stores.  The brothers and their relatives follow stringent schedules and duties daily, never making themselves public whether it be as owners of a public company or to build stores.

**Critique**: One of the sentences is awkward in that it ends in a question mark-presumably for the reader-which lends an odd and inaccurate feeling of familiarity to a summary. Summaries are supposed to be more clinical and topical. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that one of the sentences in the answer ends with a question mark, which is inappropriate for a summary. This implies that the sentence should be rephrased to remove the question mark and maintain a more clinical tone. The critique provides enough information to make this specific change without needing to refer back to the source material. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it allows for a concrete improvement to the answer.

While it suggests a structural change, it does not offer enough information to improve the content of the answer itself. Without additional context or specific instructions on how to rephrase the answer into a full sentence, the critique does not enable a concrete improvement.

What does the brute mean when he says he "was just trying to get [back to being] the man he was supposed to be"?

**Answer**: [rewrite]

**Critique**: The story explicitly talks about why the narrator wants to go back to being like he was in the past. The answer should tell that.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the story provides explicit reasons for why the narrator wants to return to a previous state. However, it does not specify what those reasons are.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How do we come to find out Mordid has been engineering this scheme and manipulating the brute for a very long time?

**Answer**: The brute is given back his memories and he realizes that Mordid had been the one who had turned him into an ogre.

**Critique**: The brute never finds out Mordid's complicity in his predicament. We are told in the story about Mordid's thoughts, which is how we learn.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts the current answer. It states that the brute never finds out about Mordid's involvement, and instead, the story reveals Mordid's complicity through his thoughts. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the incorrect part about the brute realizing Mordid's role and instead focusing on how the story reveals Mordid's thoughts. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it provides enough information to correct the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: - The response did not take into account that the narrator has an idea of what is happening with her friend.

- Also, the response does not account for the narrator's feelings, which was the essence of the question.

- The word "they" is not needed here.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific feedback that can be used to improve the answer.

The friends drift apart after high school and the narrator feels sad to not be able to do anything about it. In the end, the narrator expresses that she wants to help her friend but is pushed away by her.

**Critique**: - The response seems incomplete in that it did not express why the narrator is being "pushed away" by her friend.
- The response does not fully address the range of emotions felt by the narrator.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the response is incomplete because it does not explain why the narrator is being "pushed away" by her friend and does not fully address the range of emotions felt by the narrator. However, it does not provide specific information or suggestions on what additional emotions should be included or why the friend is pushing the narrator away.

Summarize the feelings the narrator has toward her friend. 

**Answer**: The narrator is worried about her friend. The narrator feels more aloof from her friend than ever and seems to ping pong between being annoyed with her to being upset at her. The narrator also was jealous of her friend at one point. The narrator felt very sad to see her friend everyday and feel like she barely knew her. 

**Critique**: - The word "aloof" does not seem to fit any emotions felt by the narrator towards her friend.
- There was no indication in the passage that the narrator was at anytime jealous of her friend.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific feedback on two parts of the answer: the use of the word "aloof" and the mention of jealousy. It indicates that "aloof" does not fit the emotions described and that there is no indication of jealousy in the passage. Based on this critique, I can improve the answer by removing the word "aloof" and the mention of jealousy, as these elements are not supported by the passage. The critique allows for a concrete improvement without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the feelings the narrator has toward her friend. 

**Answer**: The narrator feels sadness and worry in regards to her friend. She is sad to see her friend changing while also understanding why she is changing. The narrator also feels some resentment. She wishes she could do more to help her friend and that her friend would open up to her.

**Critique**: - While the narrator was sad to see what her friend was going through, there is an assumption in the passage that her friend has always been that way.

- I do not see any sign of resentment on the part of the narrator.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific feedback that can be used to improve the answer. It indicates that the assumption about the friend changing may not be accurate, suggesting that the narrator's sadness is not about change but rather about the friend's consistent state. Additionally, the critique clearly states that there is no sign of resentment from the narrator, which implies that the part of the answer mentioning resentment should be removed. These points allow for concrete improvements to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe how the narrator's friend felt about her boyfriend. 

**Answer**: The narrator's friend becomes infatuated with a boy she has just met. She disregards any problems with him and chooses to see only what she wants to see. She falls hard and fast for him, even when he does something behind her back and she's upset. Her single-minded focus on her boyfriend seems desperate-- she is searching frantically for something and only willing to accept it when it comes with an attachment. Her boyfriend becomes the only thing she can rely on even though he is not giving her any answers.

**Critique**: - There is no evidence in the passage that shows that the narrator's friend only clings or relies on her boyfriend.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that there is no evidence in the passage to support the claim that the narrator's friend clings or relies on her boyfriend. This suggests that the part of the answer stating "Her boyfriend becomes the only thing she can rely on" should be removed or revised.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the later part of the response is not needed, which implies that the information about the boyfriend giving the narrator's friend her first shot of drugs should be removed.

### Sample 711/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe how the narrator's friend felt about her boyfriend. 

**Answer**: She did not have many friends because she would throw herself into being with her boyfriend, believing that he would take care of her. When he acted unreasonably, she would disregard him. The boy did not care for her blindly and refused to help her. He did not put in much effort to ensure that they could be together.

**Critique**: - There is no indication in the passage that the narrator's friend has few friends because of her boyfriend.

- The narrator's friend never disregarded her boyfriend for any reason.

- There are no examples or references in the passage of the boyfriend refusing to help out the narrator's friend.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific points that indicate inaccuracies in the current answer. It states that there is no evidence in the passage for the narrator's friend having few friends due to her boyfriend, disregarding her boyfriend, or the boyfriend refusing to help her. However, the critique does not provide any information on how the narrator's friend actually felt about her boyfriend.

**Critique**: The broadcasting of the documentary is not relevant to its production, which is what the question asks about. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the mention of the documentary's broadcasting is not relevant to the question, which asks about the production of the documentary.

**Answer**: The narrator is estranged from his wife, who is crazy. He has a young son, Wayne, and they take a trip to the old amusement park, Zulu. The narrator tells Wayne about how he used to come to Zulu as a teenager, and they come to the park and walk around. The narrator suggests go-karts, and Wayne agrees. The park hasn't changed since his teenage years, and the narrator reminisces about his younger days there.

**Critique**: The response uses the word "narrator" to denote the main character. However, the passage is written in third person and the protagonist is given a name, Virgil. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It indicates that the main character is named Virgil and that the story is written in the third person.

**Answer**: Virgil takes his 10 year old son, Wayne, to the local amusement park called Zulu to recapture his own younger days. Virgil used to go there to buy weight and sell dimebags. Wayne is more interested in what Zulu actually means. Virgil talks about being a seller when he was younger and having his fair share of trouble with the cops. The trip is a success as Virgil realize he may have a real liking for his son.

**Critique**: The response contains several inaccuracies. Wayne does not ask about what Zulu means, and Virgil does not talk about his drug dealing. 

**Rationale**: The critique identifies specific inaccuracies in the answer, namely that Wayne does not ask about what Zulu means, and Virgil does not talk about his drug dealing. However, it does not provide the correct information or suggest what should be included instead. Without knowing what actually happens in the story, I cannot improve the answer.

**Answer**: The story is about Virgil and his son Wayne, who are visiting the rundown amusement park called Zulu. While walking the market street of the park, Virgil tells Wayne about how he used to come to the park as a teen, but does not persuade the boy to ride any of the rides. Finally, Virgil persuades Wayne to try the go-karts instead. Virgil explains that in his past, Zulu was where he used to hang out and admits that the park hasn't changed since then.

**Critique**: The response should say that the Virgil is unable to convince Wayne to ride any of the rides, not that he didn't try at all. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that Virgil did attempt to persuade Wayne to ride the rides, but was unsuccessful. This allows the editor to revise the sentence to accurately reflect Virgil's efforts.

**Answer**: Virgil and his son Wayne pass by a dilapidated sign bearing the words Zulu. Curious of what Zulu is, Wayne asks Virgil, who tells him it is an amusement park. Virgil proceeds to explain a little about himself and the life he had in the ghettos. He used to buy illicit drugs and sell them to suburbanites from Fort Worth from the park. Wayne is a bright child who can comprehend things well. Wayne gets excited when Virgil tells him he'll go on a few rides but only a go-kart ride. Virgil buys him a go-kart ticket despite the fact that it is meant for an adult. Zulu looks like a place defined by neglect in Virgil's eyes, he can only compare it to the very things he truly loved in the ghettos in his misspent youth.

**Critique**: The response takes several pieces of the exposition of the story and internal dialogue as plot points, which is inaccurate. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer incorrectly includes exposition and internal dialogue as plot points, but it does not specify which parts of the answer are exposition or internal dialogue versus actual plot points.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Virgil's relationship with the Zulu amusement park.

**Answer**: Virgil used to spend time at Zulu when he was a teen; but now, as an adult, he appreciates the park more for its kitsch value than anything else. Virgil generally only goes to Zulu to wander around and spend time with his son, and on occasion, to ride go-karts with him. He does not believe Zulu to have any actual appeal as an amusement park.

**Critique**: The passage does not say that Virgil appreciates Zulu for the kitsch value. He appreciates it for the nostalgia that it brings him. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It states that Virgil appreciates Zulu for the nostalgia it brings him, not for its kitsch value. This allows the editor to revise the answer by replacing the incorrect reason for Virgil's appreciation of the park with the correct one, as specified in the critique.

**Critique**: The response is incorrect about the ages of both Virgil and Wayne. Virgil is 35, and Wayne's age is not mentioned in the passage. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections regarding the ages of Virgil and Wayne. It states that Virgil is 35, and it clarifies that Wayne's age is not mentioned in the passage. With this information, I can improve the answer by correcting Virgil's age to 35 and removing the specific age of Wayne since it is not provided.

Wayne's mother always argued with Virgil and made matters complicated. Virgil moved on to another lady and Wayne's mother became jealous. Wayne's mother even punched Virgil's new lover out of jealousy. Things got even worse when Wayne's mom had an assault charge filed against her because of it. Virgil ended up having to call the police on Wayne's mom and was constantly arguing with Wayne's mom. Virgil was finally able to move on from Wayne's mom after custody papers were signed.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Virgil's relationship with Wayne's mother.

**Answer**: Virgil used to be married to Wayne's mother, but they have since separated. She was very smart, but also short tempered according to Virgil. Virgil and Wayne's mother still must have a decent relationship since Virgil is allowed to keep seeing and taking care of Wayne.

**Critique**: The last sentence should include a qualifier for the statement, as it is not explicitly stated in the passage that Virgil and Wayne's mother are on good terms. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the last sentence of the answer should include a qualifier because the passage does not explicitly state that Virgil and Wayne's mother are on good terms. This implies that the statement about their relationship should be more tentative or cautious. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by adding a qualifier such as "it seems" or "it appears" to indicate that the conclusion about their relationship is inferred rather than directly stated.

Summarize Virgil's relationship with Wayne.

**Answer**: Virgil has a strong positive relationship with his youngest son, Wayne. He goes out of his way to spend time with him and often suggests fun things to do. The two currently enjoy going to Zulu amusement park together and riding go-karts.

**Critique**: The response should include that although it is in poor taste to pick favorites among one's children, Virgil favors Wayne the most. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the current answer to improve it. It suggests including the detail that Virgil favors Wayne the most, despite it being in poor taste to pick favorites among one's children. This additional information can be incorporated into the summary without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 732/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Virgil's relationship with Wayne.

**Answer**: Virgil treated Wayne differently than his other children largely because he was his only son. He also seemed to find himself happier in Wayne's company. The passage references a time when Virgil would go out of his way to pick up Wayne.

**Critique**: The passage does not explicitly state that Virgil only has one son. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the passage does not explicitly state that Virgil only has one son. This implies that the statement "because he was his only son" in the answer is incorrect or unconfirmed. Therefore, the answer can be improved by removing or modifying this part of the sentence. The rest of the answer can remain as it is, as the critique does not challenge any other part of the answer. Thus, the critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Virgil's relationship with Wayne.

**Answer**: Virgil's relationship with Wayne seems to be very good. He finds the time to spend with Wayne occasionally. Virgil takes Wayne to Zulu to relive the time that he used to come there pretty much every night when he was a teen. Accordingly, Virgil seems interested in sharing activities with Wayne

**Critique**: The passage states that Virgil will go out of his way to spend more time with Wayne, making the highlighted sentence inaccurate. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts the current answer, indicating that Virgil is willing to go out of his way to spend more time with Wayne. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the inaccurate part about Virgil only finding time occasionally. The improved answer can emphasize Virgil's commitment to spending more time with Wayne, as suggested by the critique.

**Critique**: There's no specific answer, so it would be better to leave it at that.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the current answer does not specifically address the question about the skills needed to become a Russian pop star. However, it does not provide any information or implications on what should be included to improve the answer. The critique merely states that the answer is non-specific and implies that it should remain as such, without offering any guidance on how to make it more specific or relevant to the question. Therefore, without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to improve the answer based on the critique alone.

**Critique**: IT should be included that Napoli is also an artist.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests including that Zaza Napoli is also an artist, which is already implied in the answer by mentioning that Napoli pursued a career in music and art. However, the critique does not provide specific new information or details about Napoli's career as an artist that are not already covered. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material for additional details about Napoli's artistic career.

He received several awards including "Night Life Awards" and "Silver Galosh", and released three albums in 2016 - 2017.

**Critique**: These pertain to Napoli's early life and academic career, not overall career.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the current answer focuses on Zaza Napoli's early life and academic career rather than his overall career. However, it does not provide specific information or guidance on what aspects of his overall career should be included or emphasized. Without additional details or direction, I cannot improve the answer to better reflect Zaza Napoli's overall career without referring back to the source material.

How does Marko's opinions change about being a pet through the story?

**Answer**: At first, he was awe-struck about the human world, imagining all of the new experiences he could have with humans as pets. Then he started to fell sad as he grew to get acquainted with humans knowing nothing of him, like noticing noses and eyeglasses. At the end of the story, he is just hurt and dazed.

**Critique**: Everything after the first sentence is misleading/inaccurate

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that everything after the first sentence is misleading or inaccurate, but it does not provide any information on what the correct details should be. Without knowing what is accurate about Marko's changing opinions, I cannot improve the answer. The critique fails to provide enough information to make a concrete improvement without referring back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How does Marko's opinions change about being a pet through the story?

**Answer**: As the story progresses, Marko's opinion on being a pet shifts from hesitant curiosity to horror. At first, he is awed and curious at the human world, but is quickly convinced by the human girl and mother that it would not be a good choice. He is eventually caught by the humans and placed inside a dark box where he cannot escape. As he remains trapped, his view of the humans turns negative and emotional. He begins to see their actions as careless and neglectful. He no longer desires the experiences of being a pet, and now is solely focused on returning to his mother and litter of kittens.

**Critique**: "He begins to see their actions as careless and neglectful" is not supported

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement "He begins to see their actions as careless and neglectful" is not supported. However, it does not provide any information on what Marko's actual perception of the humans is, if not careless and neglectful. Without additional information or an alternative perspective provided by the critique, I cannot improve the answer. I would need to refer back to the source material to understand how Marko's perception of the humans is portrayed if it is not as described.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How does Marko's opinions change about being a pet through the story?

**Answer**: At the beginning of the story, Marko wants to be street life like his mother. However, his experience as a pet alters his opinions. He is frightened by being taken by the humans and put into a dark box, and, he becomes emotionally traumatized. Marko begins to see the negative aspects of being a pet, how he is controlled and trapped. One the other hand, he also glimpses the attractions of being a pet, like being closer to humans and experiencing their world. In the end, Marko has dramatically changed his opinion of being a pet. Now he realizes how frightening it is and would much rather stay where he is safe with his family.

**Critique**: "wants to be street life" is neither grammatical nor accurate

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the phrase "wants to be street life" is neither grammatical nor accurate. This implies that the phrase should be corrected to something that is both grammatically correct and accurately reflects Marko's initial opinion about being a pet. While the critique does not provide the exact wording, it suggests that Marko's initial desire is related to street life, possibly wanting to live like a street animal or be free like his mother. Therefore, the editor can improve the answer by rephrasing this part to something like "At the beginning of the story, Marko wants to live a street life like his mother." This correction is based on the implication of the critique without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How does Marko's opinions change about being a pet through the story?

**Answer**: Marko's original inclination is to only want to be in the house with humans while continuing his free life as a cat. This changes when he sees firsthand, from the eyes of a human, all the neat things that could be done if he were a human. From this, he longs for being a human.

**Critique**: Completely inaccurate response

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response is "completely inaccurate," but it does not provide any information or implications about what the accurate response should be. Without additional details or guidance on what Marko's opinions actually are, it is impossible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material. The critique fails to offer any constructive direction or specific corrections that could be made to the answer.

Why does Still Woozy (Gamsky) release his music as soon as possible?

**Answer**: Gamsky prefers to release music as soon as possible so that his fans have the most up-to-date work. This allows him to connect with his fans on an immediate basis.

**Critique**: While this is a good interpretation, it should be stated that it is an interpretation and not a stated fact. There are no given reasons in the article.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer is an interpretation rather than a stated fact from the source material. However, it does not provide any specific information or alternative interpretation that could be used to improve the answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why does Still Woozy (Gamsky) release his music as soon as possible?

**Answer**: Sven Gamsky is an American singer-songwriter performing under the stage name of Still Woozy. Gamsky started recording his own music at the age of 13, playing guitar for "Shoot for Roots", a band he created with his classmates.  After high school Gamsky taught guitar lessons for money and also played with a band called Feed Me Jack from 2011 to 2016. 

In 2016, Gamsky and the band split up to pursue individual music careers. After the split, Gamsky styled himself as Still Woozy and started making records under that name. 

Gamsky is known to releasing his records as soon as he makes them. The reason for this might be tied to his stage name, Still Woozy, a name he recalled choosing because of his spaced-out nature. This might have a hand in not wanting to hold on to newly-released works for too long, releasing them so he can work on other stuff.

**Critique**: The response does not address the question at all.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response does not address the question, which is about why Still Woozy releases his music as soon as possible. However, the critique does not provide any information or suggestions on what the correct answer might be. It simply points out that the current answer is inadequate. Without additional information or guidance on what the correct reasoning or details are, I cannot improve the answer. I would need to refer back to the source material to understand the actual reason behind Still Woozy's quick release of music.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why does Still Woozy (Gamsky) release his music as soon as possible?

**Answer**: Gamsky prefers releasing his music as soon as possible since this aligns with his preference for spontaneity. He prefers releasing songs on the same day he finishes producing them. Gamsky prefers releasing music quickly in order to generate feedback more quickly.

**Critique**: While this is a good interpretation, it should be stated that it is an interpretation and not a stated fact. There are no given reasons in the article.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the reasons provided in the answer are interpretations rather than stated facts from the source material. However, it does not provide any specific information or alternative phrasing to improve the answer. It simply suggests that the answer should clarify that these are interpretations. Without additional information from the source, it is not possible to concretely improve the answer to reflect this distinction.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is the purpose of the U.S red flag list?

**Answer**: The U.S. created a list of Chinese companies and research organizations who were believed to support the Chinese military. The list was published on April 11th. The companies on the list were required to have tighter control mechanisms in place that are compliant with registration requirement.

**Critique**: The list wasn't just for Chinese companies as there were other countries on the list. It was also never mentioned whether the companies supported the Chinese military. The tighter control mechanisms and registration requirements were not for the "unverified" companies on the list, but for U.S. companies like Applied Materials that have business deals with these unverified companies. The response needs a rewrite. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the list includes companies from countries other than China, that the companies were not specifically noted for supporting the Chinese military, and that the tighter control mechanisms and registration requirements apply to U.S. companies dealing with the unverified companies, not the unverified companies themselves. This information allows for a rewrite of the answer to accurately reflect the purpose of the U.S. red flag list without needing to refer back to the source material.

What is the purpose of the U.S red flag list?

**Answer**: The purpose of the U.S red flag list is to require U.S. suppliers not to make deliveries to or provide service for anyone on the list. The list is meant to caution American companies to treat persons on the list with caution.

**Critique**: The U.S. red flag list wasn't meant to stop deliveries of goods and services per se. Business deals stopped because companies couldn't use their existing licenses anymore and needed to apply for new ones. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the purpose of the U.S. red flag list, indicating that it is not about stopping deliveries directly but about the need for companies to apply for new licenses. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by clarifying the actual impact of the list on business deals.

**Answer**: The China Commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng blamed the new U.S. move could harm Chinese companies' reputation and disrupt normal trade activities.

**Critique**: The response is inaccurate and irrelevant because Gao Feng has nothing to do with the Chinese company (San'an Optoelectronics) mentioned in the article. The company made no comment and the response should either be "No answer/response" or that the company's feelings are not known because they did not comment on the matter.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to correct the answer by indicating that the current response is inaccurate and irrelevant. It suggests that the correct response should either be "No answer/response" or that the company's feelings are not known because they did not comment on the matter.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the main news event.

**Answer**: Larry Sharpe has raised more contributions for governor than any other declared candidate. He plans to present himself as an alternative to voters who dislike Gov. Andrew Cuomo and believes his chances of winning are good, due to Cuomo's lackluster social media support and poor debating skills. If Sharpe wins the Libertarian Party's state convention and crosses the 50,000-vote threshold, the party will have automatic ballot access in New York.

**Critique**: Cuomo received more

**Rationale**: The critique states "Cuomo received more," which implies that the statement about Larry Sharpe raising more contributions than any other declared candidate is incorrect. However, the critique does not provide the correct information or specify what Cuomo received more of (e.g., contributions, votes, support). Without this specific information, I cannot improve the answer to accurately reflect the main news event.

**Critique**: The story is actually about the libertarian candidate.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the main news event is not about Governor Cuomo or the Republicans, but rather about the libertarian candidate. However, it does not provide any specific details about the libertarian candidate or what the main news event concerning them is.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the main news event.

**Answer**: Larry Sharpe, a Libertarian candidate for Governor, raised $102,596 in contributions during the most recent filing period. This puts him far ahead of other declared candidates. Sharpe believes he has an advantage because he is not a Republican, and expects to gain significant statewide support. He will need to win the Libertarian Party's state convention in order to be on the ballot, although he does not expect this to be a roadblock. Sharpe believes he can beat incumbent Governor Andrew Cuomo in debates and other aspects of campaigning. However, he also recognizes that it will still be a tough battle. Despite this, Sharpe remains optimistic that he can overcome long odds and win the Governor's race.

**Critique**: Except for Governor Cuomo

**Rationale**: The critique "Except for Governor Cuomo" suggests that the statement "This puts him far ahead of other declared candidates" is incorrect because it does not account for Governor Cuomo. The critique implies that while Larry Sharpe may be ahead of other candidates, he is not ahead of Governor Cuomo. Therefore, the answer can be improved by clarifying that Sharpe is ahead of other candidates except for Governor Cuomo. This can be done without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides enough information to make this specific correction.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the main news event.

**Answer**: The Republican party is looking at something of an revamp-if not overhaul-in the politician who came second place in raising contributions this year [as of the time of this article]. Larry Sharp, running on the Libertarian ticket, is seen as a contender to the candidates in both majority parties. He maintains that he is getting ahead because New Yorkers know that the Republican vote is a "wasted vote",and many more conservative voters may be looking to new ways to reinvigorate the political landscape in accordance with their evolving values as the world continues to change dramatically at a faster-than-ever pace. Sharpe may prove to be a viable gubernatorial candidate.

**Critique**: Technically this sentence is grammatically correct but it is needlessly complicated and very hard to read.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the sentence is grammatically correct but difficult to read due to its complexity. While it doesn't provide specific instructions on how to simplify the sentence, it implies that the sentence should be rewritten in a clearer and more straightforward manner. This suggestion allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by simplifying the language and structure to enhance readability.

Sharpe is the only declared Libertarian to date, 2016.

**Critique**: This does not capture the main new story, about Sharpe

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the main news event is about Sharpe, which is not adequately captured in the current answer. However, it does not provide specific information about what the main story regarding Sharpe is.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the typical turnout for Libertarian candidates and their place in the political lineup. 

**Answer**: Libertarians have never come close to getting the votes and endorsements to make it into a gubernatorial race, but Larry Sharpe has raised a whopping $102,596. His base generating these funds is mostly online, utilizing tools in social media to market him as "not the other guy". What is interesting is that typically the Libertarian party accounts for about one percent of the vote, but this year, Sharpe is coming in second only to the formidable Gov. Cuomo, whose wealth far surpasses all other contenders. Perhaps part of the reason for this third-party surge is that traditional media coverage doesn't have the leverage that it once held compared to more viral methods of communicating and attracting supporters. 

**Critique**: Information about how much money was raised is not relevant to this question

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the information about the amount of money raised is not relevant to the question about the typical turnout for Libertarian candidates and their place in the political lineup. This implies that the part of the answer discussing Larry Sharpe's fundraising should be removed. The critique provides enough information to make this specific change without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the typical turnout for Libertarian candidates and their place in the political lineup. 

**Answer**: There have been few Libertarian candidates running for governor in New York, but those who have run have typically had a visible online following and gained funding from outside the state. The party's typical grassroots support has been low overall though, with no candidates passing the 50,000 mark required for automatic ballot access. With this in mind, third-party candidates for governor typically have little chance to win, though Larry Sharpe believes he could win based on the size of his following and his perceived ability to win debates.

**Critique**: Remove the word "though"

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific instruction to remove the word "though" from the answer. This is a clear and actionable suggestion that can be implemented without needing to refer back to the source material. The removal of the word "though" is a concrete change that can be made directly to improve the clarity or flow of the answer.

**Critique**: This line needs more historical context than just one anecdote

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer lacks sufficient historical context by only providing an anecdote about Tom Golisano. However, it does not specify what additional historical context should be included or what other examples or data points would be relevant. Without specific guidance on what historical context is needed, it is not possible to improve the answer without consulting the source material to understand the broader historical turnout for Libertarian candidates and their place in the political lineup.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what this piece has to say about the larger context of voter demographics in the United States. 

**Answer**: The author of this passage has identified voter reluctance towards Republicans in New York as a major challenge in that state. It is also noted that Libertarians, led in fundraising by Larry Sharpe, have a much more realistic chance of surpassing the 50,000 vote threshold necessary to be classified as a legitimate party in New York State. Lastly, the author expects Sharpe to be competitive in various categories of campaigning, namely in debates with incumbent Andrew Cuomo. As a result, it can be inferred that voter demographics in the United States are generally unfavorable towards Republican candidates.

**Critique**: They are only unfavorable in New York, this should be libertarians

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about voter demographics being unfavorable towards Republicans is specific to New York, not the entire United States. It also suggests that the focus should be on Libertarians rather than Republicans. This implies that the answer should be revised to reflect that the unfavorable voter demographics are specific to New York and that the passage is more about the Libertarians' chances in New York. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to improve the answer by specifying the geographic limitation and shifting the focus to Libertarians.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what this piece has to say about the larger context of voter demographics in the United States. 

**Answer**: This is a national conversation and not limited to New York State. The author is genuinely baffled that New York State voters have not embraced Republicans and one Republican (Larry Sharpe) has serious plans for an uphill battle for Governor.

**Critique**: This line does not have any semantics which align with the piece. "Genuinely baffled" is a bizarre tone

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the phrase "genuinely baffled" does not align with the piece and describes the tone as "bizarre." However, it does not provide any specific guidance on what the correct tone or content should be. Without additional information or suggestions on what the correct tone or content should be, it is not possible to improve the answer. The critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement without referring back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what this piece has to say about the larger context of voter demographics in the United States. 

**Answer**: It could be said that younger voters are seeking candidates who know that their delivery method as well as the content of their message matters. It seems that Sharpe makes for a formidable contender because he is rallying on social media, a grouping of social media platforms that appeal to the younger voters-who are more eager to see change on the political landscape. Third party voters have been disgruntled with the stolid old guard in politics in both Republican and Democratic parties, but it seems that the former has had a particularly rough time aligning their moral and social values with the more progressive perspectives that are much more common amongst younger voters. 

**Critique**: The piece says nothing about young voters

**Rationale**: The critique states that the piece says nothing about young voters, which implies that the information about younger voters in the answer is incorrect or irrelevant. However, the critique does not provide any information on what the piece actually says about voter demographics in the United States. Without knowing what the piece does say, I cannot improve the answer to accurately reflect the content of the piece. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to know what to write.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what this piece has to say about the larger context of voter demographics in the United States. 

**Answer**: No answer

**Critique**: Write a summary

**Rationale**: The critique simply instructs to "write a summary" without providing any specific information or guidance on what the summary should include regarding voter demographics in the United States. Without additional details or context from the source material, it is impossible to construct a meaningful summary. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

### Sample 765/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what this piece has to say about the larger context of voter demographics in the United States. 

**Answer**: The vast majority of voters in the United States are reluctant to vote for Republicans, meaning that Libertarians like candidate Larry Sharpe could present themselves as an alternative to voters who don't like the current administration. Sharpe is confident that he can beat Governor Andrew Cuomo in debates and other areas related to campaigning and do reasonably well in the election as a result. Despite the fact that history has shown third-party candidates in general to be uncompetitive in gubernatorial elections, Sharpe sees it as possible for him to win if he can gain enough support both online and through debates. Overall, voter demographics suggest that Libertarians have the potential to emerge as contenders in the upcoming gubernatorial election.

**Critique**: This is not true, only in blue areas

**Rationale**: The critique states that the statement about Libertarians having the potential to emerge as contenders is "not true, only in blue areas." This implies that the potential for Libertarians to be contenders is limited to areas that traditionally vote Democratic (blue areas). With this information, I can improve the answer by specifying that the potential for Libertarians is primarily in blue areas, without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the views of opposing sides in this article. 

**Answer**: Mayor Muriel Bowser and her Democratic supporters are in agreement that the protests staged at the White House are peaceful and merit the chance to be heard. However, the mayor's actions are considered performative with little real power on either side of the argument. In contrast, the Black Lives Matter Global Network views the mayor's actions as an attempt to appease white liberals.

**Critique**: The answer should mention Trump's side of the story since the question asks for both sides.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer is missing a perspective, specifically Trump's side of the story. This implies that to improve the answer, one should include information about Trump's views or actions regarding the protests. However, the critique does not provide any specific details about what Trump's side entails. Without access to the source material, it is impossible to accurately add this missing perspective. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without consulting the source.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Daisy's relationship with Louis?

**Answer**: According to the passage, Daisy murdered Louis. He died of a slit throat while they were together in their home. Daisy covered her crime by creating a false memory of his death and has been unable to remember what has happened since. The story makes it clear that Daisy was abusive toward and intimate with Louis before he was killed.

**Critique**: It's more accurate to say Daisy's mind created the false memories since it's not the kind of thing that can be done with deliberate effort. Furthermore, the story is Daisy remembering the event, so she can remember.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by clarifying the nature of Daisy's false memories and correcting the statement about her ability to remember. It suggests that the false memories were created by Daisy's mind rather than through deliberate effort, and it corrects the assertion that Daisy cannot remember what happened, as the story is about her remembering the event. These points allow for concrete improvements to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 768/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Daisy's relationship with Louis?

**Answer**: Daisy is married to an abusive and manipulative husband, Louis. Louis hurts her every time she makes a mistake, which is why Daisy has bruises, scars, and stitches all over her body. Louis manipulates Daisy into thinking it's always her fault when she ends up getting hurt. Daisy suffers from memory loss as a result of her blocking some memories out. Louis' abuse is so complete, he drives Daisy to kill him, which is what probably caused her mental break in the first place. Louis didn't know that Daisy was also tricking him into believing she was clumsy, so he would hurt her more, and his death at her hands would somehow be justified. 

**Critique**: Nothing in the story suggests Daisy was tricking Louis to hurt her.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that directly contradicts a part of the answer, namely the claim that "Daisy was tricking Louis into believing she was clumsy." By stating that "nothing in the story suggests Daisy was tricking Louis," the critique implies that this part of the answer should be removed or corrected. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the statement about Daisy tricking Louis, as the critique clearly indicates that this is not supported by the story.

### Sample 769/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Daisy's relationship with Louis?

**Answer**: Daisy has a husband named Louis. She is a very clumsy woman, but her husband loves her anyway. She seems to get injured a lot, but he behaves as if nothing has happened. They seem to have a good relationship. The more she recalls that her husband is gone and her fellow man was just a nightmare is how she gets more and more disturbed.

**Critique**: While Daisy gets disturbed as she remembers, the answer misrepresents the tone and implications in addition to the murder.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer misrepresents the tone and implications of the story, as well as the mention of a murder. However, it does not provide specific information on what the correct tone, implications, or details about the murder are. Without this information, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the correct tone, implications, and details about the murder. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Daisy's relationship with Louis?

**Answer**: The story indicates that Daisy murdered Louis; there was no playful banter or married squabbles. All the evidence points to her having had a premeditated murder. The story infers that she likely murdered Louis because she had planned it beforehand and felt she must commit the act to assuage some perceived guilt or anger.

**Critique**: The answer misrepresents Louis' motivation and the murder.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer misrepresents Louis' motivation and the murder, but it does not provide any specific information about what the correct motivations or circumstances are. Without additional details or corrections, it is impossible to improve the answer based solely on the critique. The critique fails to provide enough information to make a concrete improvement without referring back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Daisy's relationship with Louis?

**Answer**: Daisy was married to Louis for four years. They had breakfast each morning before Louis goes to work and then watches TV together after dinner. He supported and was sorry for her every act that was caused by either clumsiness or accidents. Daisy fantasizes about how Louis took care of her after her injury accidents. Louis is murdered by Daisy, but according to her hallucination, he wasn't murdered by her. |

**Critique**: Louis taking care of Daisy doesn't seem to be fantasies. That's made up.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about Louis taking care of Daisy being a fantasy is incorrect. This implies that the part of the answer stating "Daisy fantasizes about how Louis took care of her after her injury accidents" should be corrected to reflect that it is not a fantasy. The critique provides enough information to make this specific correction without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the voice in Daisy's head?

**Answer**: The voice in Daisy's head is apparently coaxing her to remember something she has done, presumably a crime. Of course, the voice is lying or mistaken about what happened; accidentally killing her husband does not make her a murderer. The voice is frustrating for Daisy and is likely a symptom of a serious mental illness.

**Critique**: The answer is completely wrong.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is "completely wrong," but it does not provide any information or implications about what the correct answer should be. Without additional details or guidance on what is accurate, it is impossible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material. The critique fails to offer any constructive direction or specific corrections that could be made to the answer.

### Sample 773/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the voice in Daisy's head?

**Answer**: The voice in Daisy's head is Louis, the husband she killed. The voice is trying to force Daisy to recall the things she purposely erased from her memory. The voice makes Daisy remember the day she killed Louis by slitting his throat. 

**Critique**: The answer omits the abuse, which was presumably the motivation for the murder.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer should include information about the abuse, which was presumably the motivation for the murder. This implies that the answer should be expanded to mention the abuse as a key element of the story. However, the critique does not specify what kind of abuse occurred or provide details about it. Without knowing the specifics of the abuse, it is not possible to accurately improve the answer. Therefore, additional information from the source material would be needed to make a concrete improvement.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Daisy's motives in killing Louis?

**Answer**: Daisy's reasons for killing Louis are never explicitly revealed in the story. The only clue the story has is her denial of responsibility. Daisy doesn't believe she could have done it.

**Critique**: The story's use of quotations around "clumsiness" implies the injuries were through Louis' abuse, which is her motivation for murder.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about Daisy's motives by highlighting the story's use of quotations around "clumsiness" to imply that the injuries were due to Louis' abuse. This suggests that Daisy's motivation for murder was related to the abuse she suffered. With this information, the answer can be improved by incorporating this implied motive without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Daisy's motives in killing Louis?

**Answer**: The little girl in Daisy's memories gets a knife and, within the same instance, is thinking about  killing Louis. She seems to believe, internal to think that she is finding pleasure and enjoyment in the thought of killing Louis. Two months ago, after she cut her hand, she starts laughing at the thought of Louis visiting her at the hospital, what could be the reason why she's enjoying the thought of killing Louis? Perhaps because the only way to save him and everything that happened with Louis was in the past is to not to be with him alive, and so she wouldn't feel guilty about killing him. The little girl must've thought that killing him would be easier than surviving on her own.

**Critique**: The answer uses made-up claims and incoherent thoughts. The story implies the "clumsiness" was Louis' abuse, which is Daisy's motivation for murder.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about Daisy's motives that can be used to improve the answer. It states that the story implies "clumsiness" was actually Louis' abuse, which is Daisy's motivation for murder. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by focusing on the abuse as the motive rather than the speculative and incoherent thoughts currently presented.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Daisy's motives in killing Louis?

**Answer**: Louis has probably been abusing Daisy for years, so she looked for an out. Her sudden "clumsiness" was a ploy to get him to hurt her more often. There would be evidence that she was beaten or hurt regularly because of doctor's visits and time spent in the hospital. Daisy likely pretended to "believe" Louis' apologies while planning to kill him. She probably thought that the years of abuse would be enough justification for her to slit his throat. 

**Critique**: The answer makes up claims about Daisy plotting things.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer contains speculative claims about Daisy's plotting, which are not supported by the story. However, it does not provide any specific information or corrections about what Daisy's actual motives are according to the story. Without knowing what the story actually says about Daisy's motives, I cannot improve the answer. The critique identifies an issue but does not guide how to correct it with concrete information.

**Critique**: Rephrase the last sentence to be more accurate about the narrator's relationship with drugs - "drug issue" implies addiction, which is not addressed in the text.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by suggesting that the phrase "drug issue" should be rephrased to more accurately reflect the narrator's relationship with drugs. This implies that the current wording may be misleading or incorrect, and a more precise description is needed. The critique does not require additional information from the source material to make this change; it simply calls for a rephrasing to avoid the implication of addiction.

**Critique**: The highlighted text is incorrect. Arthur was already on the beach when the sword came to him. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer.

What does the motif of words mean in the story?

**Answer**: Though this text doesn't focus on it, words are almost a theme in and of themselves. The narrator's mother always taught her the power of words and the importance of using them. When the narrator got to town and got a job at the library, their mastery and usage of language to become a writer was cultivated there. Furthermore, the narrator's second job, as a writer, relies on their mastery and use of words.

**Critique**: The text does focus on it

**Rationale**: The critique states that "the text does focus on it," which implies that the current answer incorrectly suggests that the text does not focus on the motif of words. However, the critique does not provide specific information on how the text focuses on the motif of words or what aspects should be highlighted or corrected in the answer.

The protagonist often remembers her mother quoting phrases like "tomorrow will just have to be what today wasn't" and uses words as strength to get through challenges in life like being awoken in the middle of the night by someone breaking into her apartment. Words are seen as a means of voice, protection and comfort.

**Critique**: Multiple sentences in this paragraph make no sense

**Rationale**: The critique states that multiple sentences in the paragraph make no sense, but it does not specify which sentences or provide any guidance on how to improve them. Without knowing which sentences are problematic or what the correct information should be, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique lacks the necessary information to revise the answer effectively without referring back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is the central conflict in the story?

**Answer**: Lindsay's mom and dad split when she was born. Her mom always tells her she's better off without him. She realizes that the son and parents of kids not on her school survived her mom's constant reminders of that line and the kids of her school are kind of flashy, she respected them and while her dad might had been a dickhead jerk-off she would have loved to have have had him around.

Her mom was a nurse and a bartender, Lindsay helps in the library. Her mom died and now Lindsay stopped writing, doesn't leave her apartment at night anymore, and avoids her book signings. She drastically need a father figure.

**Critique**: This is the backstory, but not the central conflict

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the provided answer focuses on the backstory rather than addressing the central conflict of the story. However, it does not provide any information or implications about what the central conflict actually is. Without additional details or guidance on what the central conflict might be, it is impossible to improve the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

### Sample 796/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is the central conflict in the story?

**Answer**: The central conflict of this story is the sudden intrusion into the protagonist's room by an unknown person. The protagonist is frightened and doesn't know what the intruder wants or if they are armed. The protagonist must protect herself and avoid being hurt or killed despite being unarmed.

**Critique**: The story does not reach this point, it cuts off before the action starts

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the story does not reach the point where the described conflict occurs, suggesting that the current answer is inaccurate. However, the critique does not provide any information about what the actual central conflict is or what should be included instead. Without knowing what the story covers before it cuts off, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to determine the true central conflict.

### Sample 797/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is the central conflict in the story?

**Answer**: Although a great deal of the story deals with the narrator's emotions surrounding her upbringing, there is foreshadowing that there will be a conflict from the beginning of the second paragraph, when the narrator mentions that "there was nothing special about the time or date." This creates tension and leads us to wonder why she woke at this hour. As she reminisces, the interlude helps to build tension, so when it is revealed there is an intruder in the apartment we are on the edge of our seats as readers — this is the central conflict of the story. 

**Critique**: Unnecessarily wordy and discusses the backstory

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is unnecessarily wordy and discusses the backstory, which implies that the answer should be more concise and focused directly on the central conflict. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by removing the extraneous details about the narrator's emotions and the foreshadowing, and directly stating that the central conflict is the presence of an intruder in the apartment. This makes the critique constructive because it provides enough information to streamline the answer.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the differences between sphere packing and circle packing, such as the focus on higher dimensions and packing density versus combinational patterns of tangency. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by expanding on the relationship between the two fields.

**Answer**: Dark-furred pups languished in kennels while their lighter-furred brethren got adopted. Black Dog Syndrome is the name shelter workers have given to the tendency of dark-furred pups to languish in kennels whil their lighters-furred brethren get adopted. Many shelters held discounts on dark-furred animals and some held Back in Black Fashion Shows with dark-furred dogs. People discriminate against dark pets.

**Critique**: The last sentence could be moved to the beginning of the paragraph since it serves as a direct response to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique provides a clear suggestion for improving the structure of the answer by moving the last sentence to the beginning. This is a specific and actionable change that can be made without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique implies that the sentence "People discriminate against dark pets" directly addresses the question and should be prioritized in the response.

### Sample 806/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about black dogs? 

**Answer**: According to shelter workers, black dog syndrome occurs when dark-furred pups languish in kennels while their lighter-furred brethren get adopted. Black dogs get euthanized at higher rates, with their images appearing less photogenic. Animal welfare experts believe the discrimination against black dogs occur due to superstition and facial expression.

**Critique**: The first sentence specifically refers to black dog syndrome and not the text's opinion on black dogs in general. This sentence seems like an elaboration, not necessarily a direct answer to the question. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the first sentence of the answer is more of an elaboration on black dog syndrome rather than a direct answer to the question about what the text says about black dogs. However, the critique does not provide specific guidance on what the text actually says about black dogs, nor does it suggest how to directly answer the question. Without additional information from the source material, it is unclear how to adjust the answer to directly address the question. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Critique**: It is unclear how the mood of the text is light.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer does not clearly explain how the mood of the text is light. However, it does not provide any specific information or suggestions on how to address this issue. Without additional details or guidance on what aspects of the text might contribute to a light mood, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Answer**: The train conductor thanks the narrator for saving a girl from getting run over by a train just three weeks prior to writing this. He hands the narrator a flyer about a help after trauma center and the narrator tells him he doesn't need it. The narrator's hormones rage again and the train conductor is probably feeling relieved that the narrator isn't going to tell anyone else.

**Critique**: The response inaccurately mentions that the narrator tells the conductor he doesn't need help, he only thinks it.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what is incorrect in the answer. It states that the narrator only thinks about not needing help, rather than telling the conductor. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the part where it says "the narrator tells him he doesn't need it" to "the narrator thinks he doesn't need it." This correction can be made without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: This should be written in the present tense. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by changing the tense from past to present. This is a clear and actionable instruction that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The editor can rewrite the answer in the present tense as follows: "The World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting at Davos, Switzerland, takes place during January 23-26 in 2017, kicking off with a better global economy than anticipated.

What does the text say about the Forum in 2016?

**Answer**: In 2016, the theme for the WEF in Davos, Switzerland was "Mastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution." It is likely that due to the terrible year for most economies, the theme means focusing on change and preparing for it, regardless of the type. The fact that very few changes were made to the global economy in 2016 after the financial crisis shows that the implementation of better change is not working.

**Critique**: The text doesn't say anything about it. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that "the text doesn't say anything about it," which indicates that the current answer is incorrect or irrelevant. However, the critique does not provide any information on what the text actually says about the Forum in 2016. Without knowing what the text does say, I cannot improve the answer.

Summarize the role of the keyboard in this story. 

**Answer**: The user of the keyboard is non-local, which means their actions are not directly causing the click and because of that, the science can be delayed indefinitely. The keyboard is part of a computer program.

**Critique**: The role of the keyboard is far more complex than the response would suggest - it ignores the existential philosophy entirely.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is missing an important aspect of the keyboard's role related to existential philosophy. However, it does not provide specific information or details about what the existential philosophy entails or how it relates to the keyboard's role. Without this information, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the existential philosophy's connection to the keyboard.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the role of the keyboard in this story. 

**Answer**: There is a Cherry MX Blue keyboard with 105 keys, which the author likes to describe as the best keyswitch for typing because of its click sounds. Initially, the click is a non-local sound, which means that it does not have a duration and that it marks only a single moment. The events in this story started with a backspace key on the keyboard being pressed.

**Critique**: The role of the keyboard is far more complex than the response would suggest - it ignores the existential philosophy entirely.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer is missing an important aspect of the keyboard's role related to existential philosophy. However, it does not provide specific details or guidance on how to incorporate this existential philosophy into the summary. Without additional information or context from the source material, it is not possible to improve the answer to include this aspect.

**Answer**: The article is about Cherry MX Blue, which is a keyboard that is best for typing.

**Critique**: There isnät more than one keyboard mentioned in the story si it would be better to say there is no answer to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the current answer does not address the question, which asks for a summary of different types of keyboards that accommodate various types of work. The critique implies that the article only mentions one type of keyboard (Cherry MX Blue) and does not provide information on other types. Therefore, the critique suggests that the answer should state that there is no answer to the question based on the provided information.

**Critique**: Additional detail about the dog could be included.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that more detail about the dog should be included, but it does not specify what additional details are needed. Without specific information or guidance on what details to add, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to find out more about the dog.

**Critique**: The answer omits the narrator's key decision to take Ray off life support.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the answer is missing the narrator's key decision to take Ray off life support.

The narrator agrees but knows that his mom doesn't agree with his condition and how she behaves accordingly.

**Critique**: Should include the narrator's key decision in the final sentence.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the final sentence of the answer should include the narrator's key decision. However, it does not specify what that key decision is.

**Critique**: Some of the information is not relevant to answering the question.

**Rationale**: The critique states that some information is not relevant but does not specify which parts of the answer are irrelevant.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story have to say about the mom's feelings about Ray after the accident?

**Answer**: After the accident, Ray's mom refuses to accept the fact that Ray might have died. She becomes a shell of a mother, totally devoted to Ray's recovery. Within her refusal to accept the truth, she traps herself in the horrid memories and loatheside of Ray's state. The story says that it's almost like Ray is still alive, being dependent on life support and ventilator.

**Critique**: It is incorrect to describe Ray's mom as 'a shell of a mother' or trapped in horrid memories. Nor it is the case that it's almost like Ray is still alive (rather, she thinks of him as still alive)

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections to the current answer. It indicates that the description of Ray's mom as "a shell of a mother" and being "trapped in horrid memories" is incorrect. It also clarifies that the statement "it's almost like Ray is still alive" should be changed to reflect that she actually thinks of him as still alive. These corrections allow for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 824/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story have to say about the mom's feelings about Ray after the accident?

**Answer**: The mom feels great sadness and loss after her son was injured in the accident and has entered a permanent vegetative state. She refuses to accept the facts of the matter and is stuck in a state of hope, although this becomes frustrating and even painful to see as time goes on. Ultimately, the story suggests that the mom would like to end her son's life in order to end her own suffering, but she can't bring herself to do it.

**Critique**: It is not clear from the story that the mom does want to end Ray's life - in fact it suggests the opposite.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the statement about the mom wanting to end Ray's life is incorrect and suggests the opposite is true. This implies that the story portrays the mom as not wanting to end Ray's life. Therefore, the answer can be improved by removing or correcting the part about the mom wanting to end Ray's life, and instead emphasizing her ongoing hope and refusal to accept the situation. This can be done without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides enough information to make this change.

**Answer**: The SR-25 pattern is not compatible with rifles using Springfield Armory M1A pattern magazines, FN FAL pattern magazines, or HK417/MR308/MR762 pattern magazines. The AR-10B variant uses proprietary modified M14 magazines, while the AR-10A variant uses standard SR-25 pattern magazines. The Noveske N6 version prior to Gen 3 used AR-10B type magazines, but with the introduction of the N6 Gen 3, the design was changed to utilize the more common SR25-type. Rock River Arms LAR8 uses proprietary FAL style magazines.

**Critique**: The article doesn't discuss issues with the SR-25 pattern.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the article does not discuss issues with the SR-25 pattern, which implies that the current answer is incorrect or irrelevant to the question. However, the critique does not provide any information on what the actual issues with the SR-25 pattern are. Without additional information or guidance on what the issues might be, it is not possible to improve the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

They are not interested in abstractions or principles. They seek power and intend to win it with whatever it takes. If that includes getting you fired or silencing you, or threatening your family, okay.

**Critique**: Everything beyond the first couple sentences is unattested/speculation.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that everything beyond the first couple of sentences in the answer is speculative and not supported by the source material. This implies that the first couple of sentences are accurate and should be retained, while the rest should be removed. However, the critique does not provide any information on what should replace the speculative content, leaving a gap in the answer.

They are described as not being shocked by naughty words. They are described as pretending to be shocked by naughty words when it's useful.

**Critique**: It is redundant to state that the left are described as the left.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a redundancy in the answer, specifically the phrase "They are described as the left." This implies that the phrase should be removed to improve the clarity and conciseness of the answer. The critique provides enough information to make this specific change without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about liberals?

**Answer**: The author describes liberals as "deadly serious." They believe that politics is war and are not interested in abstractions or principles. They seek power and intend to win it with whatever it takes. They want to crush anyone who stands in their way. They seem to be all about power.

**Critique**: Redundancy--it is stated twice that they are after power.

**Rationale**: The critique points out redundancy in the answer by stating that the pursuit of power is mentioned twice. This implies that the answer can be improved by removing one of the redundant statements about liberals being after power. The critique provides enough information to make this specific change without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 830/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How does the author characterize his side?

**Answer**: He describes them as "deadly serious" and "seeking power." They are also "serious about winning power."

**Critique**: These descriptors apply to the left. The author seems to be right-leaning.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the descriptors "deadly serious" and "seeking power" apply to the left, while the author is right-leaning. This implies that the current answer incorrectly attributes these characteristics to the author's side. To improve the answer, one would need to remove or correct the descriptors that are inaccurately applied to the author's side. However, the critique does not provide specific descriptors or characteristics that accurately describe the author's side, which means we cannot write a better answer without consulting the source material to understand how the author characterizes his side.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what the narrator has to say about opportunities. 

**Answer**: The narrator believes that people are given opportunities in life-which is why they should not be afraid of missing out on them. However, the narrator also thinks that people should not be afraid of losing opportunities either. The narrator thinks that we should enjoy the opportunities we have while they are still available to us.

**Critique**: It is omitted that people are given first opportunities in many aspects of life. Whether it’s a job or love, people always wonder if there’s a better one out there. With no ability to compare, we are unable to decide if something is worth committing to.

**Rationale**: The critique provides additional information about the narrator's perspective on opportunities, specifically mentioning the concept of "first opportunities" and the idea of wondering if there is a better option available. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by incorporating these specific points into the summary. The critique implies that the narrator discusses the challenge of committing to opportunities due to the inability to compare them, which can be added to the existing answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the whistleblower complaint?

**Answer**: The whistleblower complaint is at the heart of a controversy that has triggered an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. The complaint indicates that the cover-up is aimed at concealing the knowing criminal behavior of the administration. The whistleblower claims that the White House officials moved to put a word-for-word transcript of the conversation into a server separate from the normal one reserved for such matters. The whistleblower also claims that the administration's legal counsel intervened and directed the White House officials to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system.

**Critique**: The response should include what exactly the alleged criminal act was. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer is missing specific information about the alleged criminal act mentioned in the whistleblower complaint. However, it does not provide any details or implications about what the alleged criminal act is. Without knowing what the alleged criminal act is, I cannot improve the answer to include this information.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why does the narrator's friend accuse him of being jealous?

**Answer**: From the passage, it seems that the other man says that his wife woke up the protagonist, Who was jealous because he thought he would have longer to stay with her had he not seen his friend wake him. From this, it can be inferred that the narrator believed that because he was born with mediocre genes and looks, it was more likely that he found love.

**Critique**: The servant is not the wife. The narrator is disfigured, this is not simply something he believes in. Lastly, the reason for their argument is completely different.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections and clarifications that allow for a concrete improvement to the answer.

Loneliness can also be temporary, can can be resolved in simply knowing the other person exists-that seems to be what the man did in going on a sojourn without her, to return to her.

**Critique**: This should be "necessarily".

### Sample 845/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what the story has to say about loneliness. 

**Answer**: The story's message is that being alone can cause deep sadness and even emptiness. However, if we reach out to those around us and allow others in, we can be happy and content. This is demonstrated by the woman repairing the man's house while he slept, and the man beginning to visit her in return. When the man returns, they connect and grow closer while noticing how much they missed each other. The pattern continues until they are able to see each other for who they really are, which leads to a deeper love and happiness than they could have ever imagined. Loneliness is shown to be something that can be overcome if the right people enter our lives.

**Critique**: When the man returns, they actually grow apart as the man stops visiting the woman. This is inaccurate.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts a part of the current answer. It states that instead of growing closer, the man and woman actually grow apart as the man stops visiting the woman. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the inaccurate part about them growing closer. The editor can revise the answer to reflect that the man and woman grow apart, which aligns with the critique's information.

### Sample 846/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what the story has to say about loneliness. 

**Answer**: There is an immediate incompatibility in this story between the male and female character. They live across the street from one another, in two houses that appear completely the same at first glance. But on the inside each house is in complete and utter disrepair. This makes the couples attraction. Each day the man fixes her house while she cleans his and they seem to get closer and closer. Then they both realize they have deep-rooted loneliness and that they fix each others wounds every day. The woman realizes that the reason the man put in repairs around the house was because of her. This is an odd love story that leaves the reader wondering which gender they are rooting for.

**Critique**: This answer is off base. This explains the relationship between the man and woman, not really loneliness.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the current answer focuses on the relationship between the man and woman rather than addressing the theme of loneliness. However, it does not provide specific guidance on how to correct the answer to focus on loneliness. Without additional information or specific suggestions on how to address the theme of loneliness, it is not possible to improve the answer solely based on the critique. The critique identifies a problem but does not imply a clear solution or provide enough information to revise the answer effectively.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what the story has to say about loneliness. 

**Answer**: The story shows that loneliness can ultimately be overcome by caring for others. Just because a person is alone does not mean that they are lonely. There is always somebody that can and will care for them. However, it also shows that true happiness can only be found when someone has someone to share it with.

**Critique**: This is inaccurate. It should say that the woman tells the man that just because a person likes to be alone, doesn't mean they are lonely.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what the story should convey regarding loneliness. It mentions that the woman tells the man that liking to be alone does not equate to loneliness.

This happens for a long time until one day he returns from a trip to find her place nicely landscaped and motionless, but she's gone. She left a note for him, saying that "I will always love you no matter where we go."

**Critique**: This is both irrelevant to the answer and inaccurate ( the man doesn't hate when the woman ventures over, and she never leaves).

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer is both irrelevant and inaccurate, specifically pointing out that the man does not hate when the woman ventures over and that she never leaves. However, the critique does not provide any information about what the actual surprise in the conclusion of the story is.

The surprise is that the woman had taken it upon herself to renovate the man's house while he was away, and his subsequent return prompted her to pack her belongings and move in with him.

**Critique**: This is not the surprise. The woman does not renovate the home when the man is away, she only takes care of it. The surprise is that when the man decides to move again, the woman admits her love for in and decides to move with him.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what the actual surprise in the story is, correcting the details in the current answer. It clarifies that the woman only takes care of the house, not renovates it, and that the surprise involves the man's decision to move again and the woman's admission of love and decision to move with him.

The story is 5-10 pages long, and other information is scarce, but this moment is the turning point of the story.

**Critique**: This answer is completely wrong. It discusses inciting incident and a turning point.

### Sample 854/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the source of tension in the story.

**Answer**: The tension arises from the theme of loneliness versus solitude. Each character demonstrates how tasks are done on a solo basis to embetter and enhance the vessels in which we live-but how we, as humans, are transient. However, love is not transient, and the same care given to the vessels that provide for us can be converted and shared with another human being. The tension lifts when the two characters understand the difference between being alone and being lonely. 

**Critique**: This answer is completely off base. The tension is not about understanding the difference between being alone and being lonely. This is more of an aside the woman tells the man.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer is incorrect regarding the source of tension, but it does not provide any information about what the actual source of tension is. It only states that the current explanation is more of an aside rather than the main source of tension. Without additional information on what the correct source of tension is, I cannot improve the answer.

### Sample 855/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the source of tension in the story.

**Answer**: The primary tension in the story is in the relationship between the man and the woman. The conflict arises when the man starts to repair the woman's house, and the woman starts repairing the man's house instead. The man feels slighted, thinking that the woman might have found somebody else to do her work. The two then start to miss each other and eventually reconcile. The man was uncertain of their future, wondering if the woman would stay by his side. The tension is resolved when they embrace and leave in the same moving truck together.

**Critique**: This lacks context. The man feels slighted because another man begins to work on the woman's house.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It clarifies that the reason the man feels slighted is due to another man beginning to work on the woman's house. This detail can be incorporated into the answer to provide a clearer understanding of the source of tension in the story.

### Sample 856/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the source of tension in the story.

**Answer**: The primary source of tension in the story is a discord between the two housekeepers about why each has repaired the other's house. The man feels that since he does not give to others, he does not deserve the same from somebody else. The woman feels that somebody deserving of care and compassion deserves to receive it, no matter their past. The tension in the story stems from their inability to reconcile their differing views and move past their conflicts. Eventually, they do reconcile their feelings and come to a mutual agreement.

**Critique**: The tension in the story stems from the man and woman's inability to address their true feelings for each other.

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific alternative source of tension, which is the inability of the man and woman to address their true feelings for each other. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by focusing on the emotional aspect of their relationship rather than the disagreement about house repairs. The critique implies that the true source of tension is more personal and emotional, which can be incorporated into the revised answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the source of tension in the story.

**Answer**: The man and the woman are both lone, shut-in types, who each happen to have striking traits that make them (viewed externally) attractive. The man's outward neatness endears him to the woman, whereas the woman looks lovely to the man - but their personalities are analogous, in fact. They have been struck by the opposite gender part of their psychological type. They have found each other, at least superficially, and find each other agreeable. The perfect coupling turns sour, however, when the man decides to leave.

**Critique**: The woman is not described as a lone, shut in type nor are striking traits really mentioned. This should be omitted.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the description of the woman as a "lone, shut-in type" with "striking traits" is incorrect and should be omitted. This provides clear guidance on what to remove from the answer. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the incorrect description of the woman, focusing instead on the accurate elements of the tension between the characters.

What does the text say about sleep paralysis in children?

**Answer**: Sleep paralysis is when a person is in a state of sleep paralysis and can't break free from being held or touched in any way from a monster. The narrator says that children are the hardest to save because their imaginations are a lot wilder and they don't understand how one minute they can be hugging their parents and the next minute an unknown figure is holding them tight crushing them. They are too weak and confused and just before they draw a last breath they are in a sleep paralysis. The narrator can't describe the feeling of fear and sickness he gets when he realizes a child does not feel safe in their bedroom. The narrator tells parents to make their children understand that their bedroom is the safest place and that they need to sleep in their beds.

**Critique**: The last two sentences don't are irrelevant to the question. 

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the last two sentences of the answer are irrelevant to the question about sleep paralysis in children. This implies that these sentences should be removed to improve the answer.

What does the article say about the response to the pandemic in nations besides France?

**Answer**: Spain has an outright ban on outdoor exercise. The Czech Republic has had to wear facemasks outside at all times by law, but can from today leave home without one. Denmark and Austria, which were two of the first European countries to go into lockdown, will start a slow exit from next week. Denmark will reopen nurseries and primary schools from April 15, while Austria will allow small shops, DIY stores and garden centers to open from April 14. The German government has drawn up an action plan to phase in a step-by-step return to normality, including mandatory mask-wearing in public, limits on gatherings and the rapid tracing of infection chains. However, the plan assumes the pandemic will last through to 2021. Disease experts in a number of countries have warned that, until a vaccine is developed, there may be no way to end the lockdown without the virus spreading again.

**Critique**: The response contains extraneous information not useful for the task. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response contains extraneous information but does not specify which parts are extraneous.

Cf., "Inspector Andrew Johnson from Leith Police Station said that police would be having a ‘high-visibility presence’ in the area" The police are looking into the attack but forensic information has not been revealed yet.

The attack is being investigated by police and the two Majors, Guy and Blane, along with DCS Pendock, who investigate the crime. The police's investigative branch is the Serious and Organised Crime Division (SOCO).

**Critique**: The names Guy, Blane, and DCS Pendock do not appear in the article.

**Critique**: These attacks are usually associated with domestic terror.

**Rationale**: The critique states that "these attacks are usually associated with domestic terror," which directly contradicts the statement in the answer that the arson attack is unusual because it is not usually associated with domestic terror.

He described white supremacists as "some very fine people." He told four women of color, all citizens and members of Congress, to "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came." He made a joke about Pocahontas during a ceremony honoring Native American World War II veterans. He launched his political career by falsely claiming that the first black president was not really American. He launched his presidential campaign by describing Mexicans as "rapists." He has described women, variously, as "a dog," "a pig," and "horseface," as well as "bleeding badly from a facelift" and having "blood coming out of her wherever." He has been accused of sexual assault or misconduct by multiple women. He enthusiastically campaigned for a Senate candidate who was accused of molesting multiple teenage girls. He waved around his arms, while giving a speech, to ridicule a physically disabled person. He has called for his opponents and critics to be investigated and jailed. He uses a phrase popular with dictators - "the enemy of the people" - to describe journalists. He attempts to undermine any independent source of information that he does not like, including judges, scientists, journalists, election officials, the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the Congressional Budget Office and the National Weather Service. He has tried to harass the chairman of the Federal Reserve into lowering interest rates. He said that a judge could not be objective because of his Mexican heritage. He obstructed justice by trying to influence an investigation into his presidential campaign. He violated federal law by directing his lawyer to pay $280,000 in hush money to cover up two apparent extramarital affairs. He made his fortune partly through wide-scale financial fraud. He has refused to release his tax returns. He falsely accused his predecessor of wiretapping him. He claimed that federal law-enforcement agents and prosecutors regularly fabricated evidence, thereby damaging the credibility of criminal investigations across the country. He has ordered children to be physically separated from their parents. He has suggested that America is no different from or better than Vladimir Putin's Russia. He has called America a "hellhole." He is the president of the United States, and he is a threat to virtually everything that the United States should stand for.

**Critique**: It does not seem like a racist or sexist comment.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer does not seem like a racist or sexist comment, but it does not provide any specific guidance on how to improve the answer. It does not identify which parts of the answer are incorrect or irrelevant, nor does it suggest what should be included to address the question about Trump's racism and sexism.

**Answer**: Because he has access to previously unavailable material, like the private diary kept by King George VI during World War II, and because he knows the material well and is a good historian.

**Critique**: This comment is unnecessary and could be omitted.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the comment is unnecessary and could be omitted, but it does not specify which part of the answer is unnecessary. Since the answer contains multiple pieces of information, it is unclear which part should be removed.

**Answer**: This article describes the chaotic events that surround the current White House and the President.

**Critique**: The model's response is vague and lacking in detail. The text contains sufficient information for the model to use in its answer.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the model's response is vague and lacking in detail, and it suggests that the text contains sufficient information for the model to use in its answer. However, the critique does not provide specific details or guidance on what additional information should be included to improve the answer. Without knowing what specific details are available in the source text, it is not possible to concretely improve the answer based solely on the critique. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement without referring back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What did the president's lawyer cousel the president?

**Answer**: Not to speak to Special Counsel

**Critique**: The answer fails to mention why the lawyer advised the president not to speak to the special counsel. The model ought to make use of sufficient information provided in the article.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer is missing an explanation for why the lawyer advised the president not to speak to the special counsel. However, it does not provide any information or implications about what the reason might be. Without knowing the specific reason from the source material, I cannot improve the answer to include the missing explanation. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source to know what to write.

### Sample 901/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What did the president's lawyer cousel the president?

**Answer**: He said that he was peddlying in a perjury trap.

**Critique**: The model's response is not exactly accurate. According to the text, the lawyer advised the president not to speak to the special counsel to avoid walking into a perjury trap, but the model's answer says otherwise. This needs to be corrected and written more accurately.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what the lawyer actually advised the president, which is to not speak to the special counsel to avoid a perjury trap. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the phrasing to accurately reflect the lawyer's advice. The critique implies the correct action to take, which is to adjust the wording of the answer to match the information given in the critique.

### Sample 902/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Curzon's family?

**Answer**: Curzon was the only son of Colonel Alfred Nathaniel Curzon, by his marriage to Henrietta Mary Montagu. He was also a nephew of George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, head of the family. Curzon's father died in 1920, leaving him as the heir presumptive, and on the death of Marquess Curzon in 1925 Richard Nathaniel Curzon became head of the Curzon family. His inheritance included Kedleston Hall, the baronetcy created for his ancestor Sir John Curzon (1598–1686), and the new title of Viscount Scarsdale.

**Critique**: - The answer omits that his uncle's marriage had produced only three daughters, and he was widowed in 1906, and even though he remarried to have a male heir, it was not to be, leaving Curzon's father as the heir presumptive to the family estates.

- It also omits that in 1911 his uncle was created Viscount Scarsdale, with a special remainder to his father and his father's male heirs. 

- It omits Richard's wives and daughters. It should be included.


**Rationale**: The critique provides specific details that are missing from the current answer, such as the fact that Curzon's uncle's marriage produced only daughters, his uncle's remarriage, the creation of the Viscount Scarsdale title with a special remainder, and information about Richard's wives and daughters. These details can be directly added to the answer to improve it without needing to refer back to the source material. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it allows for a concrete improvement to the answer.

### Sample 903/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about Curzon's grandchildren?

**Answer**: He had four daughters, but no sons. His eldest daughter Anne Mildred Curzon married Major W. J. L. Willson, and had two sons and a daughter. His second daughter Gloria Mary Curzon married J. G. Bearman, and had two sons. His third daughter Juliana Eveline Curzon married firstly G. D. S. Smith, and had two daughters and a son. She was later married to Frederick Nettleford, Sir Dudley Cunliffe-Owen, and John Roberts. His youngest daughter Diana Geraldine Curzon married firstly Frederick Nettleford, and later married John Roberts.

**Critique**: The last sentence is inaccurate. It repeats the names of Juliana Curzon's spouses. The article also did not mention Diana Curzon's spouse or child. This error should be corrected.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the inaccuracy in the last sentence of the answer, indicating that it incorrectly repeats the names of Juliana Curzon's spouses instead of providing information about Diana Curzon's spouse or child. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the incorrect repetition and acknowledging the missing information about Diana Curzon. However, since the critique does not provide the correct details about Diana Curzon's spouse or child, the editor would need to consult the source material to fill in this missing information.

### Sample 904/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Coldrain?

**Answer**: "January 1st" is the third single and sixth track of their sixth studio album. It is produced by Michael Baskette and was released on August 8, 2019. It is the first soft song by the band to ever be released as a single. The singles, the teases, and the singer's request of it to be a music video along with the music video prove that the band was ambitious in portraying the song (a slower-paced song) as a single.

**Critique**: This information is more about the song than the band. It would be better to omit this.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the current answer focuses too much on a specific song rather than providing information about the band, Coldrain. However, it does not provide any specific information about the band itself that could be used to improve the answer. Without additional details about Coldrain, such as their history, style, or achievements, it is not possible to rewrite the answer to focus more on the band without consulting the source material.

**Answer**: Coldrain is a Japanese rock band from Tokyo. Their sixth studio album features their first ever soft song, "January 1st". The song is about the death of a dog and was written to cope about their loss. The music video for the song was released alongside the single.

**Critique**: There is no mention of Tokyo in the article, so it would be better to omit this.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the mention of Tokyo is incorrect and should be omitted. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the reference to Tokyo. The critique does not require additional information from the source material to make this change.

**Answer**: They are a Japanese rock band. They have not released any slow songs as singles prior to this single, which is why this song is ambitious. They have now released several slow songs as singles, including the song "Coexist," released the month prior.

**Critique**: The members of the band should be included. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests including the members of the band in the answer, but it does not provide any specific names or details about the band members. Without this information, I cannot improve the answer to include the band members without referring back to the source material to find out who they are. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

### Sample 907/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Coldrain?

**Answer**: The text describes Coldrain as a Japanese rock band that released the single "January 1st" on 8 August 2019. The song was written about band frontman Masato Hayakawa's dog who passed away on January 1, 2019, and the music video was directed by Koh Yamada. The song was written to cope with Hayakawa's loss and it became the band's third single. The track falls into the category of alternative rock and has a tempo of 150 BPM. The song currently has 710,000 views on YouTube.

**Critique**: This relates more to information about the song than it does information about the band. It should be omitted.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer focuses more on details about a specific song rather than providing information about the band Coldrain itself. However, the critique does not provide any specific information about the band that should be included instead. Without additional details about the band, I cannot improve the answer to focus on Coldrain as a band rather than the song. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to know what specific information about the band should be included.

**Answer**: The title of Coldrain's newest album is The Side Effects. It is the band's sixth studio album, following a second album titled Coexist. It was produced by Michael Baskette and released on August 8th, 2019.

**Critique**: Coexist is a single, not a second album. This should be changed to say "with a single called Coexist".

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It identifies an error in the current answer regarding "Coexist" being incorrectly labeled as a second album when it is actually a single. The critique clearly states what the correct information should be, allowing the editor to revise the answer to say "with a single called Coexist" without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Coldrain's album, The Side Effects?

**Answer**: The sixth studio album by Japanese rock band Coldrain, The Side Effects, features the song "January 1st." The track is released as a single and the sixth track on the album. It is alternatively rock, 150 BPM in the key of A major, and runs for four minutes and 40 seconds. The song was written by Masato Hayakawa to cope about his dog who passed away on January 1, 2019. The music video for "January 1st" was directed by Koh Yamada. The text concludes that The Side Effects is the album with the song "January 1st."

**Critique**: This information pertains more to the single specifically rather than the album. It would be better to omit this.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the information provided in the answer is more relevant to the single "January 1st" rather than the album "The Side Effects" as a whole. However, it does not provide specific details about what should be included about the album itself. Without additional information about the album, such as its themes, other tracks, or overall reception, I cannot improve the answer to focus more on the album without referring back to the source material.

### Sample 910/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Coldrain's album, The Side Effects?

**Answer**: Coldrain's album, The Side Effects, is the band's sixth studio album. It was written by Masato Hayakawa and produced by Michael Baskette. Two singles from the album, "January 1st" and "Coexist" were released a month apart (Coexist was released first). "January 1st" was the last single to be released before the band released their full album. 

**Critique**: The single is written by Masato and produced by Michael. This doesn't necessarily mean that the album is. This should be omitted.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the information about the album being written by Masato Hayakawa and produced by Michael Baskette may not be accurate for the entire album, as it specifically applies to the single. The critique implies that this information should be omitted from the description of the album. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the statement about the album's writing and production, as the critique suggests it may not be correct for the entire album.

### Sample 911/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Coldrain's album, The Side Effects?

**Answer**: The album The Side Effects is Coldrain's sixth studio album. It was produced by Michael Baskette and contains the track "January 1ST" which was written by Masato Hayakawa in memory of his dog who passed on Januray 1, 2019. The album contains alternative rock songs with a soft element. The music video for "January 1ST" was directed by Koh Yamada.

**Critique**: It's only mentioned that "January 1st" is a soft song, not the whole album.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the description of the album as containing "alternative rock songs with a soft element" is incorrect because only the song "January 1ST" is mentioned as being soft. This implies that the description of the entire album as having a soft element should be revised to accurately reflect that only "January 1ST" is soft. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by adjusting the description of the album's overall sound.

**Critique**: This entire answer is incorrect. It only discusses the single, and it's mention of the album is false.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the entire answer is incorrect and that it only discusses the single, with the mention of the album being false. However, it does not provide any information on what the correct details about Coldrain's album, "The Side Effects," should be.

**Critique**: It's not said in the text that "January 1st" is the first single released about a dog. It would be better to omit this.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the statement about "January 1st" being the first single released about a dog is not supported by the text.

**Answer**: Their first song to be written by them to be released as a single. Masato Hayakawa is the first of the band to direct and release a music video. It was Hayakawa's music video, he described the song as a "drop in his respect."

**Critique**: This entire answer is incorrect. The song wasn't the first written by them to be released as a single. Masato Hayakawa did not direct the music video, and the text mentions nothing about dropping in respect.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies that the entire answer is incorrect but does not provide any specific information or corrections that would allow for an improved answer without referring back to the source material. It points out inaccuracies but does not offer the correct facts or details needed to construct a better answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why are some people worried about the squeegee boys?

**Answer**: Many people have expressed fear and discomfort around the squeegee boys, worried about aggressive behavior and damage to cars. The author's experience spending time with the squeegee boys on an I-83 exit ramp leads them to conclude that there is not a significant problem of aggression. Rather, most of the drivers simply ignore them, while others do seem to offer money or niceties to the boys. The motivation for the boys appears less to be extortion or destruction, and more likely to be financial necessity.

**Critique**: Much of this answer is not relevant to the question being asked.

**Rationale**: The critique states that much of the answer is not relevant to the question, but it does not specify which parts are irrelevant or what should be included instead. Without specific guidance on what is relevant or what should be removed, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the context and determine what information directly addresses the question.

The dragon takes Allene to her home, Farlig Dyre, and places her near a fire. The dragon is upset that the king is also there and leaves the child to die.

**Critique**: The dragon does not leave the baby to die.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts a part of the current answer. It states that the dragon does not leave the baby to die, which implies that the dragon's actions or intentions regarding the baby are different from what is described. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the part about the dragon leaving the child to die.

She is then pulled from the water by the crew and held by her king. She is then taken to an island where she is reunited with her baby.

**Critique**: The queen is not reunited with her baby.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the part about the queen being reunited with her baby is incorrect. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing or correcting the statement about the reunion with the baby.

What were Salucci's twenty years as court architect of Wurttemberg like?

**Answer**: Salucci was appointed court architect in 1818. He built the Royal Pavilion in Weil near Esslingen in collaboration with the Queen Catherine of Wurttemberg. After her death, he built her Wurttemberg Mausoleum. He also designed the Schloss Rosenstein. He was dismissed in 1839 after a dispute with a superior. Dry rot was discovered in the castle in 1839, and Salucci was made responsible.

**Critique**: The response summarizes Salucci's time bit misses to describe it as a challenging time.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that Salucci's twenty years as court architect were challenging, which is an evaluative statement about his experience. While the critique does not provide specific details on why it was challenging, it implies that the existing answer should be adjusted to reflect this perspective. The current answer mentions a dispute and being held responsible for dry rot, which can be interpreted as challenges. Therefore, the answer can be improved by explicitly stating that these events contributed to a challenging period for Salucci. For example, the answer could be revised to: "Salucci's twenty years as court architect of Wurttemberg were challenging. He was appointed in 1818 and collaborated with Queen Catherine on the Royal Pavilion in Weil near Esslingen. After her death, he built her Wurttemberg Mausoleum and designed the Schloss Rosenstein.

Charlotte Hays describes the intolerance of college students as "ill-prepared to engage with the ideas" comparing it to the failure of modern education to elucidate students' understanding of fairness and democracy.

What does the article say about fascism?

**Answer**: Fascists were known for street brawls and disruption to forestall debate. A few students chanted "fascist" when Christina Hoff Sommers spoke at Lewis & Clark law school. Steverson believes yelling fascist is an attempt to intimidate. US News holds that fascism is the practice of using street brawls or violence to maintain power.

**Critique**: Not sure the last sentence is supported

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the last sentence of the answer may not be supported by the source material. However, it does not provide any information on what the correct or supported statement should be.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about fascism?

**Answer**: According to Janet Steverson, the protestors were acting in a "fascist" way. Steverson is the diversity and inclusion dean at Lewis & Clark College. The students were reportedly harrasing Christina Hoff Sommers, a guest of the Federalist Society, on the roster. Toward Sommers, the protestors hurled nasty insults including the popular "fascist" epithet in an attempt to intimidate her. She said they were behaving in a macro-aggressive manner. The students didn't know the definition of the all-purpose label "fascist", nor its associated doctrine on street brawls and disruption to forestall debate.

**Critique**: Conflates Steverson and the author of the article and includes irrelevant information

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer incorrectly merges the perspectives of Janet Steverson and the author of the article, and it also includes irrelevant information. However, the critique does not specify which parts of the answer are irrelevant or how to separate Steverson's views from the author's. Without knowing what the article actually says about fascism or which parts of the answer are incorrect or irrelevant, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer. I would need to refer back to the source material to accurately distinguish between Steverson's views and the author's and to identify the irrelevant information.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article have to say about the state of education at Lewis & Clark College?

**Answer**: The concerning result from the protest is that the students have vastly overlooked the idea of free speech and are too closed minded when it comes to ideas that are different from their own. The cast to this, is the current state of students on campus. Laws schools used to teach students about basic concepts and the furthering of knowledge. Of course there are endless things to learn within a variety of majors. However students pay $$$$$ for an education and somehow wind up on the same level or even worse than when they started. This is largely due to the election of professors who are more emotionally sensitive and conversational/activist based. They tend to recognize problems outside of their fields of expertise and take heavy political stances. On top of that they make the material they cover next to impossible to relate to. Coliallege is the cornerstone of the society and our democracy, the state of education is a major concern.

**Critique**: Remove irrelevant and incoherent information

**Rationale**: The critique instructs to "remove irrelevant and incoherent information," but it does not specify which parts of the answer are considered irrelevant or incoherent. Without specific guidance on which information to remove, it is impossible to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material to determine what is relevant and coherent. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article have to say about the state of education at Lewis & Clark College?

**Answer**: While the article praises the institution for its contributions to no-tolerance policy of fascism in part due to the role it played in generating a progressive atmosphere in the student body, it also points to what it describes as an attempt to stymie free discourse by threatening to tear down a speaker with a differing point of view. Steverson, the diversity dean at the institution, tells Inside Higher Ed that the poor students were "antsy" at having to wait for so long for the speech to end. This description undermines the seriousness of the mostly liberal protestors' actions, and cast light on the state of education at Lewis & Clark, as it appears students can poorly heckle well-meaning speakers, resorting to slanderous name-calling, without consequence to their behavior.

**Critique**: Remove irrelevant and incoherent information

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer contains irrelevant and incoherent information, but it does not specify which parts are irrelevant or incoherent. Without specific guidance on what to remove or how to improve the coherence of the answer, it is not possible to make a concrete improvement without referring back to the source material.

**Critique**: The response should be reworded for clarity on who is the mother.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should be reworded for clarity regarding who the mother is. This implies that the current wording might be confusing or ambiguous about the identity of the mother. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by rephrasing it to make it clear who the mother is. For example, I could reword it to: "The narrator explains that her mother raised her alone. She admits that the hardest part of being a single mother is the lack of support, but she proudly mentions her daughter's strength and tenacity, which she attributes to seeing her mother excel in life despite not having a father as a support."

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific suggestion for rephrasing the sentence to clarify the role of Doug Pederson and Wentz in the Eagles' comeback. It implies that the focus should be on Pederson's directive rather than Wentz passively receiving a game plan. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by rephrasing it as suggested.

**Critique**: Pederson suggested quicker, not less passing.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Answer**: They were successful because of Doug Pederson. The Philadelphia Eagles' coaching coach was excellent. Pederson was able to get his team out of bed on days when they didn't want to, which is significant. It splits the difference in the game. Pedersons told Wentz to let the offense work for him and led to impressive results. The Philadelphia Eagles had players lined up who were injured but because of Pederson's coaching, they had the win.

**Critique**: It is not stated that Pederson was able to get his team out of bed on days when they didn't want to, which is significant.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about Pederson getting his team out of bed on days they didn't want to is not accurate.

**Answer**: LaFleur made a number of questionable call during the Packers-Eagles game on Thursday night. He opted for a field goal on 4th down from the Eagles' 13-yard line, giving the Packers a 13-7 lead when he could have taken a more aggressive approach. Against a struggling Packers' run game, LaFleur seemingly had a containable passing attack and should have taken advantage of the opportunity. Additionally, LeFleur made absurdly conservative play calls in the second half, letting the game slip away from them. LaFleur's inexperience shows in his play-calling. Considering the number of times the Packers had the ball, he should have pushed the envelope more considering their weaknesses. He should have taken more risks on offense in order to increase their chances for success.

**Critique**: It is not stated that  considering the number of times the Packers had the ball, he should have pushed the envelope more considering their weaknesses; he should have taken more risks on offense in order to increase their chances for success.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about LaFleur needing to push the envelope more and take more risks on offense is not stated. However, it does not provide any specific information or alternative suggestions on what should be included instead.

**Answer**: Matt LaFleur is a rookie head coach and made some questionable decisions. He had the team kick a field goal at a time when they were in the lead, rather than going for a touchdown. The Packers also had no run game. Aaron Jones had 13 carries for 21 yards.

**Critique**: It is omitted that he did not seem to trust Aaron Rodgers to make a play. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It suggests that LaFleur's play calls were influenced by a lack of trust in Aaron Rodgers to make a play. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding this detail about LaFleur's decision-making process.

**Critique**: It is not stated that he knows Aaron Rodgers can get out of any mess they can get him into and punts to try to ensure the Packers stay up by three. It's possible they went into halftime with the lead had they won the penalty.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about LaFleur knowing Aaron Rodgers can get out of any mess and the decision to punt to maintain a lead is not stated. However, it does not provide any information on what should be stated instead. It simply negates part of the current answer without offering a clear direction for improvement.

**Critique**: The two clauses counter each other - the first is a reason to broaden, whereas the second is a reason to backpedal. The second clause answers the question better, so remove the first.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What draws the narrator away from the beach?

**Answer**: The lacerations on the narrator's torso and the smell of cooking food draw the narrator away from the beach. It's not until they come face to face with Calypso that they decide to stay on Ogygia.

**Critique**: The lacerations don't seem to impact the narrator's decision

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the lacerations do not influence the narrator's decision to leave the beach. This implies that the part of the answer mentioning the lacerations should be removed or revised. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement by focusing on the smell of cooking food as the primary reason for the narrator being drawn away from the beach. Therefore, the answer can be improved by removing the mention of lacerations and emphasizing the smell of cooking food.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about fascism?

**Answer**: The professors defining fascism include theories of intellectual superiority and the suppression of ideas through street violence. They say fascism is the idea of one group being better than another, and that only their ideas should be tolerated, which is exactly what the protesters at Lewis & Clark attempted to do.

**Critique**: Students hurled the ever-popular epithet at a renowned scholar in an attempt to intimidate her. The intimidation worked when the dean intervened and cut the scholar's speech short. Include this use of the term 'fascism' in the response.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about an event where the term 'fascism' was used, which can be directly incorporated into the answer. It mentions that students used the term to intimidate a scholar, and this intimidation led to the dean cutting the scholar's speech short.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about fascism?

**Answer**: The article argues that recent college protests have shown that students cannot engage with ideas and are relatively uneducated, resulting in a greater peril in society. The article cites a lack of proper education to explain students' inability to engage with new ideas, particularly about fascism.

**Critique**: Students' inability to engage with new ideas is illustrated by them incorrectly hurling the all-purpose and ever-popular epithet 'fascist' at a renowned scholar to intimidate. They achieved their purpose when her speech was cut short by the dean. Include this incorrect term in the response as proof of the students' peril.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about how students incorrectly used the term "fascist" to intimidate a scholar, which led to the scholar's speech being cut short.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about fascism?

**Answer**: The article describes students who resorted to insults and disruptions to silence a guest speaker with ideas that differed from theirs. The word "fascist" is used as an epithet, indicating that the students are poorly-prepared to engage with ideas. The article also observes that universities have abandoned the ideal of exposing students to the "best which has been thought and said," which leads to ignorance of the importance of free speech. In the article, fascism is interpreted as an epithet used to shout down those with different opinions and to pre-emptively undermine the possibility of an intellectually rigorous discussion.

**Critique**: 'Fascism' is used as an all-purpose and ever-popular epithet by students according to the author of this article. The author also encourages students to look up the definition of fascism and describes fascists as engaged in street brawls and causing disruptions to forestall debate. Change the description of fascism and the use of it in the response to better reflect that of the article.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about how the article describes fascism, including the suggestion that students should look up its definition and the depiction of fascists as engaging in street brawls and causing disruptions. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by incorporating these details into the description of how the article portrays fascism.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about fascism?

**Answer**: Charlotte Hays feels in hindsight that taking up the right to freedom of speach would not be the main priority when it came to why students were shouting down Sommers. She believes the most important reason they were protesting was that they had an lack of education.

**Critique**: Hays felt that the students interrupted Christina Hoff Sommers because they could not handle ideas that differed from their own. The environment created is more inclusive than educational. Remove the current answer because it does not relate to fascism.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about why the students interrupted Christina Hoff Sommers, which is that they could not handle ideas that differed from their own. It also suggests that the environment was more about inclusivity than education. This information allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by focusing on the students' inability to handle differing ideas and the nature of the environment, rather than on freedom of speech or lack of education. Additionally, the critique explicitly states to remove the current answer as it does not relate to fascism, which is a clear directive.

### Sample 970/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article have to say about the state of education at Lewis & Clark College?

**Answer**: The article contends that the state of education at Lewis & Clark College is not adequate enough to enable students to engage in meaningful discussion and debate. The students who were protesting were ill-prepared to do so and disrupt the dialogue. Moreover, the college emphasizes trendy subjects over more rigorous subjects such as constitutional law, corporate law, and criminal law. The overall state of education at Lewis & Clark College is not adequate enough to allow students to engage in discourse.

**Critique**: The law school at the college emphasizes more trendy offerings over duller subjects. Include the 'law school' in the response.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It suggests including the term "law school" to clarify that the critique is specifically about the law school at Lewis & Clark College, rather than the college as a whole.

### Sample 971/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article have to say about the state of education at Lewis & Clark College?

**Answer**: There is a heavy emphasis on trendy specialties like animal, environmental and Indian law. Against this backdrop, it isn't unsurprising that the student base is less concerned with the right to free speech and more with being shielded from differing opinions.

**Critique**: The author feels that the law school does not offer solid preparation, because their trendy offerings are more attractive than duller subjects. End the first sentence with this implication of the emphasis on trendier subjects.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by suggesting an addition to the first sentence. It implies that the emphasis on trendy specialties at Lewis & Clark College's law school results in a lack of solid preparation. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by ending the first sentence with the implication that the focus on trendy subjects detracts from more substantial legal education. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it provides enough information to enhance the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article have to say about the state of education at Lewis & Clark College?

The offering of trendy courses such as animal or environmental law also fails to properly prepare students for a law career. Rather than focusing on being inclusive, the university should be focusing on educating. 

**Critique**: University is spelled incorrectly spelled and incorrectly used. Replace 'univestiry' with Lewis & Clarke Law School.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by correcting the spelling and specifying the correct institution name. It instructs to replace "univestiry" with "Lewis & Clarke Law School," which is a concrete change that can be made without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article have to say about the state of education at Lewis & Clark College?

**Answer**: The article sees the events at Lewis & Clark College as one symptom of a larger problem of American higher education - namely the state of educational preparedness of students entering college. The students at Lewis & Clark are seen as immature and unable to debate ideas in an intelligent way, resorting instead to shouting down scholars and preventing any meaningful discourse. This state of unpreparedness spells trouble for the future of American democracy.

**Critique**: The larger problem in American higher education is the balance between unfettered speech and inclusive environments on campus. The author sees inclusivity as problematic because it does not include everyone and because inclusivity comes at the cost of education and exposure to new ideas. Include this information in the first sentence of the response and remove the last sentence of the response because it is incorrect.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly incorporated into the answer. It suggests including details about the balance between unfettered speech and inclusive environments, as well as the author's view on inclusivity, in the first sentence.

Reviews are also printed which would be an ongoing progress in the advancement of the student's skill.

**Critique**: The Lewis & Clarke Law School markets more trendy offerings, like those mentioned in the response, at the cost of more duller studies that comprise a solid foundation in the study of law. Add this to the response.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the state of education at Lewis & Clark College, specifically that the law school markets trendy offerings at the expense of foundational studies. This information can be directly added to the current answer to improve it by providing a more comprehensive view of the college's educational offerings.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the main news event.

**Answer**: A visiting scholar, Christina Hoff Sommers, was shouted down and ultimately cut off her lecture prematurely by the diversity and inclusion dean at Lewis and Clark College, who observed that the largely peaceful protests against Sommers had become "antsy." This inaction by the dean is indicative of the greater problem of students not prepared to engage in debate and think critically. The focus on freedom of speech misses the more serious threat we are facing: widespread lack of preparedness in higher education.

**Critique**: The dean took action when cutting off Hoff Sommers' prematurely. Change the word to 'intervention'.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by suggesting a change in wording from "inaction" to "intervention."

In a stirring Wednesday night town hall meeting hosted by CNN, the students took Senator Marco Rubio and N.R.A. spokeswoman Dana Loesch to task, demanding gun-control reform.

**Critique**: What the students don't agree with is blaming video games for real-world violence, not a call for a rating system, which already exists.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarise what significant incident occurred at work while Hunter skeptically assumed his night duty.

**Answer**: Hunter was given the night shift at the Distant Detection Array's observation wing at the military base. He was on his way to his post and expressed his disinterest at being assigned the task. His only responsibility is to report unusual feedback from telescopes and sensors, if anything unusual ever comes through. Hunter is convinced that the Array is being used to look for signs of an incoming attack from an extraterrestrial race and not to monitor supernova candidate stars, which is what the public is told.

Hunter started his duty at 11 PM and at 1:07 AM, some sensors at the Array started detecting something in a pocket of seemingly empty space about 17 light years away. One sensor detected an emission of gamma rays, another one detected x rays, which was unusual because an area of empty space is not supposed to emit such radiation. So Hunter decided to take a look with telescopes. He sent instructions to an infrared, visible light, and a radio telescope to survey the area. He was perplexed that both of them showed absolutely nothing even though the radiation levels were reaching the upper limit of what the most powerful stars could emit.

Hunter restarted the sensors and receiving satellites to try to make sure these weren't false readings. As he was waiting for the sensors to come back on, the infrared telescope he pointed at the area gave an alert. It had detected a momentary spike and drop to normal of heat in the area,

**Critique**: Hunter's opinions about his job are irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that Hunter's opinions about his job are irrelevant, which implies that the parts of the answer discussing his disinterest and skepticism should be removed.

**Answer**: Celeste is a good student with great grades who wants to be a lawyer or a businesswoman. She's a heavy drinker who parties at Darcy's. The alcohol makes her feel like she's having fun, but it's actually a beast that's controlling her and she can't escape its grasp. She makes a mistake while trying to fly the stairs at Darcy's and falls, vomiting on the steps above. The beast is now her enemy, and she promises it will never happen again.

**Critique**: The story doesn't say Celeste is a heavy drinker.

**Rationale**: The critique clearly states that the story does not mention Celeste being a heavy drinker. This implies that the part of the answer describing her as a heavy drinker should be removed or corrected. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by eliminating the incorrect statement about her drinking habits.

What does the story say about Celeste's relationship with the drugs and alcohol she took?

**Answer**: Celeste was a good student and had great grades. She was also ambitious and had aspirations of business and law. However, she was a normal teenager who wanted to have fun. She was at a party with her friends and she was having fun. She was drinking and taking drugs. She was having fun until she felt the beast in her stomach. She tried to escape but the beast dragged her back to Vanity Heights.

**Critique**: Celeste's personality and life, in general, aren't relevant to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the details about Celeste's personality and life are not relevant to the question, which asks specifically about her relationship with drugs and alcohol. This implies that the answer should focus more directly on her interactions with drugs and alcohol rather than her academic performance or ambitions. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to improve the answer by removing the irrelevant parts and focusing on her actions and experiences with drugs and alcohol at the party.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about "The Office" set modeled in LEGO?

**Answer**: The proposal is for "The Office" TV show to have a LEGO model set made. The model set will include over 2500 pieces which can split apart into 3 sections. The "The Office" LEGO set also includes a total of 14 minifigures. The LEGO set is accurate to the show, with the dimensions measuring just over 17"x19" and the total piece count coming in at just under 2500.

**Critique**: There is no proposal in the article, it's just the author sharing his "The Office" LEGO project.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that there is no proposal mentioned in the article, but rather, it is the author sharing their own "The Office" LEGO project. This implies that the part of the answer stating "The proposal is for 'The Office' TV show to have a LEGO model set made" should be corrected to reflect that it is the author's project, not a proposal.

**Critique**: While Carville is melancholy about his friend's situation he appears to be relieved. It is not clear from the text what the Letters of Last Resort are regarding. He is nostalgic for his life before being Prime Minister, not during.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections and clarifications that allow for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that Carville is melancholy about his friend's situation, not necessarily about the secret letter. It also specifies that Carville is nostalgic for his life before becoming Prime Minister, not during his tenure. Although the critique mentions that it is unclear what the Letters of Last Resort are regarding, this does not prevent making the other improvements based on the critique.

### Sample 1021/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How did the writer compose the structure of this informative article's narrative?

**Answer**: The writer used three different components to compose this piece's structure: an important background story which is the inception, or beginning of the invention of Scotch masking tape, the salient details of Richard Drew's life and his work in the University, and the invention of the Scotch tape itself, from inception to conceptualization and the successful release to the populace.

**Critique**: The response states the different components but does not do so in the order they appear.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the components mentioned in the answer are not listed in the order they appear in the narrative.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How did the writer compose the structure of this informative article's narrative?

**Answer**: The narrative structure of the informative article follows an origin story centered around Richard Drew and the invention of Scotch tape. The story begins with introducing Drew and explaining the situation in which he made the invention of the tape. The narrative of the article progresses by detailing Drew's method of experimentation and eventual success with the creation of Scotch tape. The article concludes with a brief overview of its success and how it got its name.

**Critique**: The response does not mention the development of Scotch masking tape.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is missing information about the development of Scotch masking tape. This implies that the narrative structure should include details about this aspect. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by adding a section that discusses the development of Scotch masking tape as part of the narrative structure. This would involve inserting a sentence or two about how the development of Scotch masking tape fits into the progression of the story, likely between Drew's experimentation and the success of Scotch tape.

### Sample 1024/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How did the writer compose the structure of this informative article's narrative?

**Answer**: The opening hook of the article teases the origin of the Scotch tape branding. With the reader now interested in the tale, the article proceeds to talk about the inventor of scotch tape, how the tape was invented, and what the inventor did later in their career. Once the entire narrative is finished, it is only then that the writer chooses to resolve original teaser -using its incomplete anecdotal tale as the concluding part of the narrative. By itself, the origin of the Scotch name makes for an interesting hook, but not a satisfying story due to the fact that the information it provides is inconclusive: the story being told is only supposed information. The strongest statement in the opening paragraph may as well be an outright falsification: that the origin of the name is as interesting as the origin of the product itself. So it can be said that the writer of the article turned a mediocre story into an interesting hook for a tale about 3M's Richard Drew.

**Critique**: The response includes unnecessary conjecture and analysis of the article's structure.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response includes unnecessary conjecture and analysis of the article's structure. However, it does not specify which parts are conjecture or analysis, nor does it provide guidance on what should be included instead. Without specific information on what is unnecessary or what should replace it, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the intended structure of the article. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why was Paul Ryan unwilling to partake in any measure to constrain Donald Trump?

**Answer**: Ryan is unwilling to take any measure that will cross Trump. This is because it would cause a rift between Trump and the Republicans.

**Critique**: The response is inaccurate. Any measure to constrain Trump would provoke a major fight with him and his massive pro-Trump base before the upcoming midterm elections. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about why Paul Ryan was unwilling to constrain Donald Trump, mentioning the potential for a major fight with Trump and his pro-Trump base before the midterm elections. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by replacing the original reasoning with the one provided in the critique. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it gives enough information to improve the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

Why was Paul Ryan unwilling to partake in any measure to constrain Donald Trump?

**Answer**: He was afraid of a backlash from Trump's supporters that might jeopardize the upcoming midterm elections.

**Critique**: Needs to add some details about Ryan's refusal to constrain Trump.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer needs to add some details about Ryan's refusal to constrain Trump, but it does not provide any specific details or information that can be added. Without additional information or specific details from the source material, it is not possible to improve the answer. The critique does not imply or suggest any specific content that can be added to the answer, so the editor would need to refer back to the source material to know what details to include.

**Answer**: He hosted and curated the X-Posure All Dayer, hosted and curated the X-Posure Summer Party, and hosted the latest output from In The Woods, the music production podcast Tape Notes.

**Critique**: Remove the part about In The Woods - this is since 2017, out of the question's scope.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what part of the answer is incorrect and why it should be removed. It clearly states that the mention of "In The Woods" is outside the scope of the question, which focuses on events between 2009-2016. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the part about "In The Woods" without needing to refer back to the source material.

What kind of programming does Radio X focus on?

**Answer**: Radio X focuses on new music, primarily from alternative and indie styles.

**Critique**: Kennedy's show focuses on this, not the radio station as a whole, for which there is no information.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the information provided in the answer is specific to Kennedy's show and not representative of the entire radio station's programming. However, it does not provide any information about what the radio station as a whole focuses on. Therefore, I cannot improve the answer without going back to the source material to find out what the overall programming of Radio X includes.

### Sample 1029/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about what John's passionate about?

**Answer**: John is passionate about music. He is the presenter of X-Posure, a new music show on Radio X, and he has been credited with discovering countless musicians who have gone on to find success. He is also the host of Tape Notes, a music production podcast in which artists are reunited with producers to discuss their work together in the studio.

**Critique**: The first sentence is fair to surmise, but the second and third sentences are irrelevant when the context of the whole article is John's work in music.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the second and third sentences are irrelevant to the question of what John is passionate about, which is music. This implies that the answer should focus solely on John's passion for music without detailing his specific roles or achievements. Therefore, the improved answer would simply state that John is passionate about music, omitting the details about his work on Radio X and the Tape Notes podcast. This can be done without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides clear guidance on what to remove.

### Sample 1030/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about cyberbullying?

**Answer**: The text doesn't say much about cyberbullying, but it can be inferred that cyberbullying is the act of taunting or bullying someone through the internet or computer. Cyberbullying is a crime in New York, but the law defining it is vague and leaves a lot of room for interpretation. The New York Senate came up with a solution in SB2318A, but it is vague and leaves a lot of room for interpretation.

**Critique**: The answer needlessly repeats the vagueness of the law.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer repeats the information about the vagueness of the law, which suggests that the repetition should be removed to improve the answer. This is a specific and actionable suggestion that allows for a concrete improvement without needing to refer back to the source material. By removing the redundant mention of the law's vagueness, the answer can be made more concise and focused.

### Sample 1031/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the New York Senate's approach to lawmaking. 

**Answer**: The New York Senate came up with a solution in SB2318A. The bill is 12-A. Cyberbullying. 1. AS USED IN THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS: A. MINOR SHALL MEAN ANY NATURAL PERSON OR INDIVIDUAL UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. B. PERSON SHALL MEAN ANY NATURAL PERSON OR INDIVIDUAL. 2. ANY PERSON WHO KNOWINGLY ENGAGES IN A REPEATED COURSE OF CYBERBULLYING OF A MINOR SHALL BE GUILTY OF AN UNCLASSIFIED MISDEMEANOR PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF NOT MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS, OR BY A PERIOD OF IMPRISONMENT NOT TO EXCEED ONE YEAR, OR BY BOTH SUCH FINE AND IMPRISONMENT. 3. This act shall take effect immediately. Notice anything missing there? No definition of cyberbullying. Not a good one. Not a bad one. None at all. It’s a misdemeanor to engage in a “repeated course of cyberbullying,” but what that might be is anyone’s guess. The Senate's approach is to leave a huge, gaping hole for prosecutors to fill.

**Critique**: The article doesn't discuss New York Senate's approach to lawmaking at all.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the article does not discuss the New York Senate's approach to lawmaking, which implies that the current answer is not relevant to the question. However, the critique does not provide any information or guidance on what the New York Senate's approach to lawmaking actually is. Therefore, without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to improve the answer to accurately reflect the New York Senate's approach to lawmaking.

### Sample 1032/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the historical context around the news event.

**Answer**: The New York Senate recently passed a bill criminalizing cyberbullying. In doing so, the bill does not specifically define what cyberbullying is, which is confusing for most as it does not specify if cyberbullying can be done against minors or not. It seems that the legislators are passing the bill to try to appear concerned about the youth without actually taking action to protect them.

**Critique**: There is no discussion of a historical context for the law in the article.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer does not address the historical context of the news event, which is the focus of the question. However, it does not provide any information or implications about what the historical context might be. Without additional details or guidance on what the historical context entails, it is not possible to improve the answer solely based on the critique. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Answer**: The ban is intended to spread people’s outdoor time more evenly throughout the day while curbing the spread of COVID-19. The lockdown in France has been instituted to prevent an outbreak of the virus. With the disease continuing to spread, there's a concern that not enough people are abiding by necessary social distancing measures. The daytime ban is intended to spread people’s outdoor time more evenly while curbing the spread of the virus.

**Critique**: The first sentence is sufficient

**Rationale**: The critique states that the first sentence is sufficient, which implies that the rest of the answer is unnecessary. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by keeping only the first sentence and removing the rest. Therefore, the critique allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said the move is about spreading people's outdoor time evenly throughout the day by increasing time taken up by the ban. She added that the daytime ban will decrease citywide health risks.

**Critique**: "by increasing time taken up by the ban" is confusing

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific part of the answer that is confusing, which implies that this part should be clarified or rephrased. However, it does not provide enough information on how to clarify or what the correct phrasing should be. Without additional context or information from the source material, it is not possible to determine the intended meaning or how to improve this part of the answer.

Other countries, such as the Czech Republic, have implemented a mask requirement. Some countries, like Denmark and Austria, will reopen schools and small shops next week while Germany has a plan in place to phase in a step-by-step return to normality. Given this, it is clear that countries throughout Europe are taking different approaches to dealing with the virus.

**Critique**: Remove inaccurate and unnecessary information

**Rationale**: The critique states to "remove inaccurate and unnecessary information," but it does not specify which parts of the answer are inaccurate or unnecessary. Without knowing which specific details are incorrect or superfluous, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique does not provide enough information to determine what should be removed or corrected, and thus, I would need to refer back to the source material to identify inaccuracies or unnecessary details.

**Critique**: Doesn't mention the military tunnels. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer should include information about military tunnels, which are relevant to Primož's strategic importance. This implies that the presence of military tunnels is a key aspect of its strategic significance. Therefore, I can improve the answer by adding a mention of military tunnels as part of Primož's strategic features, without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: The year for the gubernatorial election is inaccurate. This article discusses the New York gubernatorial election for 2018, not 2019.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the correct year of the gubernatorial election, changing it from 2019 to 2018. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the year without needing to refer back to the source material.

Summarize the typical turnout for Libertarian candidates and their place in the political lineup. 

**Answer**: The typical turnout for a Libertarian candidate is about four million New Yorkers, who are not be the decisive factor in deciding the winner of the gubernatorial race. The only two elections in which a single state candidate not running on the Democrat or Republican ticket has come close to finishing in second place were both in the Civil war era.

**Critique**: The answer omits that third-party candidates have rarely been competitive in New York’s gubernatorial races. 


**Rationale**: The critique provides additional context about the competitiveness of third-party candidates, specifically mentioning that they have rarely been competitive in New York's gubernatorial races. This information can be directly incorporated into the answer to improve it by highlighting the typical performance and challenges faced by Libertarian candidates in the political lineup. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1042/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what this piece has to say about the larger context of voter demographics in the United States. 

**Answer**: The demographics seem to somewhat favor left-leaning individuals and candidates. This has been firmly established in New York as several Democratic governors have been elected by the people of the state. Deterred Republicans in the state of New York no longer vote for candidates who are not their own. President Trump is a prominent example of this Republican voter phenomenon. Candidates often create niche-brands that students of marketing would quickly pick up based on an evaluation of the demonstrated behavior and habits of a certain sector of the electorate. Larry Sharpe wants to be the candidate not for Republicans, but for Libertarians, an underdog party in New York state. He wants to create a niche-brand for the interests of neoconservative, populist conservatives and independents.

**Critique**: This answer is made up and extrinsic. The text does not discuss demographics or the larger context of voter demographics in the United States. This answer should be "no answer."


**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer does not accurately reflect the content of the source material, as it states that the text does not discuss demographics or the larger context of voter demographics in the United States. The critique suggests that the correct answer should be "no answer," implying that the source material does not provide information on the topic in question.

**Answer**: While a lack of clarity might be the key reason, a portion of it may be due to the fact that "traditional values" are not quite so popular anymore while it seems the younger generation is more liberal and tolerant.

**Critique**: The answer is made up and cannot be attested in the text.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is "made up and cannot be attested in the text," but it does not provide any specific information or corrections that would allow for an improvement of the answer. It simply negates the current answer without offering any guidance on what the correct or supported reasons for dissonance might be. Therefore, without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to improve the answer based solely on the critique.

The queen tries to float on the lifeboat, but the water keeps distracting her from paying attention to the boat. She feels something brushing against her and turns around to see a massive water dragon lift up her infant, Allene. The dragon swims to an island called Farlig Dyr where she places the mother and babe and keeps them both dry.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the climactic event of the story.

**Answer**: The climactic event occurs when there is a firestorm on a hunting ship full of royalty. In the feverish chaos, a woman being prepared to be saved on a lifeboat accidentally drops her baby in a sea which then is rescued by a dragon. When the dragon decides to take the baby to her nest, the woman watches in horror noticing the life boat will have had reached her by now and might have saved her if it hadn't been for the dragon. The dragon then allows the woman to take this moment to contemplate the mistake of abandoning her child.

**Critique**: It was a storm, not a fire storm. The lightning caused the fires. 

The queen does not drop her baby in the sea, they both fall into the sea. She later loses strength in her arms and asks the dragon to save the baby.

The queen does not make a realization that the lifeboat would have gotten to her in time.

The dragon had not affected the amount of time for the lifeboat to reach the queen. It was the queen who willingly gives the baby to the dragon. 

The dragon immediately leaves with the baby when the lifeboat approaches, the queen's horror is in thinking that her baby drowned (the dragon did not explain it would use a protective barrier to keep the child safe underwater).

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections and additional details that allow for a concrete improvement of the answer. It clarifies that the event was a storm with lightning causing fires, corrects the sequence of events regarding the queen and her baby, and provides the accurate emotional response and actions of the characters involved. With these details, the answer can be revised to accurately reflect the climactic event without needing to refer back to the source material.

Summarize how the queen changes over the story.

**Answer**: The queen initially begins the story terrified and desperate, but eventually resigns herself to the idea that her child has been taken by the waves and drowned. She wakes up later to find her child being protected by a dragon. Despite her initial objection, the queen eventually realizes that her child is now in good hands and feels gratitude towards the dragon. Over the course of the story, the queen gradually comes to realize that while parts of her life have been lost, she still has something precious in her child which must be protected at all costs.

**Critique**: The response does not reflect what is in the summary. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response does not reflect what is in the summary, but it does not provide any specific information or guidance on how to correct or improve the answer. Without knowing what the summary actually contains, it is impossible to determine what aspects of the answer are incorrect or how they should be adjusted.

### Sample 1049/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize how the queen changes over the story.

**Answer**: The queen changes significantly over the course of the story. She starts off as a mother concerned for her child's safety in the middle of a storm. She turns to despair when her child is taken by a dragon. With the arrival of the king and the subsequent events, the queen becomes more determined and focused on ensuring her child's safety. She becomes more courageous and resilient as she faces challenges. At the end of the story, the queen becomes determined to keep her child safe, despite the opposition it faces.

**Critique**: the changes in the queen after the arrival of the king is wrong in the response. Also, the child is not taken by the dragon, instead, the queen gives the child to the dragon.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It indicates that the part about the child being taken by the dragon is incorrect and should be changed to reflect that the queen gives the child to the dragon. Additionally, it mentions that the changes in the queen after the arrival of the king are wrong, which implies that this part of the answer needs to be revised. However, the critique does not specify what the correct changes are after the king's arrival, so that part cannot be improved without additional information from the source material.

### Sample 1050/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize how the queen changes over the story.

**Answer**: Initially we see the queen reacting to the ship being hit by lightning and fire. She drops her child and falls into the water, screaming out for her child to be saved. Later her child is taken by a water dragon, who places the child on an island. The queen sinks into the water, exhausted and helpless. She is hauled into the life boat but is inconsolable to the point that she is actively making the process of rescuing her and her child a lot more difficult.

**Critique**: There is no mention of trying to retrieve the child from the water dragon, if anything it is implied that the queen has assumed that the child has drowned. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer does not mention any attempt by the queen to retrieve the child from the water dragon, and it implies that the queen assumes the child has drowned. This suggests that the answer should be adjusted to reflect the queen's assumption about the child's fate rather than any active attempt to retrieve the child. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to improve the answer by clarifying the queen's reaction and assumption about her child's fate.

The child is returned to the dragon and the queen falls and nearly drowns, but is rescued by the king. The ship is lost in the sinking.

**Critique**: Everything after the first sentence is not related to the ship.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that everything after the first sentence is not related to the ship, which implies that the rest of the answer should be removed to focus solely on the ship's fate.

The dragon under the water saved the infant from the waves and took her to her home on Farlig Dyre. The king and the rest of the crew made it safely to shore.

**Critique**: The wave crashed into the ship, but did not sink it. The last two sentences are not about the ship.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for concrete improvements to the answer. It clarifies that the wave did not sink the ship, which means the part of the answer stating "The ship was taken down by waves" should be corrected.

Summarize what happened to the ship.

**Answer**: A storm came and because the sails were taken down, the ship became a sitting duck. A lighting sawn started a fire, and another bolt hit near the stern and kindled the fire. The captain ordered that they abandon ship but while most of the crew left the ship in a life boat, Queen Melein got separated from the boat. A large wave pushed her into the water and she struggled to stay afloat, losing her grip on her daughter. A large dragon used its breath to spread a barrier near the royal pair and lifted them out of the water and moved them to safety at Farlig Dyre Island.

**Critique**: Queen's name is not given in the story. The last two sentences are not about the boat. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer. It indicates that the name "Queen Melein" should be removed because it is not mentioned in the story, and it suggests that the last two sentences should be removed because they do not pertain to the ship. With this information, I can revise the answer to focus solely on the events related to the ship without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what happened to the ship.

**Answer**: The ship is caught in a storm. The crew attempt to sail away from the storm but the lightning catches the main mast. Prom near where the queen and king stood, a bolt hits the ship. These strikes cause a fire that the crew members cannot put out. The captain grounds the boat and loads people into the life boats. However, the currents throw the boat off course and the queen and her child are thrown into the ocean.

**Critique**: The crew's plan for the storm is to wait it out, not to sail away. Also, the boat is not mentioned to be taken off course.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections to the current answer. It states that the crew's plan is to wait out the storm rather than sail away, and it clarifies that the boat is not mentioned to be taken off course. With this information, I can improve the answer by changing the crew's action from attempting to sail away to waiting out the storm and removing the part about the boat being taken off course.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what happened to the ship.

**Answer**: Waves tossed the ship about during a severe storm at sea. The rain came down in torrents and sails were taken down when the decision was made to wait out the storm. Lightning hit the main mast and the thunder could wake the dead. Deckhands scrambled to put out the fire while lightning strikes the stern; the ship was a lost cause. Life boats were called as the queen and her baby was tossed over the side. The ship was abandoned.

**Critique**: The wording of the response is disjointed.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the wording of the response is disjointed, but it does not provide specific guidance on how to improve the wording or which parts are disjointed.

**Answer**: Spain has an outright ban on outdoor exercise. The Czech Republic has had to wear facemasks outside at all times by law, but can from today leave home without one. Denmark and Austria, which were two of the first European countries to go into lockdown, will start a slow exit from next week. Denmark will reopen nurseries and primary schools from April 15, while Austria will allow small shops, DIY stores and garden centers to open from April 14. The German government has drawn up an action plan to phase in a step-by-step return to normality, including mandatory mask-wearing in public, limits on gatherings and the rapid tracing of infection chains, according to Reuters.

What does the text say about damage types?

**Answer**: There are three physical damage types: Impact, Puncture, and Slash. Physical damage come in ten elemental damage types: four base elements and the six combinations formed by modding two elements together. Elemental damage types are stronger or weaker versus certain enemy types. The physical damage types also have "status effects" that can be applied via a "procedural random chance" percentage, often known as procs. Impact procs make enemies suffer a dramatic stagger, Puncture procs reduce enemies' damage output by a flat 30%, and Slash procs inflict "bleed" damage over time. Slash is considered the most powerful procs from all of the physical damage types.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the process of leveling the field? 

**Answer**: The text's author says they were inspired by Khora, the next warframe and so something from the update will adjust physical damage in broad terms by changing the way impact, puncture, and slash damage affect enemy enemies. Adjustments will make impacts and punctures scale in effectiveness based on the damage of the weapon that causes it. The main improvement is that the percentages won't refresh but scale rather than hunt for additional percentage points.

**Critique**: Slash damage will not be reworked. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It states that "slash damage will not be reworked," which directly contradicts the current answer's implication that all three types of damage (impact, puncture, and slash) will be adjusted. Using this critique, I can revise the answer to accurately reflect that only impact and puncture damage will be adjusted, not slash damage. This allows for a concrete improvement without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: Physical damage has three types, impact, puncture and slash, introduced to the forefront of arsenals for modding and weapon diversity. There are also ten elemental damage types, consisting of base elements which are either affected by thrust or bullet weapons. These damage types have their corresponding "status effects" which can be applied to the enemies. Status procs have a "procedural random chance" percentage, which is typically referred to as "procs". Status effects can cause an enemy to stagger, reducing damage output by a flat 30%, inflicted by the puncture proc or inflicting "bleed" damage over time, inflicted by the slash proc. Previous to the changes, both puncture and impact had no scaling while slash procs did stack. After the make adjustments, with impact, puncture and slash, they all can scale in effectiveness, based on the damage dealt.

### Sample 1090/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about damage-scaling procs?

**Answer**: Since Damage 2.0, physical damage has three types (Impact, Puncture and Slash, often referred to as IPS) brought to the forefront of Arsenals for modding and weapon diversity. In an update coming soon, all IPS status effects will scale in effectiveness, based on the damage dealt. To do this, Impact and Puncture procs -cause enemies to stagger, and reduce damage output by a flat 30% respectively- will scale in effectiveness based on the damage dealt and they also refresh duration of the proc.

**Critique**: The response contains inaccurate information.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response contains inaccurate information but does not specify what is inaccurate or provide any guidance on what the correct information should be. Without knowing which parts of the answer are incorrect or what the accurate information is, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer.

In an update coming soon, all IPS status effects will scale in effectiveness, based on the damage dealt. To do this, Impact and Puncture procs -cause enemies to stagger, and reduce damage output by a flat 30% respectively- will scale in effectiveness based on the damage dealt at the time of the proc. Basically, procs with lower damage outputs will have shorter effects, and procs with high damage outputs will have longer effect durations. This makes it more fair for all weapon types.

**Critique**: The response contains inaccurate information.

### Sample 1092/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about damage-scaling procs?

**Answer**: In order to better players to perform large-amount damage with weapons, status-assisting procs will now scale in effectiveness the more damage they do. Status-assisted procs will scale from no effectiveness all the way up to a ragdoll. This means the scaling damage system will deal maximal damage to enemies that are highly vulnerable, and has no benefit to those that would have none by increasing said damage further.

**Critique**: The response could use clearer language.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the language in the answer should be clearer, but it does not provide specific guidance on how to achieve this clarity. Without additional information or examples of clearer language, it is not possible to concretely improve the answer. The critique does not specify which parts of the language are unclear or suggest alternative phrasing, so the editor would need to refer back to the source material to understand the intended meaning and make the language clearer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the companies final intentions?

**Answer**: From a mechanical standpoint, the author states that their final intentions were to address long-term business objectives. This certainly has been proven with the buff to the interplay between physical and elemental abilities. The third part of that was a post release on elemental abilities, showing a long-term goal to improve the overall gameplay.

Summarize the climactic event of the story.

**Answer**: The narrator and Victor go sledding. They make a jump out of snow and go flying off of it. They soar over the snow for about ten feet.

**Critique**: This isn't the climax of the story. There is no real clear climax, but it could be seen as when the passenger asks the narrator why he thinks that is the best day he's ever had. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the provided answer does not describe the climax of the story and suggests an alternative event that could be considered the climax. However, it does not provide enough specific information about the alternative event to allow for a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique mentions a passenger asking the narrator a question, but without additional context or details, it is not possible to rewrite the answer to accurately reflect this as the climactic event.

The narrator explains that the day was so special because they were just a pair of fourth-graders having fun and there were no adults around. The narrator also explains that there was no way for anyone to be better or worse than the next guy. The tension is also between the narrator and the interviewer.

**Critique**: Specify that the question comes from a passenger of the narrator's.

He says that the real difference between someone in the front of the cab and someone in the back of the cab is luck. He says that there is no way to be measured as a cab driver.

**Critique**: This is false. the narrator does feel measured against others as a cab driver. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the statement "there is no way to be measured as a cab driver" is incorrect because the narrator does feel measured against others. This implies that the answer should be adjusted to reflect that the narrator does have a sense of being measured or compared to others in his role as a cab driver. The critique provides enough information to make this specific change without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: The text doesn't say the 1919 Australia tour was the first tour for the New Zealand rugby team.

**Rationale**: The critique points out an inaccuracy in the answer regarding the New Zealand rugby team's tour history. However, it does not provide the correct information about the tour's significance or what made Arthur Matthews a player of note. Without additional details from the source material, I cannot determine what specific aspect of the tour or Matthews' career should be highlighted to accurately convey why he was a player of note.

### Sample 1107/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the symbolism of food in this story.

**Answer**: There are two kinds of food in this story: real food and condiments. The real food is the food that the characters use to satiate their hunger, such as the apples, carrots, hot dogs, and soup. The condiments are the ketchup and Sriracha, which are used to add flavor to the food. The condiments are what give the food its color, and they are also what keep the kitchen door closed.

**Critique**: There is no evidence to suggest that the condiments give the food its color and that it keeps the kitchen door closed.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that there is no evidence to support the claims about condiments giving food its color and keeping the kitchen door closed. This implies that these parts of the answer should be removed or revised. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by removing the unsupported statements about the condiments. The revised answer would focus on the real food and its role in satiating hunger, without making unsubstantiated claims about the condiments.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the singular source of tension in the story and how it is resolved. 

**Answer**: The singular source of tension in the story is the fridge door that refused to stay shut. The fridge door would tease them by feigning closure, then mockingly swing open. The fridge drove the housemates insane. They took the drawers and the shelfs out to readjust the magnetic strips. Nothing worked. The fridge would recurrently switch its magnetic strip to repel mode. It was not until later that my housemate figured out the cause. The ketchup bottle was the singular source of tension in the story and how it was resolved. The ketchup bottle was the singular source of tension in the story and how it was resolved. It was the ketchup bottle that made the fridge door refuse to stay shut.

**Critique**: The response includes extraneous information not useful for the task.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer contains unnecessary details that do not contribute to summarizing the singular source of tension and its resolution. However, it does not specify which parts are extraneous or what should be retained. Without guidance on which information is extraneous, I cannot determine how to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the essential elements of the tension and its resolution.

He also needs a lot of help with basic tasks, and it's the job of the squire to provide it.

**Critique**: Perry's knight isn't lazy. He's lousy.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the knight is "lousy" rather than "lazy." This correction can be directly applied to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The editor can change the word "lazy" to "lousy" in the answer, which is a specific and actionable change.

**Critique**: Mumford calls the first seven chapters suitable for an undergraduate, who are novices in the field.

**Rationale**: The critique provides information that the first seven chapters are suitable for undergraduates, who are considered novices. This implies that the chapters beyond the first seven exceed the abilities of a novice. Therefore, the critique allows us to improve the answer by indicating that chapters beyond the first seven are the ones that exceed novice abilities.

Daniel thinks that it looks like melted ice cream. The voices behind the machine tell Daniel that they are messengers, that the creature is one of those who represent them. The creature is multiple creatures and they are here as messengers. It says that Daniel's emissions are a beacon to something or someone dangerous.

**Critique**: Lacking movement only applies to the beginning, so this sentence can be rephrased to reflect that it's situational.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by indicating that the description of the creature lacking movement is only applicable at the beginning. This implies that the sentence should be rephrased to reflect that the lack of movement is situational. Therefore, I can improve the answer by modifying the sentence to indicate that the creature initially lacks movement but this may change later.

**Critique**: The last two sentences can be inferred from the text but are not explicitly stated and so exceed the question's scope.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the last two sentences of the answer are not explicitly stated in the source material and therefore should be removed to stay within the scope of the question. This implies a concrete action: remove the last two sentences to improve the answer. The critique provides enough information to make this change without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: Remove the second clause of the second sentence, as it's not supported by the text.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the second clause of the second sentence should be removed because it is not supported by the text. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by removing the specific part of the sentence that is not supported. Therefore, I can make a concrete improvement to the answer by deleting the clause "but Daniel and the others don't believe it" from the second sentence.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the narrator's relationship with Melanie?

**Answer**: The narrator admits to being careless and unaware of the details about Melanie, despite the fact that they see each other every day. The narrator interacts with Melanie in a condescending, rude manner and does not seem to care about how their words might affect Melanie. The relationship between the narrator and Melanie is unprofessional and disrespectful.

**Critique**: It's an honest mistake the narrator makes, not malice or animosity between them. Admittedly, the mistake is horrible 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the narrator's actions are not driven by malice or animosity, but rather by an honest mistake. This implies that the relationship might not be as negative as described in the original answer. The critique provides enough information to adjust the tone of the relationship from being described as "unprofessional and disrespectful" to one where the narrator's actions are more of an unfortunate oversight rather than intentional rudeness. Therefore, the critique allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by softening the description of the narrator's behavior towards Melanie.

What does the story say about the narrator's relationship with Melanie?

**Answer**: There doesn't seem to be a relationship between Melanie and the narrator. The narrator is just too wishy washy to attempt a real conversation with Melanie.

**Critique**: That is an odd interpretation of the narrator's reticence to get to know their co-worker due to the transitory nature of the space

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the narrator's reluctance to engage with Melanie is due to the temporary nature of their environment, rather than a lack of interest or indecisiveness. This implies that the answer should be revised to reflect this context. The critique provides enough information to improve the answer by focusing on the transitory nature of the space as the reason for the narrator's behavior, without needing to refer back to the source material.

Melanie occasionally exchanges gestures (glances and nods) with the narrator. The narrator developed a crush on Melanie, but he never took the initiative to talk to her.

**Critique**: The narrator did not develop a crush

**Rationale**: The critique states that "The narrator did not develop a crush," which directly contradicts a specific part of the answer. This implies that the part about the narrator developing a crush on Melanie should be removed or corrected. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete change to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1123/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the narrator's relationship with Melanie?

**Answer**: The narrator describes Melanie as someone who is physically distanced from him. He admits that he knows little about her and doesn't pay her much attention. He seems dismissive and disparaging of her, causing her to react badly to him. The relationship between the two seems unfriendly and adversarial.

**Critique**: It's a bit less serious than that, he just gets her name wrong

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the narrator's relationship with Melanie is not as unfriendly or adversarial as the current answer implies. Instead, the critique indicates that the main issue is that the narrator simply gets her name wrong, which is a less serious mistake. This implies that the relationship might be more casual or less significant than described. Therefore, the answer can be improved by downplaying the adversarial tone and focusing on the narrator's mistake regarding Melanie's name. This can be done without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: This verb should be in the 3rd person present active tense rather than the infinitive 

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that a verb should be in the 3rd person present active tense rather than the infinitive. This implies that there is a specific verb in the answer that needs to be changed to fit this grammatical requirement. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can identify the verb "address" in the sentence "he wants to order a juice and address her with 'Bok Choy'" as the one that should be changed to "addresses" to match the 3rd person present active tense. This is a concrete improvement that can be made directly from the critique.

Summarize the relationship between Hermann's childhood and his lifestyle to mountain climbing.

**Answer**: Hermann Hess Helfenstein was born in a mountainous area in Switzerland. His parents ran a hotel, so he was raised in the mountains. His father was also a mountain guide, so he learned to climb with him.

**Critique**: The answer should mention Hermann's climbing career.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should include information about Hermann's climbing career, but it does not provide specific details about what aspects of his career should be mentioned. Without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to improve the answer by adding details about his climbing career. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything related to the president.

**Answer**: The President of the United States called Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg to inform him that the United States was preparing to ground the 737 MAX aircraft. This follows confirmation that newly analyzed satellite data and crash evidence show some similarities between two recent crashes of the 737 MAX 8.

**Critique**: The last line does not pertain to the president.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the last line of the answer does not pertain to the president, which implies that it should be removed to improve the focus on the president's actions. This is a clear directive that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. By removing the last line, the answer will be more aligned with the question's focus on summarizing everything related to the president.

France's air accident investigation agency plans to analyze the black-box and data recorders from the crashed plane. Germany's BFU declined a request to handle to evidence, as it could not process the new type of recorder the jets used. Canada also grounded 737 MAX jets. Brazil, Mexico, and Panama became the first Latin American nations to suspend the planes. 

**Critique**: The answer should mention the crash in Indonesia.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the answer should include information about the crash in Indonesia. This provides a clear directive to add a specific piece of information to the existing answer. Therefore, I can improve the answer by including a mention of the crash in Indonesia without needing to refer back to the source material.

Several nations, including China, Europe, and Indonesia, have halted flights of the 737 MAX since Sunday's crash. In Latin America, Panama and Copa Airlines have suspended operations of the 737 MAX 9.

**Critique**: The first line should mention the specific crash in Ethiopia.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests adding specific information about a crash in Ethiopia to the first line of the answer. However, it does not provide enough information about the crash itself, such as the date or details, which would be necessary to make a concrete improvement to the answer. Without access to the source material, I cannot accurately add this information to the answer. Therefore, I cannot improve the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

**Critique**: There is no evidence that Perry is forced to serve his master.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that there is no evidence supporting the claim that Perry is forced to serve his master. This implies that the part of the answer stating "he is forced to serve his master" should be removed or revised. However, the critique does not provide any information on what should replace this statement or how to accurately describe Perry's situation without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the story's setting.

**Answer**: The story appears to take place in an online multiplayer game or it as an online reality, since the King can die. In this world, the King seems to be a Minecraft figurine, and has a lot of dogs. The world has a castle, mines and a village. The King goes so far as to say that the world isn't real and that there is another life after he dies. This could mean the world ends when players quit, or that all across many worlds, players are reborn in the one, and this is their life after the next.

**Critique**: The passage does not say that the setting of the story is online or in an online reality. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the setting being described as "online" or "in an online reality" is not supported by the passage. This implies that the mention of an online setting should be removed or revised. However, the critique does not provide an alternative description of the setting or suggest what the correct setting might be. Therefore, without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to accurately revise the setting description.

### Sample 1135/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the story's setting.

**Answer**: The story takes place in a village made up of small shacks. King Steve built a castle, inside which the narrator learns that the King is a player character in the game Minecraft. The narrator spends a lot of time with King Steve, exploring the game's world and learning how to manipulate game objects. The game experience appears to be immersive because the game world is much richer and more beautiful than the narrator's rather drab world. King Steve says that players leave a permanent trace in the game when they die, since becoming a player means dying within the game. The only amenity missing from the game world is human presence, off-screen, which King Steve cannot recreate. However, other characters may appear at any time, even sporadically. King Steve and his kingdom are protected by players, and King Steve has been a multi-time king because he was the first king who found another kingdom.

**Critique**: The passage does not mention anything about a human presence that is off-screen.

**Rationale**: The critique specifically points out that the mention of a "human presence that is off-screen" is incorrect. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing or correcting this part of the description. The critique provides enough information to make this change without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: The passage does not indicate that the story takes place in an online multiplayer game. 

**Rationale**: The critique clearly states that the story does not take place in an online multiplayer game, which implies that the setting described in the answer is incorrect. To improve the answer, I would remove the part about the story taking place in an online multiplayer game. However, the critique does not provide information on what the correct setting is, so I cannot fully rewrite the answer without additional information from the source material.

**Answer**: A kingdom is described, in which the King "does not just sit around" but instead goes off and does the tasks himself and comes back to the Kingdom without giving orders. However, the story's narrator only sees the King in his castle (or building it), but it's assumed the King is from another Kingdom, since the story's narrator is native to the kingdom he currently is in.

**Critique**: The highlighted sentence is a run-on sentence.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the sentence structure, labeling it as a run-on sentence.

The narrator finally goes to him to ask about why he does all things he does and how he is different from others. The king relates his story to the narrator, how once he was like the narrator, how his kingdom was destroyed. This made the narrator believe everything he has told him.

**Critique**: The highlighted sentence is grammatically and syntactically incorrect.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that a specific sentence is grammatically and syntactically incorrect, but it does not specify which sentence is highlighted or provide guidance on how to correct it.

What does the passage say about the relationship between the narrator and the king?

**Answer**: The narrator is curious about what the king does. She knows that the king doesn't interact with other people very often because she hasn't seen him give anyone orders or instructions. One day, her curiosity leads her to sneak into the king's castle, and after having walked around for a while and have seen many interesting things, she musters up the courage to ask the king what he's doing. The king says it's his job to take care of the kingdom, and it comes to a point where he has to go and adventure with her. He says that a king has to take care of his people until the end of their time. After sharing childhood memories, he shares his own story about being a king, discovering where he was and how he found a village to call home. He tells her how important their first day is because that is their first day within their new kingdom. They still have a lot of adventuring to do together.

**Critique**: The narrator's gender is not stated. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the narrator's gender is not specified, which implies that the use of "she" in the answer should be changed to a gender-neutral pronoun like "they."

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the passage say about the relationship between the narrator and the king?

**Answer**: In childhood, the king looked like an ordinary villager, but was very active and usually took off for parts unknown. It became very clear to the narrator that the king was very different from all the adults because of his behavior and questions that would be raised by it. The narrator wanted to ask the king why he seemed so different and that was when the king told him a story involving himself and a different kingdom, saying that they weren’t real people. He went on to say that when a king dies, all that they ever did vanishes with them, so they left the kingdom they used to live in and made another village and had people of their own since the king of the old kingdom was killed right outside the gate. After coming to this conclusion, the narrator affirmed the friendship and relationship that he had with the king by going with him on adventures.

**Critique**: The highlighted sentence is unnecessary and does not answer the question. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that a specific sentence is unnecessary and does not answer the question. However, it does not specify which sentence is highlighted, making it impossible to determine which part of the answer should be removed. Without knowing which sentence is being referred to, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Critique**: The passage says nothing about being a parent; the narrator's parents are briefly mentioned with no further emphasis on their role as parents.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the passage does not discuss the role of being a parent, contrary to what the answer suggests. It implies that the current answer is incorrect because it misrepresents the content of the passage.

**Answer**: Nkala was elected chairman of the Bulawayo branch of the African Artisans' Union in 1950. He was elected president of the union in 1956. He served as president of the African Trade Union Congress' Matabeleland region. He was also appointed Chairman of the Barbourfields Tenants' Association and member of the Bulawayo African Townships Advisory Board. In 1957, Nkala joined the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress. He was a prominent figure in the African nationalist movement in Bulawayo. He was briefly detained after a state of emergency was declared by the colonial government in February 1959. He served as treasurer for the Bulawayo branch of the National Democratic Party (NDP) from 1960 to 1961. He was the Bulawayo district chairman for the NDP's successor, the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) from 1961 to 1963.

**Critique**: The question specifically asks for a summary of what happened before 1960

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer includes information beyond the specified time frame of "before 1960." This implies that the answer should be revised to exclude any events or roles that occurred in 1960 or later. Using the critique, I can improve the answer by removing the parts about Nkala's activities from 1960 onwards, specifically his roles in the National Democratic Party and the Zimbabwe African People's Union.

He went on to study at Mzingwane High School in Essexvale. He left behind a widow and five children.

**Critique**: Omits any mention of his brother

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is missing information about Nkala's brother. However, it does not provide any specific details about the brother, such as his name, role, or significance.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Answer**: The FBI claims Lesin was so drunk that he repeatedly and violently fell on things until he killed himself. He had blunt force trauma injuries all over his body.

**Critique**: Add that this is an unlikely circumstance (thereby answering the question directly)

**Rationale**: The critique suggests adding that the circumstances of Mikhail Lesin's death are unlikely, which directly addresses the question of why it is hard for critics to accept the suicide explanation. This implies that the improbability of the scenario contributes to the skepticism. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to improve the answer by explicitly stating the unlikelihood of the situation, which is the reason for the critics' doubt.

What does the story say about the narrator?

**Answer**: The narrator can be described as a keen and careful sergeant in the army with a caring family, who sacrifices his wellbeing as well as that of his men for the greater good. He is valiant and resourceful, and he is committed to his men for the time being, commanding their lives in the shells of their rifles. He is conflicted by the fact that he unwillingly leads the men, who stand shoulder by shoulder to the slaughter with camaraderie, pride, fear, and anger. He also admires his foe, the Germans, for their bravery and tenacity. The narrator is also confident that he will not die with the Germans because he is a lucky man. His spirit dwindles as the Germans begin unleashing massive weaponry and his fellows are being killed left and right. In the end, he falls into the water, where he is saved by the British soldiers.

**Critique**: The listing of these emotions does not make sense given context

**Rationale**: The critique states that "the listing of these emotions does not make sense given context," but it does not specify which emotions are incorrect or what the correct emotions should be.

He made it out to the lagoon but fell into the water and lost consciousness. The sergeant was rescued by a British company steamrolling through the coastline picking up survivors and POWs.  

**Critique**: He is also loyal to his men

**Rationale**: The critique provides additional information about the narrator's character, specifically mentioning his loyalty to his men.

### Sample 1155/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How does the story reflect its theme?

**Answer**: The theme is historical fiction (HF) and the story reflects it by depicting what is going through the mind of an officer and soldier in the army before a siege against an enemy with a superior strategic advantage. It is safe to assume that the story is set in World War II because of the steel water transport (Kraken) the narrator was in, who the enemy is (Germany), and the type of weapons used (mortars). The beachhead fighting scene is reminiscent of the Allied Normandy landings during the Battle of Normandy during WWII (external information). 

**Critique**: It could be set in World War I

The text mentions concerns over a particular dive by Dele Alli for which he received a booking that had caused some waves. Pochettino may be accused by some of giving divers a free pass.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what the text says about diving/dives. 

**Answer**: Diving has become a common complaint in football, with the tendency towards overanalysis resulting in the general fixation over minutiae. The issue is that this type of behaviour, while against the rules of the game, is seen by some as simply another sporting tactic. Meanwhile, Mauricio Pochettino is concerned that this focus on minor offences and shrewd maneuvering could change the nature of the game. Finally, Pochettino argues that referees should be free to make mistakes without being under excessive scrutiny.

**Critique**: Diving is a punishable offence, and not only a complaint, in football. Dele Alli has been penalized three times for simulation offences in as many seasons and has developed a bad reputation because of it. Include this in the response.

### Sample 1165/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what the text says about diving/dives. 

**Answer**: When people fall on a sport field, they are supposed to let go, and it is known as a dive. However, when people hide the fact that they are going to fall and pretend that they are hit on purpose are considered to be diving, and this is considered a foul or reason to be punished. Some people would do this as they try to win penalties from the referee or ability to suspend a game without a maximum timeframe. Shooting and tricking judges are frowned upon and is considered to be a foul. Experienced sports heads said that was the way to go and that it was athletic. Older players would be critical if their younger counterparts weren't able to dive. Diving should be saved for when an agreement has been established that it is the type of sport where players are expected to trick and fake out their opponents. However, since it hasn't been established yet, diving and gamesmanship are on equal turf. Tribalism and winning at all costs is correlated with the amount of people who will "dive" and walk away without merit.

**Critique**: Diving happens in football to win a penalty from the referee, it is a skill that players used to practice. Nowadays it is punishable as a simulation foul and the player can be carded for it. Change the description of diving in the first two sentences of the response to better reflect the article.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about how diving is perceived and penalized in football, which allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It suggests that the description of diving in the first two sentences should be changed to reflect that diving is used to win penalties and is now punishable as a simulation foul. This gives clear guidance on how to adjust the initial sentences to align with the critique's information, without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what the text says about referees. 

**Answer**: The text wants both sides afield to have personalities. A referee should be a person and not just a live recording device. Video technology should not replace a human touch. If you both make a mistake nothing should happen, everyone is human. Human referees are better than computer-generated referees because they are an intrinsic part of the game.

**Answer**: The text argues that while the referee was correct in issuing a yellow card to Dele Alli for simulation, there is too much focus on minutiae in general, which worries the Tottenham manager. This worry is based on the possibility of changing the game in a way which is undesirable.

The union bound themselves closer to the Czechoslovak Socialist Party as it faced police repression. As many miners were arrested and the union was increasingly dependent on the Czechoslovak Socialist Party.

**Critique**: It is omitted that its members struggled with economic hardship.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is missing information about the economic hardship faced by the members of SČH. However, it does not provide specific details or examples of this economic hardship, which means that I cannot concretely improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the nature or specifics of the economic hardship.

What does the text say about John Kennedy's early radio career?

**Answer**: Kennedy was given the chance to begin broadcasting a music show from Radio Thamesmead, and worked as a disc jockey while attending the University of Norwich.

Additionally, Kennedy is often a member of the judging panel for the Mercury Prize.

**Critique**: Answer covers his whole career as opposed to just his 'early' career.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer should focus specifically on John Kennedy's early radio career rather than his entire career. This implies that the information about his later career, such as hosting X-Posure on Radio X and being a judge for the Mercury Prize, should be removed.

Summarize everything relating to the mine's name.

**Answer**: The Chungar M ine is an inactive mine that exploited a polymetallic skarn deposit. It is located near Cerro de Pasco, Peru and was destroyed by a landslide-generated wave in 1971. After this disaster, the mining company moved the operations to the Animón mines 16 km NE of the original Chungar Mine. The name "Chungar Mine" has caused some confusion, as the mining company Volcan now uses the name "Mining Unit Chungar" to refer to the Animón mine.

**Critique**: Fix "Mine"

**Rationale**: The critique "Fix 'Mine'" implies that there is a spelling or capitalization error with the word "Mine" in the answer. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by correcting the capitalization of "M ine" to "Mine" in the first sentence. This is a specific and actionable change that can be made directly from the critique.

### Sample 1206/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe the ways in which the woman fights off her assailant.

**Answer**: The woman doesn't initially think that anything could happen while she's alone in the house with only the baby. However, after hearing the cough coming from the basement, the woman starts to feel paranoid. When the man tells her of his friend who is staying in the home, she is skeptical but decides to let him stay. After she falls asleep, the two men in all black approach and overpower her. In spite of her attempts to fight back, she is subdued and taken to the camaro with the bald-headed driver. The woman then struggles fiercely to keep her baby safe and alive throughout the entirety of the car ride. She uses a piece of a broken vase in order to stab one of the men in the eye; she eventually succeeds in getting the baby out of the car following a jump from a balcony. She is able to fight back and protect her baby in order to avoid coming to harm.

**Critique**: There is no evidence to suggest the woman keeps the baby safe throughout the car ride or that she gets the baby out of the car.

**Rationale**: The critique points out specific inaccuracies in the answer regarding the woman's actions to keep the baby safe during the car ride and getting the baby out of the car. However, it does not provide any information on what actually happens in those situations.

She is then able to escape from the house and its occupants to save herself and her baby. The altercation on the ground makes the woman realize she has to fight her way out in order to save herself and her baby. She must be proactive and use any means necessary in order to escape her attackers. Although it seems like an uphill battle, she does not give up. She uses her strength and ingenuity to subdue the assailants. She uses whatever is at her disposal to create a way to get out of the situation alive.

**Critique**: The response implies that the baby belongs to the narrator, which is inaccurate.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the implication of the baby belonging to the narrator is inaccurate. This suggests that the part of the answer referring to "her baby" should be corrected to avoid this implication. Without needing to refer back to the source material, the editor can revise the answer to remove or alter the reference to the baby being the narrator's, ensuring the description of the woman's actions remains accurate.

What does the text say about Qonqurtai?

**Answer**: Qonqurtai was a Mongol prince and viceroy of Anatolia for the Ilkhanate khanate. He was born to Hulagu Khan and Ajuja Aguchi, his Khitan concubine wife. He was the senior commander during the reign of his brother Abaqa. He was twice appointed as viceroy of Anatolia. He was appointed as commander of Ilkhanid army in Anatolia with Shams al-Din Juvayni as his vizier. He was executed on 17 January 1284.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Qonqurtai's early life? 

**Answer**: Qonqurtai was born to Hulagu Khan and Ajuja Aguchi, his Khitan concubine wife. He was the senior commander during the reign of his brother Abaqa. He was twice appointed as viceroy of Anatolia.

**Critique**: If he was a commander, it probably doesn't count as "early life"

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the information about Qonqurtai being a commander is not relevant to his "early life," which is the focus of the question. This implies that the part about him being a commander should be removed to better align the answer with the question. However, the critique does not provide any additional information about Qonqurtai's early life, nor does it suggest what should be included instead. Therefore, while it suggests removing irrelevant information, it does not provide enough information to improve the answer regarding Qonqurtai's early life without consulting the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Qonqurtai's family? 

**Answer**: Qonqurtai came from an eventful family. His mother was his father's Khitan concubine wife. Qonqurtai had nine brothers, among whom he was the senior commander. Two of his brothers competed for the Ilkhan's throne - Abaqa and Tekuder. He was married to Toqiyatai Khatun, a Keraite concubine of Hulagu and niece of Dokuz Khatun. His marriage gave Hulagu influence over Toqiyatai's family. Qonqurtai and Toqiyatai had nine children, four of whom died in infancy. After him and his two surviving children were killed, two of his nephews were in line for the throne - Arghun and Ghazan, who were grandsons of Abaqa.

**Critique**: He had at least 8 brothers

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It states that Qonqurtai had "at least 8 brothers," which implies that the current statement "Qonqurtai had nine brothers" might be incorrect or needs clarification. Without needing to refer back to the source material, the answer can be adjusted to reflect this information by stating, "Qonqurtai had at least 8 brothers," which aligns with the critique.

**Answer**: Qonqurtai was born to Hulagu Khan and Ajuja Aguchi, his Khitan concubine wife. Qonqurtai was Hulagu's ninth son, and also the senior commander during his brother Abaqa's reign as emperor. 

He was married to Toqiyatai Khatun, a Keraite concubine of Hulagu and niece of Dokuz Khatun. She was described as the wise ruler in Zafarnamah.


**Critique**: His wife was not the one described by Zafarnamah

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the description of Qonqurtai's wife as "the wise ruler in Zafarnamah" is incorrect.

**Critique**: There's no evidence in the passage that suggest that the Zooligans were a non-profit organization.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that there is no evidence in the passage to support the claim that the Zooligans were a non-profit organization. This implies that the statement about the Zooligans being a non-profit should be removed or revised.

Nehringowa's speed skating career lasted 17 years, during which she always skated at a high level. Nehringowa was Polish champion twelve times and was famous for her racing style. Nehringowa was the first woman to set world records sanctioned by the International Skating Union. All the four of Nehringowa's world records in speed skating were set in 1934.

**Critique**: In 1931, Nehringowa set the world records in the 500m, 1000m, 1500m, 3000m and 5000m. These results were approved by the ISU's the first women's speed skating world records.

### Sample 1232/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Zofia Nehringowa's sport results?

**Answer**: Nehringowa first participated in the Warsaw Ice Skating Society when she was 15 years old. From there she went on to training under Edward Nehring. After Nehring divorced Nehringowa, he married her in his second attempt years later. He had two children with Nehringowa (two sons)  but the two were presumably granted a divorce when Edward turned 35 years old, as he remarried a woman who was 39 years old. Nehringowa, meanwhile, only had two children of her lifespan before she died. In the 1980s and early 90s, ISU accepted women into their competitions, and Nehringowa was "the first woman speed skater in Poland". Nehringowa was a part of the 1932 European Speed Skating Championships for Men, the first women's championship, and the 500m record she set at the time stood for 40 years before it was beaten again by any skater. Nehringowa was also the first person to become a record-breaker recognized by the ISU, but there is a dispute as to whether she set the 5000m record for the international speed skating union.

**Critique**: Remove the information in the response regarding Edward Nehring, as well as the information from the 1980's and 1990's. It does not have any bearing on the question.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific instructions on what to remove from the answer, indicating that the information about Edward Nehring and the details from the 1980s and 1990s are irrelevant to the question about Zofia Nehringowa's sport results. By following these instructions, the answer can be improved to focus solely on her achievements in speed skating, such as her participation in the 1932 European Speed Skating Championships for Men, her record-setting 500m performance, and her recognition by the ISU. This allows for a more concise and relevant response to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific details about Zofia Nehringowa's sport results, including the exact years and distances for which she set or broke world records. It corrects and expands upon the original answer by specifying the distances and years of her achievements. With this information, I can improve the answer by updating the distances and years mentioned, as well as including the additional records set in 1931 and 1935. Therefore, I can write a better answer using only the current answer and the critique.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is the message that the writer wanted to convey in this satirical work?

**Answer**: The message of this piece is that charity should not be forced on people and that people should be able to choose for themselves what causes to support. The fact that everyone becomes violent and irrational when forced into a charity discussion is used to highlight the censorship of self-determination. This piece is meant to encourage greater freedom and discussion around choosing one's own charity.

**Critique**: While charity was mentioned in the story, no specific causes were mentioned and it was just a small part in the larger story.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the focus on charity in the answer is disproportionate to its role in the story, suggesting that the message of the work might be broader or different. However, the critique does not provide enough information about what the main message of the satirical work actually is. Without knowing what the larger story is about or what the main themes are, it's impossible to improve the answer to accurately reflect the writer's intended message.

In what way has the term "aquapelago" expanded from scientific to cultural?

**Answer**: "Shima" is now a convened conference on island and maritime cultures. There has been a resurgence of mermaid mythology in pop culture that has been called into question. One essay called the variation of folklore dealing with misunderstood sea-creatures "mermaidlore". The mermaid theme is fairly broad and not directly scientific, but it does seem to be linked to cultures revolving around water areas. It seems bringing together themes of aquapelogistics, historic myths about mermaids, and cultural practices about that around sea territories is a cultural expansion.

What does the article say about Jeroen Bosaert?

**Answer**: Bosaert is a reporter for the Belgian newspaper HLN. He investigated the threats to Turkish journalists in Belgium and found that the Turkish Embassy was involved. Bosaert asked the Embassy for information but received a statement that no person with the name Selim Güzel worked there or was involved in the threats. However, further investigation revealed that Selim Güzel had previously worked as a consultant for the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and some of his tweets matched the timeline of the threats against Turkish journalists in Belgium. Bosaert has also reported that he was taken into police protection for six months following his complaint.

**Critique**: There is no evidence in the text to suggest that Güzel had worked as a consultant for the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The text only mentions him as working for the Turkish Embassy.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a specific inaccuracy in the answer regarding Selim Güzel's employment history. It states that there is no evidence in the text to support the claim that Güzel worked as a consultant for the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and that the text only mentions him as working for the Turkish Embassy. This provides clear guidance on how to correct the answer: remove or correct the part about Güzel's employment with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The news article cites Bosaert as the source of this information, and his coverage of the story has been detailed and thorough.

**Critique**: The response incorrectly mentions that Bosaert was the one who detected the IP addresses associated with the threats, however it was the Belgian police. Bosaert was actually the one who called the Embassy to ask about Güzel, one of the threat-makers. The embassy denied knowing him but Bosaert continued digging, uncovering inconsistencies and revealing that Güzel was in fact working for the embassy. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what Jeroen Bosaert actually did, correcting the inaccuracies in the original answer. It states that Bosaert was not the one who detected the IP addresses; instead, he called the Embassy to inquire about Güzel and uncovered inconsistencies.

R. has reported the contradiction in the Turkish Embassy's statements, and has stated that he is a journalist following the situation of Belgium and Turkey's EU relations. The police have also taken security precautions around R. since his complaint. The prosecutor's office might have been incapacitated as the suspects have diplomatic immunity, and they will likely wait and see how far the investigation into the matter can go.

**Critique**: The response inaccurately mentions that R. reported the contradictions in the Turkish Embassy's statements, it was actually Bosaert that reported it.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about an inaccuracy in the answer. It states that it was Bosaert, not R., who reported the contradictions in the Turkish Embassy's statements.

Summarize what the article has to say about voter fraud. 

**Answer**: The article discusses the disbandment of President Trump's election integrity commission. It indicates that voter fraud is a widespread concern in the American population, with more people concerned than not. Although an overwhelming majority of Americans consider voter fraud to be widespread, some leftists insist that voter fraud is not a problem, and argue that efforts to examine the issue are "disenfranchisement." As such, despite the disbandment of the Commission, the Department of Homeland Security is likely to step in and pursue investigations of voter fraud.

They are certain their more relaxed policies on registration and procedures does not affect the outcome of elections. Democrats do not want to risk demonizing and alienating voters by cracking down on policies with stricter voter regulations. 

**Critique**: The first and last sentences are inaccurate and half made-up. The answer should instead talk about how the Democrats think the investigation on election fraud is to suppress voters, etc.

The Democrats state that there is no need for an investigation of the extent of voter fraud because there is no evidence and such investigations are discriminating Americans who are trying to vote. They also state that there is a danger of disenfranchisement if DHS and other government come to check fraudulent voting.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize why Democrats think their policies on voting procedures are right, according to the author.

**Answer**: Democrat politicians and organizations contend their policies on voting procedures are right because they favor more access to the ballot and protections for voters, as compared to ensuring the integrity of the voting process by investigating possible cases of voter fraud. In contrast, Republicans advocate investigating possible cases of voter fraud in order to deter fraud and protect the integrity of elections. The disbanding of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, due to resistance from Democrats and leftist organizations, in no way indicates the need for the DHS to slack on investigating voter fraud.

**Critique**: "The disbanding of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, due to resistance from Democrats and leftist organizations, in no way indicates the need for the DHS to slack on investigating voter fraud." This sentence is irrelevant and should be removed.

**Rationale**: The critique specifically identifies a sentence in the answer as irrelevant and suggests its removal.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize why Democrats think their policies on voting procedures are right, according to the author.

**Answer**: According to the author, Democrats believe their policies on voting procedures are right because they are concerned primarily with preventing voter suppression, not fraud. Thus, any attempt by Homeland Security to investigate voter fraud, even though such fraud has been documented, would be seen as disenfranchisement by Democrats. Furthermore, Democrats want a Special Counsel to probe Trump's alleged collusion with Russia - despite no evidence to support those claims - and see that investigation as a justification for DHS not to investigate voter fraud.

**Critique**: The Democrats don't see the investigation about Russia as a justification for DHS to not investigate voter fraud. That part is made up. However, the answer can mention that the author thinks the Democrats are being selective in their desire to investigate elections.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clearly states that the part about Democrats seeing the Russia investigation as a justification for DHS not to investigate voter fraud is incorrect and should be removed. Additionally, it suggests including the author's view that Democrats are being selective in their desire to investigate elections.

### Sample 1280/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the feelings the characters in the text have about the food served to them.

**Answer**: Adams wife is fed up of the food, and Adams son complains about the food. Adam's lungs stopped rejecting inhaling the air and his appetite was along way from healthy. Parts of the story suggest that the food is from the government which is how everyone gets food. People are unhappy about the food, it is not appetizing.

**Critique**: Some of the words are lacking appropriate punctuation - "Adams son" instead of Adam's son. Also, I would substitute "and" for "but" in the second sentence.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by correcting punctuation and suggesting a word substitution. The critique points out the missing apostrophe in "Adams son," which can be corrected to "Adam's son," and suggests changing "and" to "but" in the second sentence to improve clarity. These changes can be made without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1281/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the feelings the characters in the text have about the food served to them.

**Answer**: The characters feel frustration and anger about the food they receive, though they understand that they should be grateful to receive sustenance at all.

**Critique**: The gratitude sentiment is not shared by every character in the story.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the statement about gratitude is not universally applicable to all characters. This implies that the answer should be adjusted to reflect that not all characters share the sentiment of gratitude. Without needing to refer back to the source material, the answer can be improved by modifying the statement to specify that only some characters feel grateful, while others do not. For example, the revised answer could state: "The characters feel frustration and anger about the food they receive, and while some understand that they should be grateful to receive sustenance, this sentiment is not shared by all."

### Sample 1282/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the emotions of the people once they heard the message the MOXERS gave out. 

**Answer**: Adam and some people around him look horrified when they heard the message the MOXERS were giving out. Most people present slowly started to dissipate, while a group of people chanted, "This is the hate of the old age!" The people's fear is palpable when they were shifting in the place watching the MOXERS. The government is the one to calm down the people, telling the people that they should go home or they will be shot. Adam and the other peoples' fear is palpable as they are running away.

**Critique**: It is not clear that the government was calming people down as there were masked men from both sides shooting at each other.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts the current answer, specifically regarding the role of the government. It implies that the government was not calming people down, as there were masked men from both sides shooting at each other. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing or correcting the part about the government calming people down and instead mentioning the presence of masked men and the shooting. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it provides enough information to improve the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

Summarize the emotions of the people once they heard the message the MOXERS gave out. 

**Answer**: The people were initially curious but then quickly felt fear as they watched the MOXERS wreak havoc in the town center. The feeling turned to anger as the gunshots and screams made their way through the crowd. In the end, many people were left with overwhelming grief at the loss of loved ones.

**Critique**: It is not clear from the story that the masked gunmen were MOXERS.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that it is not clear from the story that the masked gunmen were MOXERS. However, it does not provide any information on what the correct identification of the gunmen should be or how to adjust the answer to accurately reflect the story. Without knowing who the gunmen actually are, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique identifies a potential inaccuracy but does not provide enough information to correct it without referring back to the source material.

### Sample 1284/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the emotions of the people once they heard the message the MOXERS gave out. 

**Answer**: Everyone was in a frenzy and in the disorder that ensued people were screaming and running about. The two lenses in the form of "power" and "order" were slowly following the victims. The death toll was very high, there were bodies lying all over, some dying out and others already dead.

**Critique**: - I could not find lenses with written words like "power" and "order" slowly following the characters in the story.



**Rationale**: The critique points out that the specific detail about "lenses with written words like 'power' and 'order' slowly following the characters" cannot be found in the source material. However, it does not provide any information on what should replace this detail or how to correct it. Without knowing what the correct detail is, I cannot improve the answer. The critique does not imply an alternative or correct information that can be used to revise the answer.

### Sample 1285/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the emotions of the people once they heard the message the MOXERS gave out. 

**Answer**: When the MOXERS gave out a message of revolution its effects were an increase in embodied fear and a feeling of powerlessness in the face of violence. The people were horrified by the violence, feeling both fear and deep sadness for those that lost their lives.

**Critique**: The feeling of fear and powerlessness felt by the people were not just from the MoXERS' message.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the feelings of fear and powerlessness were not solely due to the MOXERS' message, but it does not provide information on what else contributed to these emotions. Without additional details on the other factors that caused these feelings, I cannot improve the answer. The critique points out an issue but does not provide enough information to correct or enhance the answer without referring back to the source material.

If the MOXERS had not come to free the prisoners, how would Adam and his family's life look?

**Answer**: They would have died that day.

**Critique**: They would not die.

**Rationale**: The critique states that "They would not die," which directly contradicts the current answer. However, it does not provide any information or implications about what would actually happen to Adam and his family if the MOXERS had not come. Without additional details or suggestions on what the correct outcome would be, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the alternative scenario.

### Sample 1287/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

If the MOXERS had not come to free the prisoners, how would Adam and his family's life look?

**Answer**: From how Adam is thankful for receiving a hot meal, he would have made him and his family stay in the same situation as they were in, as prisoners. Adam seemed to be a man of habit, as he urged his family to move so they wouldn't miss the news. Adam would also hope to provide his son with the most sense of security that he could. Adam's first reaction to when the MOXERS came was to get his family away from the sea of people before the gunshots started.  

**Critique**: Much of the response is irrelevant to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique states that much of the response is irrelevant to the question, but it does not specify which parts are irrelevant or what relevant information should be included. Without knowing which parts are considered irrelevant or what specific information should be added, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material. The critique does not provide enough guidance to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

If the MOXERS had not come to free the prisoners, how would Adam and his family's life look?

**Answer**: He probably would have died after food poisoning of some kind.

**Critique**: While that is likely, it does not seem (from the story) like the government wants to poison its citizens.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the assumption about food poisoning may not align with the story's portrayal of the government's intentions. However, it does not provide an alternative scenario or specific information about what would have happened to Adam and his family. Without additional details or implications about what the government might do instead, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the government's actual intentions or actions in the story.

**Critique**: The second and third sentences should be combined for better flow.

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific suggestion to improve the answer by combining the second and third sentences for better flow.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What exactly made the FBI convinced of foreign interference in the United States' 2016 election?

**Answer**: Information the FBI obtained about former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos spurred the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into whether campaign officials had improper contacts with Russia. The FBI used the Steele dossier, in part, to obtain surveillance warrants for Trump ally Carter Page.

**Critique**: It is not quite relevant that the FBI used the Steele dossier. I would delete the last sentence.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the last sentence about the Steele dossier is not relevant and suggests deleting it. This provides a clear and actionable step to improve the answer by removing the irrelevant information. Therefore, I can make a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: George Papadopoulos' comments in an Australian diplomat that the Russians had damaging information on Hillary Clinton is what made the FBI begin investigating possible improper contact between Trump campaign officials and Russia. This inquiry was not based on the Steele dossier, unlike previous claims.

**Critique**: It is omitted that the Australian government tipped off the FBI to what Papadopoulos had said.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the answer to improve it. It states that the Australian government tipped off the FBI about Papadopoulos' comments, which is a concrete detail that can be included without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: It opened an investigation based on Papadopoulos' claim, which evidently lead to the firing of being a major figure in Hillary Clinton's official campaign.

**Critique**: 'which evidently lead to the firing of being a major figure in Hillary Clinton's official campaign.' makes no sense. Papadopoulos was one of the major figures in Trump's campaign.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that Papadopoulos was a major figure in Trump's campaign, not Hillary Clinton's. This correction can be directly applied to improve the accuracy of the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: No, the outlet was coordinated by the Steele Dossier.

**Critique**: It is irrelevant that the outlet was coordinated by the Steele Dossier.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the mention of the Steele Dossier is irrelevant to the question of whether the FBI was planning to investigate any Russian threat to the election prior to obtaining information from the Australian government. This implies that the part about the Steele Dossier should be removed from the answer. However, the critique does not provide any information or implication about what the correct answer should be regarding the FBI's plans. Therefore, without additional information from the source, I cannot improve the answer to address the question accurately.

### Sample 1297/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What there any personal vendetta involved in the investigation of the Trump campaign and its links with Russia?

**Answer**: Former FBI agent Peter Strzok was a central figure to the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email arrangement, and he lead the investigation into Trump campaign officials. His text messages (together with his mistress) were disparaging of Trump before and during the investigation. Despite personal biases, it would seem it was the right decision to place Strzok on the investigation team.

**Critique**: It is irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is irrelevant, but it does not specify which part of the answer is irrelevant or provide any guidance on what would be relevant. Without knowing which specific information is irrelevant or what relevant information should be included, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Answer**: The FBI secretly investigated the Trump campaign with a team made up of Trump critics. He team concluded that there was Russian interference in the elections and found evidence that the campaign collaborated with Russian operatives. The dossier on which the investigation was based was paid for in part by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.

**Critique**: It is irrelevant

**Rationale**: The critique states that "It is irrelevant," but it does not specify which part of the answer is irrelevant. Without knowing which specific information is deemed irrelevant, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer.

### Sample 1299/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What there any personal vendetta involved in the investigation of the Trump campaign and its links with Russia?

**Answer**: There is evidence of personal vendetta involved in the investigation into Trump's campaign and its links with Russia; namely against Trump advisor George Papadopoulos. FBI agent Peter Strzok reportedly began the investigation of the Trump campaign based on information he obtained about Papadopoulos, rather than the Steele dossier, which Trump supporters have claimed was politically motivated.

**Critique**: It is irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the information provided in the answer is irrelevant. However, it does not specify which part of the answer is irrelevant or what relevant information should be included instead. Without additional details or guidance on what constitutes relevant information, it is not possible to improve the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

### Sample 1300/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What there any personal vendetta involved in the investigation of the Trump campaign and its links with Russia?

**Answer**: There does not appear to be any personal vendetta involved in the investigation into the Trump campaign and its links with Russia. The investigation was launched based on information about George Papadopoulos, not the Steele dossier. The dossier was used in obtaining a warrant for Carter Page, but the memo asserts there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page and Papadopoulos.

**Critique**: It is incorrect that there is no personal vendetta involved in the investigation into the Trump campaign and its links with Russia.

**Rationale**: The critique states that it is incorrect to say there is no personal vendetta involved in the investigation, but it does not provide any specific information or details about what the personal vendetta might be. Without additional information or context, it is not possible to improve the answer to accurately reflect the presence of a personal vendetta.

What does the story say about Sabrina's relationship with the man that enters her hotel room?

**Answer**: Sabrina has a drug addiction. She's been buying drugs from the man that enters her room, and he has been selling them to her. She has stolen his drugs and money and he is trying to get it back. He comes to her room looking for the person who stole his drugs.

**Critique**: He thinks that she stole his drugs and money, because she is the last person he sold to in days. But she has no idea what he is talking about and suspects that he is high. Remove the third sentence, it is a duplication of the final sentence. Include money in the final sentence as well.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer. It clarifies that Sabrina does not actually know about the theft, which corrects the narrative in the original answer. The critique also suggests removing the third sentence because it duplicates information in the final sentence, and it advises including "money" in the final sentence. These instructions allow for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific details about the interaction between Sabrina and the drug dealer, such as the violent actions (kicking in the door, poking her in the eye with a hot rod) and the derogatory language used. These details allow for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the tone to reflect the violent nature of their relationship.

**Critique**: Remove the references to Sabrina's self-harming behavior and the razor blade used to accomplish this. It does not have bearing on the question.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on what to remove from the answer, indicating that the references to Sabrina's self-harming behavior and the razor blade are irrelevant to the question about her relationship with the man. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by focusing solely on the relationship aspect without needing to refer back to the source material. The editor can remove the parts about self-harm and the razor blade, thus making the answer more relevant to the question.

Some of the confirmed judges have been criticized for not agreeing with Brown v. Board of Education, a 1954 Supreme Court decision which ruled segregation of public schools unconstitutional.

**Critique**: The answer omits the major outcry about Democrat senators failing to oppose the confirmation of the judges.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a specific omission in the answer regarding the reaction of Democrat senators to the confirmation of the judges.

### Sample 1309/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the main news event.

**Answer**: The Republican-controlled Senate confirmed 13 of President Donald Trump's lifetime judicial nominees this week. The confirmations were done at breakneck speed in the last weeks before the Senate breaks following a voice vote with little opposition from Democrats. In mainstream media the news has been overshadowed by the 2020 Democratic presidential debates. Two of the candidates that have been confirmed would not say they agreed with the bedrock civil rights decision Brown v. Board of Education. The Republicans hope that the new judges will help to dismantle reproductive rights, marriage equality and shred the New Deal.

**Critique**: Dismantling reproductive rights, marriage equality, and shredding the New Deal is what the Progressives fear the Republicans will do. The Republicans made no statement corroborating the framing favored by the Progressives.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the statement about dismantling reproductive rights, marriage equality, and shredding the New Deal reflects the fears of Progressives, not the stated intentions of the Republicans. Therefore, the answer can be improved by rephrasing that part to accurately represent the critique's clarification. For example, the revised answer could state: "Progressives fear that the new judges may help to dismantle reproductive rights, marriage equality, and shred the New Deal, although the Republicans have not made any statements corroborating this framing."

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the views of the opposing sides.

**Answer**: Republicans are counting on these judges to dismantle reproductive rights, marriage equality, and the separation of church and state and to use the courts to shred the New Deal and regulations that protect the people from corporate power. They believe the Democrats are letting Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump do this to consolidate their power and are counting on the voters to stop them. The Democratic Party, in some cases, appears to be acquiescing.

**Critique**: The Republicans are stated to believe Democrats are letting McConnell and Trump do their thing to consolidate their power, which is made up.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about Republicans believing Democrats are letting McConnell and Trump consolidate power is incorrect. However, it does not provide any information on what the Republicans actually believe or what the correct view is.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the views of the opposing sides.

**Answer**: The Republican-controlled Senate has been confirming Trump's judicial picks at breakneck speed, which progressives say is part of the ongoing effort to drag the nation's courts further to the right for decades to come. The speed with which these judicial picks are being pushed through the Senate has largely gone under the radar, overshadowing coverage of the 2020 Democratic presidential debates.

Progressives say that these judicial picks include "alarming, narrow-minded elitists" who are hostile to civil rights and would dismantle reproductive rights, marriage equality, and the separation of church and state. Republicans, on the other hand, are hoping these judges will carry out their radical agenda, and believe they need to get confirmed in order to have lasting impact.

**Critique**: The overview of the first paragraph is irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the overview of the first paragraph is irrelevant. This implies that the first paragraph should be removed or revised to focus more directly on summarizing the views of the opposing sides.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the views of the opposing sides.

**Answer**: With their control of the Senate, the Republicans hope to reshape the nation's court and drag them further toward the right for decades to come. The Democrats did not give major opposition to the confirmations. This irks progressive right groups like the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and People of the American Way. They feel that the new judges are hostile to progressive agendas, narrow-minded and elitist and both have an issue with two of the confirmations not confirming the bedrock civil rights decision in Brown v. Board of Education. The Washington Governor even feels that they were confirmed so the Democrats could go on vacation and for no other reason.

**Critique**: The overview given in the first three sentences is irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the first three sentences of the answer are irrelevant. This implies that these sentences should be removed to improve the answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the role of Kristine Lucius in the news.

**Answer**: Kristine Lucius is the executive vice president for policy and government affairs at the Leadership Conference. According to the passage, she criticized Senate Republicans for getting through young, unqualified conservative judges too quickly.

Describe what was Devi's inspiration to build toilets. 

**Answer**: Kalavati Devi was motivated by disgust at seeing people defecating in the streets and an unquenchable need to improve the lot particularly for women and children. She became a mason with assistance from Shramik Bharti, and succeeded in persuading WaterAid to help fund toilets in a slum community where people had resisted change. She won the highest award for women in India for her work. Devi's motivation was to help improve the lives of those around her.

**Critique**: It is irrelevant that she became a mason with assistance from Shramik Bharti, and succeeded in persuading WaterAid to help fund toilets in a slum community where people had resisted change; she won the highest award for women in India for her work; Devi's motivation was to help improve the lives of those around her.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies specific parts of the answer as irrelevant, which implies that these parts should be removed to improve the answer.

### Sample 1318/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe what was Devi's inspiration to build toilets. 

**Answer**: The inspiration for Devi to build toilets was a disgust and frustration with people defecating in the streets. She saw it as a living hell for the people living there and wanted to improve their conditions. She gathered funds and encouraged local companies to donate money for building toilets. She started building toilets herself, even learning how to be a mason to make this happen. Her inspiration was to provide dignity and sanitation for the people in her community.

**Critique**: It is irrelevant that she gathered funds and encouraged local companies to donate money for building toilets. She started building toilets herself, even learning how to be a mason to make this happen.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the information about Devi gathering funds and encouraging local companies to donate is irrelevant. It also confirms that the part about her learning to be a mason and building toilets herself is relevant. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the irrelevant information about gathering funds and donations, focusing instead on her personal actions and motivations.

**Answer**: In 2019, Kalavati Devi was awarded the Nari Shakti Puraskar, one of twelve given by the President of India to women who have made a positive difference in their communities. Devi is an Indian mason who built 50-seat toilets in Kanpur and helped to build 4,000 toilets improving conditions especially for women and children. Devi has done this despite facing challenges from local communities who were unwilling to cooperate due to fears that there must be a hidden agenda. Her outstanding work has been recognised at the national level with this important award.

**Critique**: It is irrelevant that Devi is an Indian mason who built 50-seat toilets in Kanpur and helped to build 4,000 toilets improving conditions especially for women and children; Devi has done this despite facing challenges from local communities who were unwilling to cooperate due to fears that there must be a hidden agenda.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that certain details about Kalavati Devi's work as a mason and the challenges she faced are irrelevant to the question about honors and awards. This implies that these details should be removed to focus solely on the honors and awards. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the irrelevant information and keeping the focus on the Nari Shakti Puraskar award she received.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe some of the difficulties Devi had to overcome to help her community and build toilets. 

**Answer**: When she first tried to help her area, she faced both gender discrimination and blackmail. Locals resisted giving funds, and simply denied she needed financial help because they said she had a ”secret agenda.” The shanty town of Rakhi Mandi also had a history of siting feces within the area, and Devi had to walk in the rain to find land on which to build the necessary toilets.

**Critique**: It is not stated that she faced both gender discrimination and blackmail.


**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statements about gender discrimination and blackmail are not supported. However, it does not provide any information on what difficulties Devi actually faced. Without knowing what is correct, I cannot improve the answer.

**Answer**: Devi faced countless difficulties in her efforts to improve cleanliness in her community. She faced skepticism from those who did not believe she had any kind of agenda or did not trust that water would be provided with the toilets she proposed. She also had to walk long distances in inclement weather to get to her building sites. Additionally, she has to deal with the death of her husband and son-in-law, who were crucial to her success. Through all these hardships she has now received the Nari Shakti Puraskar for her work in providing toilets and improving conditions for women and children in Kanpur.

**Critique**: It was not stated that she faced skepticism from those who did not believe she had any kind of agenda or did not trust that water would be provided with the toilets she proposed. It was stated that the local community thought there was a secret agenda.


**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It clarifies that the skepticism Devi faced was due to the local community thinking there was a secret agenda, rather than not believing she had any kind of agenda or not trusting that water would be provided. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the nature of the skepticism she faced.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about the narrator telling himself that crying is normal is not supported by the story. However, it does not provide any information on what the narrator actually does or thinks about his crying.

**Critique**: There is no indication that the narrator tells himself that crying is normal in the circumstances, nor that he wonders if he merits being told he has limited time left.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that two specific statements in the answer are not supported by the story: the narrator telling himself that crying is normal and wondering if he merits being told about his limited time.

What does the story say about mental illness?

**Answer**: The man seems to suffer from schizophrenia. He cannot stop staring at the floor, at the time where the story takes place, the carpet. He is found in an institution after a mental breakdown from not being in control of his own life. He isn't able to distinguish what is a hallucination and what isn't. He seems to get lost in it and feels a sense of panic. When he yells, he is mistaken thinking "I'm sorry Mr. Blocker. I don't understand."

**Critique**: The story does not say anything specific about mental illness and the answer's suggestion the main character suffers from schizophrenia is completely unfounded. At best, the main character appears to be a little obsessive in his attempts to identify the color of the carpet, but much of the answer is untrue.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the story does not specifically address mental illness and that the suggestion of schizophrenia is unfounded. It implies that the main character might be obsessive about identifying the carpet's color. However, it does not provide enough specific information to correct the answer fully. While it suggests removing the mention of schizophrenia, it does not offer a clear alternative explanation or description of the character's behavior that can be used to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Critique**: The first sentence is not stated.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the first sentence of the answer is not stated, which implies that the information about the U.S red flag list being a list of Chinese companies and research institutions with connections to the Chinese government is not accurate or confirmed.

Any attempt to enforce such a law as written would most likely be unconstitutional, resulting in its demise. The law is purely cynical and designed to game the emotions of the electorate.

**Critique**: "by defining it vaguely and omitting a definition altogether" is a contradiction

**Rationale**: The critique points out a contradiction in the answer, specifically the phrase "by defining it vaguely and omitting a definition altogether." This implies that the answer should be revised to either clarify how the law is defined vaguely or to state that there is no definition provided. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement by addressing the contradiction, either by removing the phrase or rephrasing it to eliminate the contradiction.

**Critique**: First sentence is very poorly phrased; the main event was the passing of a new law

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by indicating that the first sentence is poorly phrased and that the main event is the passing of a new law. This implies that the first sentence should be rephrased to clearly state that the main news event is the passing of the new law.

### Sample 1343/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about cyberbullying?

**Answer**: Bullying is a problem and causes harm, but defining what it is in a way that does not violate the First Amendment is nearly impossible. The writer defines it as enemies taunting one another and invalidating each other's opinions. The New York Senate did not attempt to define cyberbullying at all but wrote SB2318A in such a way that cyberbullying is defined as cyberbullying. It might have been their intention that a judge develop the definition because it is extremely difficult to write a law that criminalizes conduct that is harmful and wrong and that is also subject to constant variation based on unique circumstances. Any attempt to define cyberbullying will infringe on the First Amendment.

**Critique**: The author doesn't define cyberbullying

**Rationale**: The critique states that "The author doesn't define cyberbullying," which indicates that the current answer lacks a clear definition of cyberbullying. However, the critique does not provide any information or suggestions on how to define cyberbullying. Without additional information or guidance from the critique, it is not possible to improve the answer to include a definition of cyberbullying.

What does the text say about cyberbullying?

**Answer**: It's unclear what cyberbullying is. The author adds that adopting a definition of cyberbullying also (controversially) implicates the right to call someone a schmuck.

**Critique**: While the author does talk about the right to call people a "schmuck," it would be more accurate to say that any definition of cyberbullying could conflict with the First Amendment

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It suggests that the discussion about cyberbullying should focus on how defining it could potentially conflict with the First Amendment, rather than just mentioning the right to call someone a "schmuck."

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is interpreting the question in the context of a Senate bill rather than the article itself. However, it does not provide any specific information or guidance on what the article actually says about cyberbullying. Without knowing what the article states, I cannot improve the answer to accurately reflect the article's content. The critique fails to provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material.

### Sample 1348/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the historical context around the news event.

**Answer**: Numerous New York senators introduced a bill on March 30th of this year that would make it a misdemeanor to engage in cyberbullying, but failed to define what that means. This bill is patently unconstitutional, as it violates the First Amendment and doesn't provide any definition for what constitutes cyberbullying. The bill was introduced in response to a ruling in People v. Marquan M. that the state's cyberbullying law was unconstitutional. This is an attempt by the Senators to give the illusion that they care about children and will work to criminalize harmful behavior toward them. This bill has no chance of passing as it doesn't meet the constitutional requirements.

**Critique**: The input does not say the bill was introduced by "numerous New York senators" or that it was passed "March 30th"

**Rationale**: The critique points out specific inaccuracies in the answer regarding who introduced the bill and the date it was introduced. However, it does not provide the correct information or suggest what should replace these inaccuracies. Without knowing the correct details about who introduced the bill and when, I cannot improve the answer. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to correct these inaccuracies.

**Answer**: He does not feel any of the feelings that are usually associated with death. He only feels weary.

**Critique**: The answer could specify the feelings that are usually associated with death: that it is pain, agony, fear, and sadness.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests specifying the feelings typically associated with death, such as pain, agony, fear, and sadness. This provides enough information to improve the answer by adding these specific feelings to contrast with the protagonist's sentiment. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it allows for a concrete improvement without needing to refer back to the source material.

The dog reminded him of the fortune he once had and lost at a snap of a finger. The old man sold the dog to a man who wanted it. He invested the money into nanotechnology, which turned him into a billionaire.

**Critique**: mention his feelings at the ending.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests adding information about the old homeless man's feelings at the ending of the story. However, it does not specify what those feelings are, leaving the editor without enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer. Without knowing the specific feelings or emotions the old man experiences at the end, the editor would need to refer back to the source material to accurately incorporate this detail.

**Answer**: The young tailored man loves dogs and always loved the black Labrador that was our homeless man's companion. He wants to buy it.

**Critique**: The tailored man had a dog that looked the same.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the young tailored man had a dog that looked the same as the black Labrador, which implies a connection based on familiarity or nostalgia rather than a desire to purchase the dog. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the motivation of the young tailored man from wanting to buy the dog to having a personal connection due to his past dog. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it provides enough information to improve the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: The young tailored man loved a black Labrador that looked like the homeless man's dog.

**Rationale**: The critique provides new information about the young tailored man's emotional connection to a black Labrador, which is similar to the homeless man's dog. This implies that the connection between the young man and the old homeless man is not just transactional (selling the dog for $10,000) but also emotional, as the young man has a fondness for a dog that resembles the homeless man's dog. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding the emotional connection aspect.

They released their debut studio album "Things Which No One Else Should Know About" in 2015. The released singles in 2016 and 2017.

**Critique**: What happened in 2016 and 2017 isn't relevant to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on what is irrelevant to the question, which is focused on the period from 2010 to 2015. It implies that the information about 2016 and 2017 should be removed to improve the answer. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the last sentence about the singles released in 2016 and 2017.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Pocket Palma's movement toward synth pop?

**Answer**: In 2018, Papa and Vidović decided to try themselves out in synth pop after Vidović had wandered to Yugoslav synth pop playlists on YouTube. In the beginning of 2019, they decided to write about the same topics, but in Croatian instead. They released their debut single in Croatian, titled "Godišnji", under the new name Pocket Palma. They released a mini-album of the same name in May 2019. They released their debut self-titled album in Croatian for Aquarius. It consists of all songs from Godišnji, as well as four new songs.

**Critique**: The mini-album in 2019 and later events aren't relevant to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the information about the mini-album in 2019 and later events is not relevant to the question about Pocket Palma's movement toward synth pop. This implies that the answer should focus on the initial decision and actions taken by Papa and Vidović to explore synth pop, rather than subsequent releases. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the details about the mini-album and later events, focusing only on their decision to try synth pop and the initial steps they took in that direction.

**Answer**: In 2018, Pocket Palma signed a contract with Croatian label Aquarius Records. In 2019, they released their debut self-titled album in Croatian for Aquarius.

**Critique**: The answer should mention the release of "Side Project" works.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should include information about the release of "Side Project" works, but it does not specify what these works are or how they relate to Pocket Palma's relationship with Aquarius Records. Without additional details, such as the nature of these works or their significance, it is not possible to improve the answer.

**Answer**: The tea was made of Chacruna leaves and Syrian Rue. It made him happy because it caused him to laugh at everything for 45 minutes.

**Critique**: Change "for" to "after"

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific instruction to change the word "for" to "after" in the sentence "It made him happy because it caused him to laugh at everything for 45 minutes." This implies that the laughter occurred after 45 minutes rather than lasting for 45 minutes. This is a concrete change that can be made to improve the accuracy of the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that sphere packing is not necessarily a different field from circle packing in this context and implies that there are other more relevant fields mentioned in the passage.

**Critique**: David Mumford actually says the first seven chapters of the book are at an undergraduate level, which could be considered novice level.

**Rationale**: The critique clarifies that the first seven chapters are at an undergraduate level, which could be considered novice level. However, it does not provide information about which parts of the book exceed the abilities of a novice. Without additional information from the source, we cannot determine which chapters or sections are beyond novice level.

The Chiefs won the 1921 Western Association Championship and won the Sooner State League championship in 1922. However, the team folded after the 1952 season. The Chicks' successes include winning the Western Association title in 1921 and season attendance numbers which placed them third in the Sooner State League in 1950 and 1952.

**Critique**: The response inaccurately mentions the team as "Chiefs" but they were actually the "Chicks" at the time.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the inaccuracy in the team name, indicating that the team should be referred to as the "Chicks" instead of the "Chiefs."

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the inaccuracy in the answer. It states that the Chicks defeated the Clinton Bulldogs in 1922, not Fort Smith. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the opponent's name. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it gives enough information to make the necessary correction without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why do the police keep almost summoning "Pee Man"?

**Answer**: Then the police try to summon Dan Man, or "Super Dan", they project a giant "D" into the sky. Unfortunately they tend to do it lowercase. This makes it appear as a "p" rather than a "d" because things projected in the sky look different from different perspectives. Because of this, Super Dan warns them that they may summon "Pee Man" a pun on the letter "P". 

**Critique**: This is incorrect

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is incorrect but does not provide any information or implications about what the correct answer might be. Without additional details or guidance, it is impossible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand why the police keep almost summoning "Pee Man."

Why is the protagonist behaving in such a self-destructive way?

**Answer**: The protagonist is behaving in self-destructive ways because he believes he is trapped in an alternate reality. In this alternate reality, he believes his face is on fire and that he is someone else- specifically Stephen King. This confusion has driven him to behave erratically in order to escape this alternate reality.

**Critique**: The response does not mention that the narrator is putting himself in a trance to create his newest character for his new book. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It mentions that the protagonist is putting himself in a trance to create a new character for his book.

### Sample 1372/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is the protagonist behaving in such a self-destructive way?

**Answer**: The protagonist is behaving in such a self-destructive way because he appears to be experiencing delusions brought on by some sort of break with reality. He goes to the bathroom and upon looking in the mirror sees a mangled face that is not his own. He then picks up a wallet and sees the name "Stephen King" on the identification, leading him to believe that he is that author. The pain in his face combined with his delusions leaves him entirely disconnected from reality, prompting him to scream and smash things. This detachment from reality also leads him to destroy himself.

**Critique**: The response does not mention that the protagonist has put himself in a trance to create his newest character, Alfred Jones. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the protagonist has put himself in a trance to create a new character, Alfred Jones. This detail can be directly incorporated into the answer to improve it by explaining the protagonist's self-destructive behavior as part of his creative process.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the protagonist is Stephen King, who is in a trance trying to live as his newest character, Alfred Jones. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the misunderstanding of the protagonist's identity and clarifying his behavior. The revised answer can now accurately reflect that the protagonist's self-destructive behavior is due to his attempt to embody his character, Alfred Jones, while in a trance.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the part of the answer about the protagonist wanting to wake up to avoid feeling pain is incorrect. This allows for a concrete improvement by removing or correcting that specific part of the answer. However, the critique does not provide information on what the correct motivation for wanting to wake up is, beyond the protagonist's desire to know who he is.

**Critique**: The text does not transition well. It does not explain that the narrator has put himself in a trance for his new book character. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer lacks a transition and fails to explain that the narrator has put himself in a trance for his new book character. This suggests that the answer should include information about the narrator's intentional trance state for character development. However, the critique does not provide specific details on how to incorporate this information or what the transition should entail.

He realized that he needed to stop worrying about the past and the future and focus on what is happening now.

**Critique**: Omit the parts that do not involve drugs (such as the reason why the writer started taking drugs) and mention the parts where they talk about wanting to own marijuana and other drug related content.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by omitting irrelevant parts and including specific content related to drugs.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests including information about the possible earnings of a marijuana grower. However, it does not provide any specific details or figures about these earnings. Without access to the source material, it is impossible to know what the article says about the earnings of a marijuana grower. Therefore, I cannot improve the answer based on the critique alone.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about drugs?

**Answer**: The author has had a very shitty year since January 1st, 2018. He lost his grandmother and his mother at a very young age, and he was in a deep depression. He moved away from his hometown to Chewelah, Washington, and his life got even worse. He started drinking a tea made of Chacruna Leaves and Syrian Rue, and it made him happy. He realized that he worried too much about what other people thought of him, and what was in his future. He realized that he needed to stop worrying about the past and the future and focus on what is happening now. He thinks that he might not quit drugs completely, but he wants to find things in the real world that make him happy.

**Critique**: Omit the parts that do not involve drugs (such as the reason why the writer started taking drugs) and mention the parts where they talk about wanting to own marijuana and other drug related content.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by omitting irrelevant parts and including specific content related to drugs. It suggests removing the personal background information and focusing on the author's intentions regarding marijuana and other drug-related content. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why did Beverly Duan donate to charity in China during the COVID-19 pandemic?

**Answer**: She believes people can change the world when they work together. She also donated because she is half Chinese and she was born in America.

**Critique**: There is no evidence that the fact that she was born in America was a contributing factor.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that there is no evidence supporting the claim that being born in America was a contributing factor to Beverly Duan's decision to donate to charity in China. This implies that the part of the answer stating "she was born in America" should be removed or revised. However, the critique does not provide an alternative reason or confirm what the correct contributing factors are, leaving the editor without enough information to improve the answer regarding why she donated. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without consulting the source material.

**Critique**: This response just needs to elaborate and say that there is no response to this question to be found in the article. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the article does not contain information about life expectancy in Toronto after de Villa became the medical officer. This implies that the answer should explicitly state that the article does not address this topic.

**Critique**: This fails to answer the question

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer fails to address the question, which is about the narrator's inability to approach and talk to the girl. However, the critique does not provide any information or suggestions on how to improve the answer or what specific aspects of the narrator's inability should be addressed.

### Sample 1394/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the possible messages hidden in the narrator's dreams about the girl?

**Answer**: The narrator dreams about the girl because she still feels connected to her yet she was gone from his reality. He believes there must be something more to the dreams, perhaps a deeper message about the girl and their relationship. Maybe it might be a sign that the girl could come back into his life or that they could have a future together. Whatever it is, the dreams beg the question of what could have been had he said something to her at the park.

**Critique**: Incorrect use of the pronoun

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that there is an incorrect use of the pronoun in the answer. This implies that the gender of the narrator or the girl might be incorrectly represented. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by using gender-neutral pronouns ("they" or "them") to ensure correctness. This adjustment addresses the critique directly.

### Sample 1395/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the possible messages hidden in the narrator's dreams about the girl?

**Answer**: The narrator's first dream where the girl spoke to him was probably meant to show him that she was already spoken for and happy with her life. The girl appeared to have a husband and two kids. They all looked so happy, with no troubles in the world. The narrator's second dream was probably meant to tell him "that's life" and he should move on with his.

**Critique**: This is confusing. It sounds as though he had dreamt that the girl had a husband. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer is confusing because it seems to suggest that the narrator dreamt the girl had a husband. However, it does not provide enough information to clarify or correct the confusion. The critique does not specify what the correct interpretation of the dream should be or how to rephrase the answer to make it clearer. Without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to improve the answer based solely on the critique.

**Answer**: The dreams suggest that the narrator misses the girl and their brief time together had an impact on him. The dreams also point to the possibilities of infidelity and divorce between the girl and her partner. The dreams are a reflection of the emptiness in the narrator's life without her in it and also highlight the regret and confusion he feels in light of her absence.

**Critique**: This is not implied anywhere in the text

**Rationale**: The critique states that the interpretation provided in the answer is not implied anywhere in the text. However, it does not offer any guidance or alternative interpretation of what the dreams might suggest.

### Sample 1398/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the narrator?

**Answer**: The narrator is a man in his 20s. He lives alone and could be a likely shut-in due to his lack of friends. He has a cat that he presumably adores. He's physically able, which is shown with his frantic run. There's a possibility that he might be unemployed or not in school, because he seems to be able to spend much of the day in the same park he's been going to for too long. On rainy days, he instead goes to a cafe to sit down, because it's better to be outside. The narrator doesn't seem to have many friends.

**Critique**: The narrator says he's a writer

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the narrator identifies as a writer. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding this detail about the narrator's occupation or self-identification. The critique implies that the current answer is missing this important aspect of the narrator's identity, which can be directly incorporated into the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1399/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the narrator?

**Answer**: The narrator is a writer. One day, they spot a woman reading at a park they regularly visit. Every day they keep an eye on her, knowing that one day they should talk. The narrator fantasizes about asking her out. One day the girl's husband shows up with the woman and two children. She appears to be very happy. The narrator is disappointed but does not give up waiting for her to come again. A few days later, the man never sees the woman again at the park.

**Critique**: "A few days later" and "never" conflict

**Rationale**: The critique points out a specific inconsistency in the timeline of the narrative, indicating that the phrases "a few days later" and "never" are contradictory. This implies that the timeline needs to be clarified or corrected. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by resolving this contradiction. For example, I could change "A few days later, the man never sees the woman again at the park" to "After that day, the man never sees the woman again at the park," which removes the conflict between "a few days later" and "never."

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the narrator?

**Answer**: The narrator seems lonely. He goes to the park every day just to stare at a girl he never had the intention of saying hi to, which means he's also a little creepy. He was weird because he would laugh whenever the girl dropped something (like he knows her or is in on a joke) and get disappointed whenever he lost sight of her. It appears that he lives alone, has no love life, and only has a cat for company. 

**Critique**: A little clumsy

**Rationale**: The critique "A little clumsy" does not provide specific information or guidance on how to improve the answer. It does not indicate which parts of the answer are clumsy or suggest any specific changes. Without additional details or suggestions, it is not possible to make a concrete improvement to the answer based solely on the critique.

**Critique**: There is no evidence that these people attended

This implies that the part of the answer claiming their attendance should be removed or corrected. However, the critique does not provide information on who actually attended, if anyone, or any other details about the event.

She regrets not throwing away the plates and silverware, but also realizes she wanted them to match the dining room.Thus, she resolves to leave most of her stuff and tells the husand goodbye.

**Critique**: The response does not mention that she is leaving her husband. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer does not mention that the narrator is leaving her husband. This implies that the answer should explicitly state that the narrator is leaving her husband as part of the packing process. The critique provides enough information to make this specific improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

They write a postcard saying they'll be away from their possessions. They think it would be good to go.

**Critique**: The narrator is not procrastinating packing, she is deciding whether she should even bring her things with her or just leave her husband with everything. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts the current answer, indicating that the narrator is not procrastinating but is instead contemplating whether to bring her belongings or leave them with her husband. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the focus from procrastination to decision-making about the belongings. The critique implies that the narrator's actions are more about making a decision rather than delaying packing, which can be directly incorporated into the revised answer.

She eventually decides to take only the clock before moving on to something new.

**Critique**: She has not moved out of the apartment yet. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts a part of the current answer. It states that the narrator has not moved out of the apartment yet, which allows for a concrete improvement to the answer.

She feels conflicted about leaving the apartment she is currently living in and picks up some boxes in preparation for this. Even though there is nothing left for her in the apartment, she does not know if taking her belongings along with her from place to place will really achieve anything. The narrator also feels conflicted about her relationship and is wondering if her partner's betrayal was her fault. She decides that leaving everything behind is the best option and is unsure of what awaits her. She knows she will take the clock with her as a memento of her current life. Ultimately, the narrator plans to leave the apartment behind and start a new life somewhere else.

**Critique**: Most of the response is irrelevant to the narrator's plans for the future.

**Rationale**: The critique states that most of the response is irrelevant to the narrator's plans for the future, but it does not specify which parts are irrelevant or what should be included instead.

**Answer**: The narrator wants to gather and pack the things they need and leave this place behind. They think they'll walk east to escape their current life. They are planning to change their look and make a new life. They want to leave this place and hopefully find more joy on the road. The narrator wants to leave this place for its memories of their partner that may make them feel sad. The narrator is planning on taking the books and their emotions with them no matter what. The narrator wishes they could just change the way they are or start anew.

**Critique**: "They" and "The narrator" are being used too often and make the response sound clunky. Certain sentences that convey the same idea can be combined instead. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific feedback on the style and structure of the answer, suggesting that the frequent use of "they" and "the narrator" makes the response sound clunky and that some sentences could be combined to improve flow. This feedback allows for concrete improvements to be made to the answer by rephrasing sentences to reduce repetition and combining similar ideas for better coherence. For example, sentences about leaving the place and starting anew can be merged to create a more fluid narrative.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything relating to the narrator's plans for the future.

**Answer**: The narrator does not seem to have one over all. He would rather leave than pack. He would rather walk and figure things out than carry them with him. He does not seem to have a clear idea of where he is going in life, but he knows he wants to go somewhere new on a journey of self-discovery. If anything, the narrator is looking for that one last adventure before she settles and gets old.

**Critique**: The gender change in the last sentence makes the whole response confusing. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out a specific issue with the answer: the inconsistency in the narrator's gender. This implies that the gender reference should be consistent throughout the answer. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by choosing a single pronoun (either "he" or "she") and using it consistently throughout the response.

### Sample 1415/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the plot of the story.

**Answer**: Virgil is a 35-year-old man who grew up in the ghetto behind Zulu, an amusement park. He never had the chance to visit the park as a child, but he did go there as a teenager to buy and sell drugs to suburbanites. He is now a respectable man with a good job and a house in the suburbs. He takes his son, Wayne, to Zulu, and they go on a go-kart ride.

**Critique**: The summary of the plot should show more context as opposed to just showing content. The main plot of the passage revolves around the fact that Virgil is making his relationship with his son work. So the summary needs to focus on that point more. The summary should have more about their interaction.  

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the summary should focus more on the relationship between Virgil and his son, Wayne, and their interactions. However, it does not provide specific details or examples of their interactions or how the relationship is being made to work. Without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to concretely improve the summary to focus on their relationship and interactions.

### Sample 1418/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Virgil's relationship with the Zulu amusement park.

**Answer**: Virgil had been born into the ghetto that sprawled behind the zig-zag shadows of Zulu's dilapidated roller coasters. As a very young child, that park represented the promise of magic, adventure and mystery. He'd never had the chance or, later, the inclination to ride a single ride. He had a good job and a respectable house in the suburbs. He was driving down the freeway with his youngest son, Wayne, and the child made a curious noise when they passed the almost illegibly weathered sign for "Zulu! Live the Adventure!" Virgil checked the mirrors and exited the freeway. "You want to live the adventure, little man?"

**Critique**: There should be more context instead of just pasting what is in the passage. Zulu's place in Virgil's life evolves over time and the summary show that in full. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the summary should reflect the evolution of Zulu's place in Virgil's life over time. However, it does not provide specific details or guidance on how to achieve this. Without access to the source material, it is unclear how Zulu's place in Virgil's life evolves beyond what is already mentioned in the answer.

### Sample 1420/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Virgil's relationship with the Zulu amusement park.

**Answer**: Virgil grew up in the ghetto behind Zulu. He never got to visit the park as a child because he was too old to believe in voodoo or hippopotamuses. As a teenager, he went to Zulu to buy weight and sell dime bags to suburbanites from Fort Worth. He never rode a single ride. Now, he takes his son to Zulu to relive his past.

**Critique**: A bit more detail with him and Wayne in Zulu would bring the narrative summary full circle. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests adding more detail about Virgil's interactions with Wayne at the Zulu amusement park to enhance the narrative. However, it does not provide specific information about what those details might be. Without access to the source material, it is impossible to know what specific interactions or details should be included to improve the answer.

Summarize everything relating to the author's opinion of Donald Trump. 

**Answer**: The author describes Trump as having a public and private face, and that there is only so much filter that can be removed when there's hardly any filter to start with. The author also describes Trump as an authoritarian, and that he is growing increasingly frustrated with the shackles his chief of staff, John Kelly, has imposed on him.

**Critique**: The response includes extraneous information not useful for the task. Trump's frustrations are not the authors opinion.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the information about Trump's frustrations is not relevant to the author's opinion, which is the focus of the question. This implies that the part about Trump's frustrations should be removed to better align the answer with the task. The critique provides enough guidance to make a concrete improvement by removing the irrelevant information.

### Sample 1423/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything relating to Jonathan Demme's filmography.

**Answer**: Jonathan Demme, the director of this movie, also directed two other film: The Manchurian Candidate and Rachel Getting Married. His artistic talents have been used on a few more occasions because a song, Hoover Old Start, by Robyn Hitchcock was featured in the film The Truth About Charlie. He also cast Hitchcock in a small role (presumably as himself) in another film. Jonathan Demme had no direct involvement in his first two films or the song, but Hitchcock liked Demme's style and subsequently invited him to film his performance on the side of a concert.

**Critique**: The last sentence is incoherent

**Rationale**: The critique identifies that the last sentence is incoherent, which implies that it should be revised or removed to improve clarity. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can take action by either rephrasing the sentence to make it coherent or removing it entirely if it does not contribute meaningfully to the summary. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer based on the critique provided.

### Sample 1424/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything relating to Jonathan Demme's filmography.

**Answer**: Jonathan Demme first met Robyn Hitchcock after attending a live show that Robyn Hitchcock was performing in. Demme then offered to direct a live performance video for a song, which was then to become the full concert from Storefront Hitchcock. Hitchcock starred in Demme's two other films: The Manchurian Candidate and Rachel Getting Married. Demme used one of Hitchcock's songs for The Truth about Charlie.

**Critique**: Hitchcock had small roles in the other films, and we can't conclude that those two were Demme's only other films

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It clarifies that Robyn Hitchcock had small roles in "The Manchurian Candidate" and "Rachel Getting Married," which allows for a correction in the description of Hitchcock's involvement. Additionally, the critique implies that Jonathan Demme directed more films than just the ones mentioned, suggesting that the answer should not limit Demme's filmography to only those films. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to make concrete improvements to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: On set, simple props like lights and set pieces are arranged. After the song performance is over, passers-by on the street occasionally glance in. There are several other small performances by other actors during the film.

**Critique**: The passers-by glance in not necessarily after the performance

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the passers-by glance in not necessarily after the performance, which implies that the timing of their glancing is incorrect in the current answer. Therefore, the answer can be improved by adjusting the timing of when the passers-by glance in, without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1426/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about Hitchcock as a musician?

**Answer**: Demme documented Hitchcock's minimalistic performance, shot inside a storefront. It features his songs, most notably "1974", "The Sky is Full of Space", "You and Oblivion", and "1974". The performances were praised. Hitchcock was also described as having a rich and supple voice, self-amusing between song patter, and being a smart and quirky folk-rocker in the most favorable light.

**Critique**: The list of songs is unnecessary and inaccurate

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the list of songs is both unnecessary and inaccurate. This implies that the list should be removed or corrected. Since the critique does not provide the correct list of songs or specify which part of the list is inaccurate, we cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to verify the correct information.

The wind chill dipped to an even more startling 51 degrees below zero. The National Weather Service said the temperature reached minus-28 degrees in Minneapolis, poised to break a record dating back more than 100 years. The wind chill: minus-49. Norris Camp, Minnesota, almost made it there without allowing for wind, recording an actual air temperature of 48 degrees below zero.

**Critique**: The highlighted text about Minneapolis is irrelevant to the question and should be removed. 

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the information about Minneapolis is irrelevant to the question about Chicago and should be removed. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by eliminating the unnecessary details about Minneapolis, allowing the focus to remain solely on Chicago's weather conditions.

Chicago's all-time record of minus-27 was set in 1985. The wind chill dipped to an even more startling 51 degrees below zero. The wind chill in Minneapolis reached minus-49. Chicago has closed schools for cold weather and officials placed 500 shelter beds.

**Critique**: The highlighted text is redundant and should be removed. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that the highlighted text is redundant and should be removed. However, it does not specify which part of the text is highlighted or redundant.

### Sample 1430/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the weather and the number of deaths in Chicago?

**Answer**: In Chicago, a historic and deadly cold snap gripped a wide swath of the nation on Wednesday, fueled by the polar vortex, with temperatures plunging far below zero and wind chill numbers as extraordinary as they are dangerous. The temperature in Chicago tumbled to 21 below Wednesday morning, a record for the date, and closing in on the city's all-time record of minus-27 set in 1985. That record could fall on Thursday.

**Critique**: The highlighted text is a description of the extreme weather affecting a wide swath of the nation, not just "in Chicago", which makes this part of the response contradictory. It should be revised to reflect the fact that Chicago is affected. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer incorrectly implies that the extreme weather is exclusive to Chicago, whereas it actually affects a wider area. The critique suggests revising the answer to clarify that Chicago is one of the affected areas, not the only one. This provides enough information to improve the answer by adjusting the wording to accurately reflect the scope of the weather event. For example, the answer could be revised to: "In Chicago, as part of a historic and deadly cold snap affecting a wide swath of the nation, temperatures plunged far below zero..." This revision maintains the focus on Chicago while acknowledging the broader impact.

Manigault Newman, a graduate of HBCU who spearheaded Trump's outreach to HBCUs fueled a conflict between DeVos and Manigault Newman when she told Trump to ask DeVos to move an initiative aimed to boost HBCUs. Betsy DeVos refused to give the speech at HBCU's annual conference, Manigault Newman claims.

**Critique**: This sentence's grammar needs to be altered.

**Answer**: The first seven chapters of the book

**Critique**: The answer should say that Mumford believes that the book as a whole is suitable for graduate students in math, besides the first seven chapters being an undergraduate level.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It indicates that the first seven chapters are suitable for undergraduates, while the entire book is suitable for graduate students. This implies that chapters beyond the first seven exceed the abilities of a novice. Therefore, the answer can be improved by stating that the book as a whole, beyond the first seven chapters, is suitable for graduate students, which implies that these parts exceed novice abilities.

**Answer**: According to the Republicans' publication of memos, an Australian diplomat shared an interaction he had with one of Trump's campaign advisors and their conversation suggests there was a tie between him and Russian government.

**Critique**: Specify that Papadopoulos bragged about the Russians having damaging information on Clinton before the hack.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the answer to improve it. It specifies that Papadopoulos bragged about the Russians having damaging information on Clinton before the hack, which is a concrete detail that can be included to clarify what made the FBI convinced of foreign interference. This allows for a more detailed and accurate answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Prior to obtaining any information from the Australian government, was the FBI ever planning to investigate any Russian threat to the election?

**Answer**: No, it was not.

**Critique**: It's not said specifically if they ever planned to investigate based off of the the article, so it would be better to use a speculative answer or no answer at all.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should be speculative or omitted because the article does not specifically state whether the FBI planned to investigate a Russian threat to the election. However, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without referring back to the source material. It does not specify what a speculative answer might look like or provide any alternative information that could be used to construct a better answer. Therefore, without additional details from the source, it is not possible to improve the answer based solely on the critique.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What there any personal vendetta involved in the investigation of the Trump campaign and its links with Russia?

**Answer**: The FBI agent and lawyer who exchanged private text messages during the campaign that were disparaging of Trump were on Mueller's special counsel team at one point before being reassigned.

**Critique**: It would be better to use speculative terms in this answer, since it's not concrete that there was a personal vendetta.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests using speculative terms because the existence of a personal vendetta is not concrete. This implies that the answer should be rephrased to reflect uncertainty or speculation about the personal vendetta. For example, the answer could be improved by saying, "There were private text messages exchanged by an FBI agent and lawyer during the campaign that were disparaging of Trump, and they were on Mueller's special counsel team at one point before being reassigned, which some speculate could indicate a personal vendetta." This change can be made without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides enough guidance on how to adjust the tone of the answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How does Marko's opinions change about being a pet through the story?

**Answer**: Marko thinks being a pet is cool at first, but as soon as he gets into the hands of the humans, he realizes that it isn't.

**Critique**: The change in Marko's opinion is that he is confused with how the humans are interacting with him, as opposed to thinking that they are not good.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about Marko's change in opinion, indicating that he is confused by the humans' interactions rather than thinking negatively about them. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by replacing the part about Marko realizing being a pet isn't cool with the information about his confusion. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it provides enough information to revise the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1451/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How does Marko's opinions change about being a pet through the story?

**Answer**: At first, he wishes to be a pet because he sees how humans live their lives. He thinks that he would be able to experience all of these new things. When he is grabbed by the humans, he cries out for his mother and screams for help, which means Marko wants to be back home with his family being a street cat. However, he realizes that he actually enjoys being a pet because of all the nice things he is experiencing. He is taken to a bathroom.

**Critique**: The answer should only include what is in the narrative, Marko deciding on what life with the humans is like is not yet determined. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the part of the answer where Marko decides he enjoys being a pet is not supported by the narrative. This implies that the answer should be revised to exclude any conclusion about Marko's enjoyment of being a pet. The critique provides enough information to improve the answer by removing the unsupported statement about Marko's enjoyment, focusing instead on his initial wish to be a pet and his subsequent fear when grabbed by humans. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it guides the removal of specific content that is not determined by the narrative.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Mike's relationship with Sharon?

**Answer**: Friends' talk on a text message and Mike diverts it to a sexual level. After many texts, Sharon invites him over to the hotel she is staying at and Mike welcomes the invitation by asking if he can visit her. But Mike is apprehensive about their relationship. He has been encountering women for a long time but only tries to go for those with whom he has established a solid rapport. Mike pretends that he does not want their relationship to be sexual.

**Critique**: The sentence is hard to read. It must indicate Mike and Sharon are trying to be friends. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the sentence is hard to read and implies that the relationship between Mike and Sharon should be framed as them trying to be friends. This provides enough information to improve the answer by rephrasing the sentence to emphasize the friendship aspect. For example, the answer could be revised to: "Mike and Sharon are trying to be friends, but their text conversation takes a sexual turn. Despite this, Mike is apprehensive about their relationship becoming sexual, as he values establishing a solid rapport with women before pursuing anything further." This revision aligns with the critique's implication without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: Sharon and Mike are friends who are trying to be mates. At some point, Mike falls for Sharon's charms. He invites Sharon to his hotel room for a drink, but she thinks he is exaggerating and only wants a chat. However, when Sharon arrives and Mike wishes a good night, she shows some enthusiasm and agrees to join him.

**Critique**: "At some point, Mike falls for Sharon's charms." - this is inaccurate. Sharon wasn't trying to charm Mike. He was the one flirting with her. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the statement "Mike falls for Sharon's charms" is inaccurate because Sharon was not trying to charm Mike; instead, Mike was the one flirting with her. This implies that the sentence should be revised to reflect that Mike was the one initiating the flirtation, not responding to Sharon's charms. Therefore, the critique gives enough information to adjust the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

What does the story say about Mike's relationship with Sharon?

**Answer**: Sharon and Mike are friends who are trying to be mates. Sharon shows some enthusiasm when she arrives and Mike invites her to his hotel room for a drink. However, she reacts cautiously at first but still agrees to join him.

**Critique**: This is inaccurate. Sharon never showed enthusiasm anywhere, let alone when she arrived. 

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that Sharon never showed enthusiasm, which directly contradicts the statement in the answer that "Sharon shows some enthusiasm when she arrives." This allows for a concrete improvement by removing or correcting the part about Sharon's enthusiasm. However, the critique does not provide information on what Sharon's actual demeanor was, so while it allows for the removal of the incorrect information, it does not provide enough detail to fully correct the answer without consulting the source material for Sharon's actual behavior.

He has invited her over for drinks, but secretly prepared a room complete with roses, chocolate, and champagne. However, he believes that since she's shown up, it means she will have sex with him.

**Critique**: "and hang out" - this is inaccurate. It was never mentioned if the two have hung out before.

**Rationale**: The critique specifically points out that the phrase "and hang out" is inaccurate because it was never mentioned if Mike and Sharon have hung out before. This provides clear guidance on what part of the answer needs to be corrected. By removing the phrase "and hang out," the answer can be improved without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Sharon's character?

**Answer**: Sharon lives in the same building as Mike, and has been exchanging flirtatious statements with him through text messaging. When Mike finally asks her out for a drink, she agrees and is going toward the entrance of Mike's building. However, before Sharon can say anything, Mike thinks he hears Mike calling her name, causing him to answer her text hurriedly, and then crashes into her. Taboo as his wings of fantasy might be, their chemistry is certainly tangible and one wonders if Sharon cannot resist the masculine, come-to-bed dude she picks up from the streets in no time. She is beautiful in Mike's eyes, and the enormous gap between fantasy and reality frankly does not exist for him.

**Critique**: The entire response is pure fantasy and never happened. Also, the story doesn't give enough details about Sharon to draw conclusions about her character because Mike seems to be the main character.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the entire response is fictional and not based on the actual story, and it also points out that the story doesn't provide enough details about Sharon to draw conclusions about her character. However, the critique does not provide any specific information or suggestions on what the correct details about Sharon's character are.

Sharon appears to be beautiful, knows Mike really well, as they text and he tells her not to expect sex, but she states she is confident and wants to test out the chemistry they both know they have stored up. The friends get to the hotel room only a few minutes after Sharon arrives.

**Critique**: The response is incorrect because the story didn't happen that way at all. Plus, the response doesn't really say anything about Sharon's character because the story is primarily about Mike.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the response is incorrect and that the story is primarily about Mike, not Sharon. However, it does not provide any specific information about Sharon's character or how to correct the inaccuracies in the answer. Without additional details or guidance on what aspects of Sharon's character should be highlighted, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Answer**: It is implied in the text that Sharon is shy (or doesn't want to admit to being attracted to anyone) as it took her 8 minutes and 30 seconds to get to the hotel. She also seems socially awkward in the interaction, e.g. tripping on her own foot and flushing bright red at Mike's compliment. She appears to like Mike as she later states she is glad he was brave enough to accept her invitation, but seemingly gave in.

**Critique**: The response is incorrect because the story never happened that way. Sharon's character isn't really mentioned anywhere. 

**Rationale**: The critique states that the story never happened as described in the answer and that Sharon's character isn't mentioned anywhere.

**Critique**: How to help the animals is irrelevant to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the information about how to help the animals is irrelevant to the question, which asks for a summary of the hardships faced by Australian animals during summers.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about why Thompson wants to fight Lawler?

**Answer**: Thompson wants to fight Lawler because he's has been a "monster" in the welterweight division. He hasn't had a fight in 10 months and wants a strong case to challenge the current titleholder, Kamaru Usman. He sees a fight against Lawler as a way to prove his worth as a contender again.

**Critique**: he's a former Welterweight champion

**Rationale**: The critique provides additional information that Thompson is a former Welterweight champion. This information can be used to improve the answer by adding context to Thompson's motivation for wanting to fight Lawler. Specifically, it implies that Thompson's desire to fight Lawler is not only about proving his worth but also about reclaiming his status as a top contender in the division.

To win a fight with someone at their top of their game is a good way to showcase a comeback. Thompson has been away from the spotlight for 10 months and so is ready to make a statement with his return. He believes fighting Lawler will help accomplish that.

**Critique**: This is not causative.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is "not causative," but it does not provide specific guidance on how to correct or improve the answer. It points out a flaw but does not suggest what the causative reason might be or how to reframe the answer to address this issue. Without additional information or context from the source material, it is unclear how to revise the answer to meet the critique's implied standard of causation.

**Answer**: Thompson wants the hometown showdown with Lawler so he can fight Lawler in his home town. Cross the river and into the woods, he trusts the matchup would make all the other fighters forget about him and reinstate him as a contender for the welterweight title. Thompson has been waiting for this fight for years, and it hasn't ever come to fruition. Thompson's been wanting the fight for sometime as Lawler and Thompson are both welterweight fighters and want to fight each other.

**Critique**: This is a nice detail in the story but not a primary reason. It should be removed

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that a specific detail in the answer is not a primary reason for Thompson wanting to fight Lawler and suggests it should be removed.

The latest UN investigation, which found the US is likely complicit in war crimes, should give new momentum to the majority in Congress that wants to end American involvement in a disastrous conflict.

**Critique**: The US' complicity in war crimes isn't relevant to the question.

The narrator and a man he considers to be his brother were deployed to Ukraine where they fought side by side in a conflict that only the two of them would understand. They shared bullets, bottles, and blood.

**Critique**: Not only the two of them would understand. It should be mentioned that other members of their company are also brothers.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It suggests that the statement "only the two of them would understand" is incorrect and implies that the sense of brotherhood extends to other members of their company. Therefore, the answer can be improved by including this information about the broader sense of brotherhood among the company members.

Summarize how the story ends.

**Answer**: The story ends with the narrator and his former brother in arms, who has become a nationalist, standing in an airport. The narrator is not sure if the man will shoot him, but he does not. The nationalist says that they were brothers once, and that is enough. The narrator looks down at his dog tags, and realizes that no one will remember what they did there.

**Critique**: It should be mentioned that the nationalist walks away and into the crowd.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What are the downsides Voynov faces for beating his wife?

**Answer**: He's currently suspended without pay indefinitely. Voynov is an immigrant, which means that he can be deported. His contract with NHL is at risk of termination, and he can face up to four years in prison. Furthermore, should the photos of his wife's injuries leak to the public, he'd be under public backlash too.

**Critique**: Change 'four' to 'nine' to include the potential for 'great bodily injury' determined as part of the ruling.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It instructs to change "four" to "nine" years in prison to account for the potential for "great bodily injury" as part of the ruling.

**Answer**: Voynov faces both prison time and the risk of being deported due to the charge of domestic violence. While the violence is disturbing and abhorrent, the other potential consequences of Voynov's crime could be even more devastating.

**Critique**: The second sentence is opinion that doesn't reflect the factual nature of the article (even if it was the article's stance, that should be recognized instead of repeated), so remove it.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the second sentence is opinion-based and should be removed to maintain the factual nature of the answer. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by removing the specified sentence. Therefore, the critique allows for a concrete improvement without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything related to the girl.

**Answer**: The girl is 12 years old and she was the sole survivor of an apocalyptic event that was orchestrated by rich people who fled. The girl claims that there is a way to stop these invaders and when the invaders came, her prediction was proven to be true. She lashed out at one of the soldiers, impaling him with her arm and the soldier died. The girl does not seem trustworthy and is warning of a serious threat that needs to be taken seriously.

**Critique**: The girl is not the sole survivor

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that directly contradicts a part of the current answer. It states that the girl is not the sole survivor, which allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing or correcting the statement about her being the sole survivor.

Upon seeing a human form in the distance and mistaking it for a threat, the girl uses her arm as monsters against David, killing him. The girl simply says: They are coming.

**Critique**: She does not lead David on patrol

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the statement "the girl leads David on patrol" is incorrect.

### Sample 1491/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about the state of the earth?

**Answer**: The text mentions various states. 

The earth is a wasteland devoid of life. 

The area to which Sgt. Johnson patrols with his squadron is a wasteland devoid of life. 

There seems to be inhabited human settlements elsewhere outside this area. 

Therefore is seems that only a fraction of the earth's surface is inhabitable, but there is no mention of how this came to be, so it might be possible that there was nuclear warfare which would explain the dead planet and radiation.

**Critique**: It was mentioned how this came about.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the text does mention how the state of the earth came about, but it does not provide any specific information or details about what that explanation is. Without knowing what the text says about how the earth became a wasteland, I cannot improve the answer to include this information. The critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material.

### Sample 1503/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is Jerry's role in the story?

**Answer**: Jerry is the protagonist and villain in the story. He's a serial killer living his life as a loner and an outcast. He moves across different cities and states in the U.S. using an old map and picks up women. Jerry takes these women on dates to get to know them better before he kills them. He never sleeps with the women he kills as a sign of respect, but it may have a deeper meaning (speculation: possibly sexual frustration).

**Critique**: This is unnecessary for the answer. It would be better to omit.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the information provided in the answer is unnecessary and suggests that it would be better to omit it. However, the critique does not specify which parts of the answer are unnecessary or what should be included instead. Without knowing which specific details are unnecessary or what the correct information should be, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer.

### Sample 1504/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What motivates Jerry to kill all these women?

**Answer**: Jerry murders these women out of guilt for abandoning his previous lover, Beth, and overwhelming loneliness and longing for companionship. The lure of a new potential relationship helps justify his actions.

**Critique**: This answer is said definitively, when the story does not totally specify what his motivation is. Additionally, the answer wouldn't be that Jerry feels guilt for abandoning Beth, because it seems that Beth left him. The motivation could be Beth and just a general desire to kill women.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is stated too definitively and suggests that the motivation provided (guilt for abandoning Beth) is incorrect because Beth left Jerry. It implies that the motivation could be related to Beth in some other way or a general desire to kill women. However, the critique does not provide a clear, specific alternative motivation that can be directly used to improve the answer. It leaves the motivation open-ended, which means I would need to refer back to the source material to determine the correct motivation.

### Sample 1505/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What motivates Jerry to kill all these women?

**Answer**: Not stated explicitly, but it seems he gets a sadistic thrill from killing women.

**Critique**: It's omitted that his motivations could also come from heartache from Beth.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests an additional motivation for Jerry's actions, specifically heartache from Beth. This provides a specific detail that can be incorporated into the answer to improve it. The editor can revise the answer to include both the sadistic thrill and the heartache from Beth as potential motivations, without needing to refer back to the source material for further clarification.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 1506/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What motivates Jerry to kill all these women?

**Answer**: Jerry's possible motivation for killing women in each of the cities he visits is Beth. She was Jerry's lover and wanted to travel to different cities with him. Beth used the old map and marked all the places she wanted to go to. Something may have happened to Beth (Speculation: she died or maybe Jerry killed her despite loving her) and now Jerry is fulfilling their plan to visit all the places on the map. Since Beth is no longer with him, Jerry looks for women who can be with him, then kills them before moving on to another city.

**Critique**: This is too assumptive. There are not enough details in the story to assume all of this. Most likely, Beth left him as there is a note that says "I have to do this, I'm sorry". It would be better to omit.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the current answer is based on assumptions not supported by the story's details and provides an alternative explanation that Beth likely left Jerry, as indicated by a note. This implies that the speculative elements about Beth's death or Jerry's motivations should be removed. The critique provides enough information to improve the answer by focusing on the note as a key detail, which suggests a different motivation for Jerry's actions. Therefore, the answer can be improved by omitting the speculative parts and focusing on the note as a potential motivator.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 1507/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What motivates Jerry to kill all these women?

**Answer**: He decides to kill all these women because of the pain he has suffered in the past. He has grown to cherish the women that he's killed. Jerry feels he needs to do this so he can end his pain.

**Critique**: This should be stated in speculative terms as its never stated definitevly where Jerry's motivations are in the story.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should be rephrased to reflect the speculative nature of Jerry's motivations, as they are not definitively stated in the story. This implies that the current answer should be modified to use language that indicates uncertainty or speculation, such as "it seems," "it is possible that," or "one might infer that." This guidance allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 1508/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What motivates Jerry to kill all these women?

**Answer**: Jerry kills these women in order to make himself happy. He does not consider the emotional or physical harm he causes to these women and is driven purely by selfish reasons.

**Critique**: It's not stated explicitly in the story why Jerry kills, so it would be better to use speculative terms in the answer.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests using speculative terms because the story does not explicitly state Jerry's motivations. This implies that the answer should be rephrased to reflect uncertainty or speculation about Jerry's motivations. For example, the answer could be improved by saying, "It is possible that Jerry kills these women to make himself happy, as he seems driven by selfish reasons, without considering the emotional or physical harm he causes." This change can be made without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides enough guidance on how to adjust the language to reflect speculation.

### Sample 1509/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer?

**Answer**: Jerry grew up a loner and had a strong hatred of guns. Unbeknownst to others around them, the victim usually revealed he had a problem that could be fixed, which led to their death. Jerry does not torture his victims, but makes their deaths quick and painless. Jerry tearfully kills his victims after bonding with them first. These factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer.

**Critique**: None of these factors led to Jerry being a serial killer. This should be omitted. Additionally, the answer should be in speculative terms as it's not stated explicitly in the text.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the factors listed in the answer did not lead Jerry to become a serial killer and suggests that the answer should be framed in speculative terms. However, it does not provide any specific alternative factors or speculative reasons that could be included in the answer. Without additional information or guidance on what speculative terms to use, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the name "Mitch" in the answer is incorrect and should be replaced with "Jerry."

### Sample 1511/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer?

**Answer**: Jerry was driven to become a serial killer by a desire for the attention and approval he lacked in childhood. He was driven to kill after each of his early interactions resulted in him being rejected. This led him to seek validation and satisfaction through murder.

**Critique**: This answer is  off base, as there is no mention of a desire for approval or validation. Jerry was just a loner intentionally it seemed. Additionally, the answer should be in speculative terms.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer is incorrect because it mentions motivations (desire for attention and approval) that are not present in the source material. It also suggests that Jerry was a loner by choice and that the answer should be framed in speculative terms. However, the critique does not provide specific alternative motivations or speculative language to use. Without knowing what the correct motivations are or how to phrase the answer speculatively, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

### Sample 1512/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer?

**Answer**: It appears that he became a serial killer due to the chronic bullying he received from his peers when he was a child.

**Critique**: Since the answer isn't specifically stated in the story it would be better to use slightly more speculative language.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests using more speculative language because the answer is not explicitly stated in the story. This implies that the current answer should be modified to reflect uncertainty or speculation. For example, the answer could be revised to say, "It seems that chronic bullying from his peers during childhood may have contributed to his becoming a serial killer." This change can be made without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides clear guidance on how to adjust the language.

### Sample 1513/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What factors drove Jerry to become a serial killer?

**Answer**: Jerry was a loner and outcast. Kids always made fun of him for never being interested in any girls when most others had hit puberty. By all accounts, it appears Jerry was bullied by the other kids. Jerry was even shot in the leg one time when the kids were using real guns to shoot blanks at him, and one of the guns had a live bullet. 

**Critique**: Since the answer isn't specifically stated in the story it would be better to use  more speculative language.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should use more speculative language because the factors driving Jerry to become a serial killer are not explicitly stated in the story. This implies that the current answer presents the information too definitively. To improve the answer, I can adjust the language to reflect speculation rather than certainty, such as using phrases like "it is possible that" or "may have contributed to." This change can be made without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides clear guidance on the type of language to use.

### Sample 1517/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize Primož's strategic importance.

**Answer**: Primož is part of a ridge which separates the Pivka basin from the Reka valley. It possesses a commanding view over the entire Pivka basin, making it an important military location. During the Second World War, it was fortified with tunnels as part of the Alpine Wall, yet they were never used in combat. In total, the tunnels were more than two kilometers long, but they have since been abandoned. Today, it is made accessible by marked trails, with one specifically designated for tourists and containing numerous information signs around its peak. Primož's strategic importance stems from its commanding view and its military tunnels.

**Critique**: "which separates" - change to "that separates"

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific grammatical correction, suggesting a change from "which separates" to "that separates." This is a clear and actionable instruction that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique directly indicates what needs to be changed, making it possible to enhance the answer using only the information provided.

### Sample 1518/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the military tunnels in Primož?

**Answer**: Primož hill became Italian territory after World War 1. The tunnels in Primož were built as part of the Italian's defensive long Alpine Wall. The tunnels had two major lines, one running along the border and another several kilometers behind. After the Italians withdrew, German forces destroyed the tunnels so they could not be used against them.

**Critique**: "as part of the Italian's defensive long Alpine Wall." - needs the complete sentence from the text for added context.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the phrase "as part of the Italian's defensive long Alpine Wall" requires additional context from the source material. However, it does not provide any specific information or suggestions on how to improve the sentence without referring back to the source. Therefore, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

### Sample 1519/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the military tunnels in Primož?

**Answer**: The tunnels were dug as part of the long Alpine Wall. There were two tunnels totaling 5.2 kilometers along with brick-lined access shafts. They were never used for military purposes. They were built in 1930 and secured underground with steel encased in concrete with ventilation pipes and steel plates to prevent damage from aerial bombardment. Primož's military tunnels were destroyed by German forces in 1944.

**Critique**: "totaling 5.2 kilometers" - it was never mentioned exactly how long the tunnels were in the text.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the specific detail "totaling 5.2 kilometers" is not mentioned in the text. This implies that the length of the tunnels should be removed or revised to reflect the information available. Since the critique provides a clear indication of what is incorrect, I can improve the answer by removing the specific length detail without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1520/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the military tunnels in Primož?

**Answer**: Since 1930, the tunnels in Primož were dug as a part of the long Alpine Wall, a vast set of Italian Defense fortifications. However, the tunnels were never used for military purposes. Soldiers were periodically garrisoned to guard the tunnels. The tunnels were made to withstand harsh conditions by adding plates to the tunnels and coating them in a thick layer of concrete. There were two layers of tunnels, one on the border and the second one a few kilometers behind it.

**Critique**: "Soldiers were periodically garrisoned to guard the tunnels." - extraneous information.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the information about soldiers being periodically garrisoned to guard the tunnels is extraneous. This implies that this part of the answer should be removed to improve the answer. The critique provides clear guidance on what to do without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: Primož is a high hill in the Municipality of Pivka in Inner Carniola in Slovenia. It has many marked trails and a macadamized road leading to its summit. The historical trail leading to the summit has information signs which describe its history in detail. From the peak, most of the Pivka basin can be seen, including Lake Palčje after heavy rainfall. The most steep hike to the peak is 2.3 kilometers long, taking 40 minutes to complete. Primož is easy to hike while there are no markings on the trails.

**Critique**: "most steep" - replace with "steepest"

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific correction to the wording in the answer. It suggests replacing "most steep" with "steepest," which is a clear and actionable improvement. This allows for a concrete enhancement of the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: "and they have been renovated in the present day." - there is no evidence anywhere in the text of any renovations. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about renovations lacks evidence. To improve the answer, you would remove the part about renovations since it cannot be confirmed.

**Answer**: It is the largest film dissemination effort ever in Denmark and follows four years of work mapping the collections. These films include masterpieces that have not been shown since they were first released more than a century ago. Other institutions of learning will include Danish silents in the curriculum for students of film history.

**Critique**: This fails to answer the question

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer fails to address the question, which asks for the major reasons why old, silent Danish films are being digitalized and made available for free. However, the critique does not provide any information or implications about what the correct reasons might be.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What are the major reasons why some of the old, silent Danish films are being digitalized and made available for free?

**Answer**: The curatorial process of selecting which films are put on the public site and which are restored is meticulous and considered by directors who are experts in the field. The initial purpose of digitizing all the Danish films is to make them available to the general public and to allow further study of important aspects of film history. The most important and unused gems (authentic cinema) in Danish library cannot be digitized due to technology concerns and the digitizing process, whose process remains hidden and requires specialists even in today's world.

**Critique**: Unnecessary information. Doesn't answer the question

**Rationale**: The critique states that the current answer contains unnecessary information and does not answer the question. However, it does not provide any specific guidance or information on what the major reasons for digitalizing the films are.

What does the article say about Toni Lander's private life?

**Answer**: Toni Lander was born on June 19, 1931 in Gentofte, Denmark. She was married to Harald Lander in 1950, but they divorced in 1964. In January 1966, she married Bruce Marks, an American dancer. The marriage lasted until 1971 when she divorced Marks. Lander was prevented from becoming the first female artistic director for the Royal Danish Ballet due to a rapidly developing cancer. She died in Salt Lake City on May 19, 1985.

**Critique**: Lander's marriage with Marks lasted until 1983, not 1971.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to correct the current answer. It states that Toni Lander's marriage with Bruce Marks lasted until 1983, not 1971. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by updating the year of the divorce from 1971 to 1983. No additional information from the source material is needed to make this correction.

She joined the Ballet West in Salt Lake City in 1976, where she died of cancer in May 1985.

**Critique**: It should be mentioned that Lander's debut was as Sophie in Vilhelm Christian Holm's Livjægerne paa Amager.


**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about Toni Lander's career that is not included in the current answer. It mentions her debut role as Sophie in Vilhelm Christian Holm's "Livjægerne paa Amager." This information can be directly added to the answer to improve it without needing to refer back to the source material.

What does the article say about gamers?

**Answer**: The article says that gamers have reacted negatively to the inclusion of women in _Battlefield V_ because of the #NotMyBattlefield hashtag. The author argues that this backlash is ignorant and beside the point, and that the game's developers are uninterested in taking flak for diversifying the gaming space. According to the article, the dev team itself also pushed for women in _Battlefield V_. The article also describes gamers as reacting angrily, having used the #NotMyBattlefield hashtag.

**Critique**: The answer contains information that is not relevant to answering the question.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer contains irrelevant information but does not specify which parts are irrelevant. Without knowing which specific information is deemed irrelevant, it is impossible to make a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique does not provide enough guidance to determine what should be removed or altered, and thus, the source material would be needed to understand what is relevant to the question.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about gamers?

**Answer**: The article states that some gamers have responded negatively to the inclusion of women in Battlefield V as combat soldiers but EA and DICE remain unmoved by their reaction. The developers at EA are uninterested in taking flak for including more diverse elements and feel that the inclusion of women is reasonable and plausible. According to the developer team, an overwhelming number of fans have asked for female soldiers to be included in the game. Despite complaints that this is historically inaccurate, the developer feels that gamers are uneducated and that their fictional game should be fun above all else.

**Critique**: Inclusion of information that is not strictly relevant to answering the question.

**Rationale**: The critique states that there is "inclusion of information that is not strictly relevant to answering the question," but it does not specify which parts of the answer are irrelevant. Without knowing which specific information is deemed irrelevant, I cannot determine what to remove or adjust in the answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about what happened to Celeste after she passed out?

**Answer**: When she passed out, Celeste passed out on the stairs and vomited. Her vomit smelled so bad that no one wanted to help her.

**Critique**: The response is incorrect. Celeste vomited first before becoming dizzy and passing out. Everything faded to black when she passed out and nothing more was mentioned. The story ended there. There should be no answer. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the sequence of events and the conclusion of the story. It states that Celeste vomited before passing out, and that the story ends with everything fading to black, with nothing more mentioned. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the sequence of events and acknowledging that the story provides no further information after she passes out. The critique implies that the answer should reflect the story's ending, which is that nothing more is mentioned after she passes out.

**Answer**: Celeste passed out, and then she vomited on the stairs. She lay there until she woke up and vomited again. She tried to get up and go back to the party, but she vomited once more.

**Critique**: The response is incorrect. The story ends when Celeste passes out (everything turns black), therefore nothing is known after this point. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the story ends when Celeste passes out and everything turns black, indicating that nothing is known after this point. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the details about what happened after she passed out, as they are not supported by the story.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Darcy's parties?

**Answer**: Darcy organizes parties after High School with the purpose of meeting new people and bringing a bottle to his own house decorated with pink lights and pink sparkling water dispensers. The parties are only for a male and female, kids who did not go to High School. Celeste acts as a sniper in order to find Darcy's weakness and once she has pinpointed what he likes, she uses it to get everything she needs from him.

**Critique**: The response is incorrect. It was never mentioned that the party was after high school or for kids who didn't attend. The idea of Darcy meeting new people and bringing a bottle plus his pink lights and water doesn't exist in the story. Celeste is not a sniper and she doesn't pinpoint anything. The answer needs to be nuked and revised. 

**Rationale**: The critique identifies multiple inaccuracies in the answer, stating that several elements mentioned do not exist in the story. However, it does not provide any information on what the correct details are regarding Darcy's parties. Without knowing what the story actually says about Darcy's parties, I cannot revise the answer to be accurate.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the story say about Darcy's parties?

**Answer**: Darcy's parties are in his house. The house has transformed into a delinquent ballroom. The girls dropped as low as their heels would allow; their men watched through the haze. Darcy was a dragon. A pink dragon, breathing about the toxic smoke of his habit. He was perched upon his barstool throne, positioned strategically in the centre of the room. Celeste arrives at the party and Darcy gives her a bottle of answer.

**Critique**: This part of the response is extraneous and only describes Darcy, not his parties. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that a portion of the answer is extraneous because it describes Darcy rather than his parties. This implies that the description of Darcy as a "pink dragon" and his positioning on a "barstool throne" is not relevant to the question about his parties. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the description of Darcy and focusing on the aspects of the parties themselves, such as the transformation of the house into a "delinquent ballroom" and the behavior of the guests. This allows for a more focused answer on the parties without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: Cocaine wasn't specifically mentioned. 

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that cocaine was not mentioned, which implies that the part of the answer stating "cocaine" should be removed or corrected.

However once they arrive, they are trapped in it, stuck in the pool of filth, trapped in the ever-growing desires of the folly of youth.

**Critique**: This part of the response is inaccurate. While Vanity Heights promised power and powder, it didn't favor individuals who fueled it via those means. 

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the statement about Vanity Heights favoring individuals who fuel it through power and money is inaccurate.

**Critique**: This is inaccurate as it was never implied if Darcy was with anyone at the party. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about Celeste being the only one at the party who does not belong to Darcy is inaccurate. However, it does not provide any information on what is accurate or what should replace this statement.

What does the story say about Celeste?

**Answer**: Celeste is a teenage girl who is a guest at a party in Vanity Heights. She is a good student who has aspirations of becoming a businesswoman or a lawyer. She has a habit of drinking alcohol, and she is seen drinking at the party. She is a social butterfly, and she is seen dancing with the men at the party. She also has a tendency to drink too much, and she ends up vomiting. She is seen leaving the party after vomiting and ends up passing out.

**Critique**: Celeste only becomes one when she drinks. 

**Rationale**: The critique "Celeste only becomes one when she drinks" implies that Celeste's behavior as a "social butterfly" or her tendency to drink too much and pass out is only evident when she is drinking. This suggests that the description of her as a social butterfly and her tendency to drink too much should be qualified to indicate that these behaviors are linked to her drinking. Therefore, the answer can be improved by specifying that her social behavior and excessive drinking occur when she is under the influence of alcohol.

What does the story say about Celeste?

**Answer**: Celeste is a teenage girl, who goes to a good school with an ambition to carry out business and law. She normally upholds a strict set of rules for herself. Celeste thinks that getting drunk is reckless and irresponsible so she drinks a little at a time. She is naive, trusting and hopeful at first, but soon comes to regret that decision as the vodka transforms into a vicious monster.

**Critique**: This part of the response is inaccurate. Celeste's strict set of rules was never mentioned in the story and she did not drink a little at a time. 

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the parts about Celeste's strict set of rules and her drinking a little at a time are inaccurate. This allows for a concrete improvement by removing or correcting these specific inaccuracies. However, the critique does not provide information on what should replace these inaccuracies or what is accurate about Celeste's character in these aspects.

She also hide her face when her stepsister asks her what she was doing back there. When Celeste is at the party, her friend notices a mistake with the food she packed, but it's still something she's mad at her parents over. She acts innocent when something points to her being at the party, but her friend knows more. She tries to pretend that she wasn't about to have some fun because she has school work and responsibilities, but she's unable to do so when an ominous feeling engulfs her from within.

**Critique**: The entire response has characters and events that don't exist in the story. Everything should be nuked and a new response is needed. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the entire answer is incorrect because it contains characters and events that do not exist in the story.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the people who left the boundaries of the Old Imperium?

**Answer**: Many people left the boundaries of the Old Imperium during the Scattering. Countless humans departed the Old Imperium for uncharted space, never to return. For 1,500 years, humanity explored the uncharted realms of the universe beyond the boundaries of the Old Imperium. New groups and cultures evolved. The Bene Gesserit who remained in the territories of the Old Imperium could only make vague guesses at the size of "Scattering space", as it was theoretically infinite and even the Honored Matres might not know its full extent. One clue is that the Lost Ones returning from the Scattering refer to the Old Imperium as "the million worlds" or "the million planets" - implying that Scattering space is at least several multiples larger than that.

**Critique**: This says more about the Old Imperium than those who left it. It would be better to omit.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the current answer focuses more on the Old Imperium rather than the people who left it, implying that the information about the Old Imperium is not relevant to the question. However, the critique does not provide specific guidance on what information about the people who left should be included instead. Without additional details on what aspects of the people who left should be highlighted, it is not possible to improve the answer solely based on the critique. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Answer**: The story reflects its theme by showing how war is not glorious, but rather a tragedy. The narrator is a soldier who is in a war, and he is killed by a mortar. He is then rescued by the British company steamrolling through the coastline.

**Critique**: It is not stated he is killed by a mortar

**Rationale**: The critique points out a specific inaccuracy in the answer regarding the narrator being killed by a mortar. This implies that the part of the answer stating "he is killed by a mortar" should be removed or corrected.

**Critique**: Doesn't mention that the protagonist felt the same way about Theodore as he did about Ray. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the protagonist's feelings towards Theodore are similar to those towards Ray. This implies that the answer should include a statement about the protagonist's feelings towards Ray to draw a parallel. However, without knowing what the protagonist's feelings towards Ray are, we cannot accurately add this information to the answer.

What does the text say about the USCA?

**Answer**: The US Cattlemen's Association (USCA) is a group that represents the interests of ranchers and beef producers in the US. In February 2018, they filed a petition to the USDA, arguing that lab-grown and plant-based meat startups should not be able to call their products "meat." First, in April, NCBA sent a letter to the USDA, arguing for the opposite ruling of the USCA. The more-powerful NCBA's position may be a move to halt development of fake meat startups. One of their concerns is the idea of calling these products "meat" despite that they aren't made from slaughtered animals.

**Critique**: This is about the NCBA, not the USCA. It should be omitted.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the information provided in the answer pertains to the NCBA rather than the USCA, which is the focus of the question. The critique implies that the details about the NCBA should be removed to improve the answer. This allows for a concrete improvement by omitting the irrelevant information about the NCBA, thus making the answer more focused on the USCA.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about reasons for supporting development of meat-mimicking food?

**Answer**: The text states that proponents of meat-mimicking food argue that it's more environmentally friendly than raising traditional livestock. The new research suggests that without dairy and meat consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by over 75% - an area equivalent to the US, China, European Union, and Australia combined - and still feed the world. Globally, traditional animal farming accounts for about 18% of all greenhouse emissions, uses 47,000 square miles of land annually, and exhausts 70% of the world's water. The text also states that plant-based meat is healthier than traditional meat.

**Critique**: The text does not say this. This should be omitted.

**Rationale**: The critique states that "The text does not say this. This should be omitted," but it does not specify which part of the answer is incorrect or should be omitted.

What does the text say about public opinion of meat-mimicking food?

**Answer**: There is some concern among industry insiders and customers that meat-mimicking products, like plant-based and lab-grown meats, will cause confusion due to their labeling. This angst comes from the fact that meat products are made from slaughtered animals, which many people consider the definition of "meat". However, others see this food as healthier in that it's an easy source of protein without animal slaughter and lactose, which has harmful effects on the environment.

**Critique**: The text doesn't discuss the public opinion. There should be no answer.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the text does not discuss public opinion, implying that the current answer is irrelevant to the question. Therefore, the answer should be removed entirely. This is a clear directive that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by eliminating it, as it does not address the question asked.

What does the text say about the training of an opera singer in Britain?

**Answer**: The text says that Katie Bray is a mezzo-soprano noted for her baroque repertoire and that she studied at the Royal Academy of Music where she was taught by Elizabeth Ritchie and Iain Ledingham. Bray has been awarded many singing competitions and awards and is particularly known for her baroque repertoire.

**Critique**: It is important to note that Katie Bray went through a lot of education to succeed in her professional career. 

**Rationale**: The critique emphasizes the importance of Katie Bray's education in her success but does not provide specific details or additional information that would allow for a concrete improvement to the answer.

Summarize everything before 1960.

**Answer**: Nkala was elected chairman of the Bulawayo branch of the African Artisans' Union in 1950. He was elected president of the union in 1956. He served for some time as president of the African Trade Union Congress' Matabeleland region. He was also appointed Chairman of the Barbourfields Tenants' Association and member of the Bulawayo African Townships Advisory Board. In 1957, Nkala joined the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, led by Joshua Nkomo, and served as treasurer for the organization's Bulawayo branch until it was banned in 1959. He was a prominent figure in the African nationalist movement in Bulawayo, and was briefly detained after a state of emergency was declared by the colonial government in February 1959.

**Critique**: The answer omits Nkala's life before politics.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is missing information about Nkala's life before his political involvement. However, it does not provide any specific details or events from Nkala's life before his political career that could be added to the answer. Without access to the source material, it is impossible to know what aspects of his life before politics should be included.

Bearing this in mind, the narrator tries to help people and makes it a habit of going around doing these things because they believe it makes them feel better. He believes that it's every individual's responsibility to help others and also actively looks for ways in which he can be of assistance to others.

**Critique**: The first and last lines are not relevant to what the narrator thinks about himself.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the first and last lines of the answer are not relevant to the question about what the narrator thinks of himself.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about sleep paralysis in children?

**Answer**: At least one child, too young to sleep in his own bed, has been killed by a sleeping nightmare monster before life fades away. The child was killed despite the child not sleeping in a bed as the child would usually cling to his mother until she yells at him to go to bed, a behavior from the time when the child would still sleep in the same room as his parents. Sleep paralysis is the only safe thing no one ever gets used to, the narrator explains, so when it happens suddenly it's terrifying. A child is more likely to think their own parents are the monster when the child feels their life is in danger, the narrator says. The child's last words haunt the narrator to eternity.

**Critique**: Run on sentence

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the answer: it contains a run-on sentence. This feedback is constructive because it provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer. The editor can revise the answer by breaking down the run-on sentence into shorter, clearer sentences without needing to refer back to the source material. For example, the editor can separate the description of the child's behavior from the explanation of sleep paralysis and its effects.

The child was killed despite the child not sleeping in a bed as the child would usually cling to his mother until she yells at him to go to bed, a behavior from the time when the child would still sleep in the same room as his parents. Sleep paralysis is the only safe thing nobody ever gets used to, the narrator explains, so when if it happens suddenly it's terrifying. A child is more likely to think their own parents are the monster when the child feels their life is in danger, the narrator says. The child's last words haunt the narrator to eternity.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the level of opposition against the proposed Thrillopolis amusement park?

**Answer**: The proposed Thrillopolis amusement park was met with some opposition from the Nashville council members. Council member J.B. Loring was against the proposal because he thought it didn't fit in with the progress of Nashville. Council member Ron Nollner also showed opposition and said that the proposal was out of the question. Council member John Summers was also against the proposed Thrillopolis amusement park because he thought it was a risky investment and that the city shouldn't be the funding of first resort for a speculative business. Mayor Purcell also showed opposition to the park, saying that the city shouldn't take $127 million in public resources and put it to that use.

**Critique**: It should be mentioned that many people opposed the park's proposed location out of fear it would affect the city's skyline.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about an additional reason for opposition to the proposed Thrillopolis amusement park, namely concerns about its impact on the city's skyline. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding this specific detail about the opposition. The editor can enhance the answer by including this new piece of information without needing to refer back to the source material.

What does the text say about Themeparks LLC's pitch for Thrillopolis?

**Answer**: The CEO of Themeparks LLC, Evil Hart, pitched the concept for a Nashville-based amusement park called Thrillopolis to Mayor Bill Purcell and the Nashville Chamber of Commerce in April 2002. The company estimated that its construction would cost $193 million, and it wanted $127 million in public financing which it would back with a $100 million letter of credit. The park was to be built on an 82-acre industrial site. The park's location next to the Adelphia Coliseum and Downtown Nashville was opposed by many.

**Critique**: It should be mentioned that the vice president of Themeparks LLC pitched that they had to have a public-private partnership, as that is the model for how these parks work.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly added to the current answer.

**Critique**: The highlighted text doesn't answer the question and acts more like a summary. The response should reflect what the narrator thinks being a sidekick is and his warning towards the end about not ending up as one.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer does not address the question directly and instead provides a summary. It suggests that the answer should focus on the narrator's perspective on being a sidekick and include a warning mentioned towards the end. However, the critique does not provide specific details about what the narrator thinks about being a sidekick or what the warning is. Without this information, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the narrator's thoughts and the specific warning.

**Critique**: An incorrect assumption. Not all are strawberry flavored

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement "They are strawberry flavored" is an incorrect assumption because not all vaporizers are strawberry flavored. This implies that the answer should be revised to either remove the specific mention of strawberry flavor or to clarify that vaporizers can come in various flavors. Therefore, I can improve the answer by making it more accurate regarding the flavor aspect without needing to refer back to the source material.

The text implies that the protagonist believes that vaporizers could be a helpful tool to make this happen.

**Critique**: The last two sentences are unnecessary. There is no evidence in the text that the narrator believes that the vaporizer will help him transcend their body.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the last two sentences of the answer are unnecessary and provides a reason for their removal by stating that there is no evidence in the text to support the claim about the vaporizer helping the protagonist transcend their body.

The sunset and distorted weather seen during the subject's arrival at their destination, 'Sterling Cliff' encourages a stream of thoughts about the current state of the subject's mental health. The clouds parting to reveal a sky bespeckled with stars and a lone crescent moon is a rare and spectacular sight, representing all the things the subject perceives as special about themselves, like chasing the moon as a young child and having interest in the stars and nature. Realizing that their ability to see stunning natural sights is due to the bright moonlight only serving to keep them awake is a reflection on how healing has not come to the subject, who still feels that they should run away from their troubles and escape into the night sky.

**Critique**: This doesn't directly answer the question. This should state that Trump finds Kaepernick and other player's protests disrespectful. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should specifically mention that Trump finds Kaepernick's protests disrespectful. This implies a more direct statement about Trump's view on Kaepernick's actions. However, the critique does not provide enough information to fully address the question of summarizing the arguments against Kaepernick, as it only focuses on Trump's perspective and does not mention other potential arguments or perspectives.

**Answer**: The author states that go alongside shifts in sociological sexual measures are shifts in Dark Triad traits, particularly psychopathy. Results have been equated to di erences seen between men and women in Dark Triad traits and interest in casual sex. The study also found that bisexual women tend to score higher on measures of psychopathy than strictly heterosexual and lesbian women.

**Critique**: The first part of the response is incoherent and doesn't reflect what is in the passage. The phrase "The author states that go alongside shifts in sociological sexual measures" makes no sense. The second sentence also has a typo where the word "di erences" ought to be rewritten.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific feedback on the issues with the current answer. It points out that the first part of the response is incoherent and highlights a specific typo in the second sentence. This allows for concrete improvements: rewriting the first part to make it coherent and correcting the typo "di erences" to "differences."

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize what the article has to say about Dark Triad personality traits. 

**Answer**: The studies point to narcissism and extraversion as traits of the Dark Triad that correlate with higher sociosexual behavior.

**Critique**: The article did not state extraversion as a Dark Triad trait or that it correlates with higher sociosexual behavior.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer incorrectly identifies extraversion as a Dark Triad trait and incorrectly states its correlation with higher sociosexual behavior. However, the critique does not provide the correct information about what the article actually says regarding the Dark Triad traits. Without knowing what the article states, I cannot improve the answer to accurately reflect the article's content. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to know what to write.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the article say about sociosexuality?

**Answer**: The study found that bisexual women tended to score higher on measures of sociosexuality and psychopathy than strictly heterosexual and lesbian women. The study utilized the Kinsey scale of sexual attraction, which ranges from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual. In the very middle of the scale are individuals who are mostly heterosexual, equally heterosexual and homosexual, and mostly homosexual. The big-picture take away from the study is that sociosexuality shares a curvilinear (inverted-U) relationship with female sexual orientation.

### Sample 1623/1728 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about the difference in the competence of peer reviewers?


**Answer**: The text states that there is a "sweet spot" where the average peer review competency must be greater than a certain threshold to ensure high quality content. The text also states that the Peer Review System will more intelligently match peer reviewers in order to ensure that they collectively have a higher average peer review competency. Therefore, the text says that peer reviewers need to be more competent in order to create better quality content.

**Critique**: In this response, it is important to note that not all writers and peer reviewers are equally competent. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the response should acknowledge the variability in competence among writers and peer reviewers. However, it does not provide specific information on how to incorporate this into the answer. Without additional details or guidance on how to address the variability in competence, I cannot concretely improve the answer. The critique highlights a missing element but does not provide enough information to make a specific change or addition to the answer.

**Critique**: This response includes extra information that is not critical to development releases. Much of this response needs to be omitted and re-written. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer contains extraneous information that is not relevant to the development releases. However, it does not specify which parts of the answer are unnecessary or what the correct focus should be.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about Sharon's character, stating that she appears flirtatious in her text messages with Mike. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by including this detail about her character. The critique implies that while her character is not explicitly described, there is an observable trait (flirtatiousness) that can be mentioned.

**Critique**: Remove "presumably men sent by the husband" as there is not enough evidence for this.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance to remove the phrase "presumably men sent by the husband" due to a lack of evidence. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by eliminating the speculative part, making the answer more accurate and focused.

**Critique**: The baby doesn't go missing and remain unharmed, he and the narrator are both kidnapped. Remove everything after "and when the baby goes missing".

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what is incorrect in the answer and what should be removed. It states that the baby does not go missing and remain unharmed, but rather, both the baby and the narrator are kidnapped. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the incorrect information after "and when the baby goes missing" and potentially replacing it with the correct information about the kidnapping, if desired.

### Sample 1639/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize how the author got to this point of self-loathing with themselves. 

**Answer**: This story is a series of arguments and criticisms from each person towards the other. It seems they are in a relationship that they don't want to be in. One person criticizes the other for their lack of doing anything with their life and their reasons for doing so. Eventually, they both criticize each other for why they are in their relationship and living the way they do. The two also argue about each other's appearance.

**Critique**: The highlighted portion misconstrues the main concept of the passage, which is the internal dialogue of the narrator arguing with themselves. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the main concept of the passage is the internal dialogue of the narrator arguing with themselves, rather than arguments between two people. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by shifting the focus from an external argument between two people to an internal conflict within the narrator. The editor can revise the answer to reflect this internal dialogue without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1640/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the point of this story, if there is one.

**Answer**: The point of this story would seem to be that the narrator is expressing their feelings of anger and resentment at their partner, and the fact that they clearly feel drained from dealing with the other person.

**Critique**: The response is misconstruing the core concept of the story, which is the presentation of the internal dialogue of the author as an argument between two people. Furthermore, there is no resolution to the story, which one can be use to extrapolate to the fact that the passage does not present a central thesis. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer is incorrect by stating that it misconstrues the core concept of the story. It provides an alternative interpretation, suggesting that the story is about the internal dialogue of the author presented as an argument between two people, and that there is no resolution or central thesis. This information allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by focusing on the internal dialogue aspect and the lack of resolution, rather than feelings of anger and resentment.

The narrator explains that the cards represent opportunities in life. Pete draws again and gets the lowest number. He says he should have stuck with the second card. The narrator explains that people with big dreams are unable to appreciate what they have. Pete draws again and gets the lowest number again. The narrator tells Pete to enjoy the rest of his time at the fair and to remember the lesson he has learned. Pete turns over the card and it is blank. The narrator says he hopes Pete takes away a valuable lesson. Pete turns over the card and it has the number 76 written on it.

**Critique**: This could be worded in a more succinct way.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer could be more concise but does not provide specific guidance on how to achieve this. Without specific instructions or examples of what to remove or rephrase, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to determine which parts are essential and which can be omitted.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the plot twist in the story.

**Answer**: The story is told as a game being played with Pete, who makes the same mistakes that most people make when they are drawn to good opportunities and then fail to appreciate them. Evidence that Pete is playing the part of past whom are failing to appreciate the opportunities in life comes at the end when Pete has the fourth card with a blank underside. Without knowing it, Pete turned a card over so it was facing down. He then put the fifth card down, which turned out to be a card with a number engraved on the underside. The fifth card, which turned out to be a golden opportunity, ended up being a card made specifically for Pete, which meant that the card Pete held was of the kind that he had the ability to appreciate fully.

**Critique**: This is very confusingly written and seems to be inaccurate. The entire answer should be rewritten.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is confusingly written and seems inaccurate, but it does not provide specific guidance on what is incorrect or how to improve it. Without details on what the plot twist actually is or how the current answer is inaccurate, I cannot rewrite the answer effectively. I would need to refer back to the source material to understand the plot twist and correct the inaccuracies.

Pete's card has the number 76 written on it.

**Critique**: Only Pete draws a card.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that only Pete draws a card, which implies that the part of the answer stating "they both draw cards from a deck" is incorrect. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing or correcting the part about the narrator drawing a card.

Explain how the card turned from blank to displaying the numbers "76".

**Answer**: The card wasn't blank at first.

**Critique**: It would be better to say that it's not stated.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests changing the statement "The card wasn't blank at first" to "It's not stated" whether the card was blank at first. This implies that the original answer makes an assumption that isn't supported by the information available. The critique provides a clear direction to modify the answer to reflect uncertainty rather than a definitive statement.

### Sample 1668/1728 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe the turning point in the story.

**Answer**: The turning point in the story is when the narrator finds a scrap of metal. This is the first time the narrator has found something that is not a Sunspider. The narrator is overwhelmed with emotion and falls. The Sunspiders are focusing the light and the sun, like a giant lens, and the narrator knows they are part of me from all the times I've taken care of them. The narrator realizes that the Sunspiders are finishing things and taking care of the narrator. The narrator knows they are becoming dust in the wind and will keep travelling the world.

**Critique**: The events after the narrator's fall are irrelevant to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the events following the narrator's fall are irrelevant to the question about the turning point in the story. This implies that the answer should focus only on the events up to and including the narrator's fall. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the parts of the answer that describe events after the fall, specifically the parts about the Sunspiders focusing the light, the narrator's realization about the Sunspiders, and the narrator's thoughts about becoming dust in the wind.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Kirkland's professional career?

**Answer**: Kirkland was a French professional golfer who won twice on the Ladies European Tour and the 2013 Fourqueux Ladies Open on the LET Access Series.

**Critique**: Poor grammar. Without a colon, the response incorrectly implies that Kirkland won the Ladies European Tour two times.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a grammatical issue that affects the clarity of the answer. It implies that the sentence structure should be adjusted to correctly convey that Kirkland won twice on the Ladies European Tour and also won the 2013 Fourqueux Ladies Open on the LET Access Series. This can be improved by restructuring the sentence to separate the achievements clearly, such as: "Kirkland was a French professional golfer who won twice on the Ladies European Tour. She also won the 2013 Fourqueux Ladies Open on the LET Access Series." This correction can be made without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides enough information to understand the grammatical issue and how to fix it.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What does the text say about Kirkland's professional career?

**Answer**: Kirkland was french. She became a professional golfer in 2006. She won the 2012 Sanya Ladies Open in China on the Ladies European Tour and the 2013 Fourqueux Ladies Open near Paris on the Ladies European Tour. She died in 2017 at the age of 32, following a two-year fight against cancer.

**Critique**: The response includes extraneous information (she died in 2017) that is not useful for the task that explains her professional career.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the information about Kirkland's death in 2017 is extraneous to the question about her professional career. This implies that the answer should focus solely on her professional achievements and not include details about her death. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the sentence about her death, focusing only on her career milestones.

Summarize the type of relationship Will has with his wife.

**Answer**: After fifteen years of marriage, Will and his wife have a rather unpleasant relationship. Ever since his wife would show up at daybreak in a very fit of temper, his wife has changed for the worse. Will's wife has become a wreck and she certainly lost her good looks over the years, which Will notices. Will is usually quite mild tempered, but the last year clearly changed him. He was never violent and remains a very level headed man, however, he did walk away from his wife and two children. Will thinks it's her fault that he did so and would've preferred to be cleaning the lamp he had managed to break.

**Critique**: The hihglighted sentence is unnecessary.

**Rationale**: The critique states that a specific sentence is unnecessary, but it does not specify which sentence is highlighted. Without knowing which sentence is being referred to, it is impossible to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

What does the story say about the narrator's thoughts on their King?

**Answer**: The narrator is curious about the King because he is different than everyone else. He is always active and leaves the kingdom to go into the mines. He also has a lot of dogs that are not from the village. The narrator is sick of wondering and finally gets into the castle. He asks the King why he is different and the King tells him a story. The King explains that he was a player and that players are kings. The narrator believes him and accepts the fact that there is a better life to be had out of this one.

**Critique**: It is irrelevant that the narrator gets into the castle, asks the King why he is different and the King tells him a story, and that King explains that he was a player and that players are kings. The narrator believes him and accepts the fact that there is a better life to be had out of this one.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies which parts of the answer are irrelevant, allowing for a concrete improvement by removing those specific details.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the author's feelings on the person they are addressing in this piece. 

**Answer**: The author dislikes the morning, and finds mornings to be the worst part of their day because morning means spending more time with their morning. The author finds themself to be "filth," "a pathetic excuse for a man," and "a piece of shit." The author often describes the person they address as displeasing, disgusting, loose and disgusting.

**Critique**: The protagonist finds the mornings to be the worst part of the day because they have the rest of the day before them to spend time with the other person they dislike so much. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides additional context about why the protagonist dislikes the mornings, specifically linking it to the prospect of spending the rest of the day with the person they dislike. This information allows for a more nuanced understanding of the author's feelings towards the person they are addressing. The critique implies that the dislike for mornings is not just about the time of day but is tied to the presence of the other person.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the plot of the story.

**Answer**: Michael is sitting in a waiting room, thinking about his marriage to Irene. He thinks about how he met Irene and how they got married. He thinks about how he bought her a wedding ring, and how he feels that he has been betrayed by her. He thinks about how he has been betrayed by Bill, the man who took Irene from him. He thinks about how he has been betrayed by his father, Bill, and how he has been betrayed by his life. He pulls out a gun and shoots himself in the head. He also kills the doctor.

**Critique**: The response inaccurately mentions that Michael was betrayed by Bill and that Bill was his father, however he was betrayed by his wife. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about inaccuracies in the answer. It clarifies that Michael was not betrayed by Bill, nor was Bill his father, but rather that Michael was betrayed by his wife. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting these specific details. The editor can revise the answer to accurately reflect that Michael feels betrayed by his wife, without needing to refer back to the source material.
