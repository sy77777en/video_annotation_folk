{"question": "Answer the following question based on the above passage:\n\nSummarise what significant incident occurred at work while Hunter skeptically assumed his night duty.", "answer": "Hunter was on his way to another graveyard shift of monitoring the Distant Detection Array. He expressed his disinterest for his assignment to the attending officer as he always does. He thinks his job is a waste of time and resources. He is dressed in full uniform, has to have a special security clearance and works in a secret area of a heavily guarded military facility. He was prepared for another uneventful night of watching nothing happen on the monitors.\n\nAt 1:07 pm, some of the sensors started to detect something in a pocket of seemingly empty space about 17 light years away. One sensor detects an emission of gamma rays, another one detected x rays. This caught Hunter's attention as it is unusual for an area of empty space to emit such radiation. Hunter decided to take a look at the area with telescopes. He sent instructions an an infrared, visible light, and a radio telescope to survey the area. He was perplexed that both of them showed absolutely nothing even though the radiation levels were reaching levels that were theorized to be the upper limit of what the most powerful stars could emit. Because the telescopes couldn't see anything, Hunter was looking at data that told him a massive amount of radiation was either appearing out of nothing, or leaking into our universe. Hunter decoded that he would restart the sensors and receiving satellites to try and make sure these weren't false readings.\n\nAs he was waiting for the sensors to come back on, the infrared telescope he pointed at the area gave an alert. It had detected a momentary spike and drop to normal of heat in the area, which did not match the ever increasing readings from the other sensors. Hunter hoped the sensors would come back on, show nothing, and he could submit a simple sensor anomaly report to his superiors. These hopes were crushed when the sensors started returning information again. Not only did they pick up the radiation again, they were maxed out. Hunter couldn't believe it. He stared in awe, unable to come up with any explanation for what was going on in front of his eyes. Moments later, all the telescopes started giving alerts. The visible light telescope detected light levels akin to a supernova 100 light years away. The radio telescope was showing what could best be described as trying to broadcast every radio station from one antenna. The infrared telescope was telling him that this area of space, empty a few minutes ago, was engulfed in flames.\n\nThen it all stopped. Everything observing the anomaly stopped transmitting data. Hunter thought it was an issue with the receiving satellites, however a check revealed they were functioning properly. He tried restarting the sensors and telescopes, but simply could not get any data from them. Hunter decided this was unusual enough to report to the officers and senior scientists at the base.\n\nHe called an emergency meeting, having to wake up generals, astronomers, and physicists in the middle of the night. He thought that his news wouldn't be well received at such a time, however his training told him to go through with the protocol right away. After everyone had been assembled and lots of coffee had been consumed, hunter began to present the data and his recollection of the events. He was surprised as the others began to look horrified.\n\nOne of the generals pointed at Hunter and said \"Just to be clear son, you can never tell anyone outside this room what you just told us\". He then excused hunter from his post, and told him that he would file his honorable discharge papers immediately if Hunter wished to leave the force. \"Did I just detect something from out of this world?\" Hunter asked the general, to which one of the physicists replied in a solemn tone \"Out of this universe\".", "critique": "This is a copy of a large chunk of the story.

He was on his way to his post and expressed his disinterest at being assigned the task. His only responsibility is to report unusual feedback from telescopes and sensors, if anything unusual ever comes through. Hunter is convinced that the Array is being used to look for signs of an incoming attack from an extraterrestrial race and not to monitor supernova candidate stars, which is what the public is told.\n\nHunter started his duty at 11 PM and at 1:07 AM, some sensors at the Array started detecting something in a pocket of seemingly empty space about 17 light years away. One sensor detected an emission of gamma rays, another one detected x rays, which was unusual because an area of empty space is not supposed to emit such radiation. So Hunter decided to take a look with telescopes. He sent instructions to an infrared, visible light, and a radio telescope to survey the area. He was perplexed that both of them showed absolutely nothing even though the radiation levels were reaching the upper limit of what the most powerful stars could emit.\n\nHunter restarted the sensors and receiving satellites to try to make sure these weren't false readings. As he was waiting for the sensors to come back on, the infrared telescope he pointed at the area gave an alert.
