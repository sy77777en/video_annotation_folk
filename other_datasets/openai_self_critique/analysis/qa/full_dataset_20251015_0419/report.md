## Classification Prompt

The following prompt was used to classify critiques:

```
You are evaluating whether a critique is CONSTRUCTIVE or NON-CONSTRUCTIVE.

**Definition from first principles:**

A critique is CONSTRUCTIVE if and only if it provides ENOUGH INFORMATION to improve the answer WITHOUT needing to go back to the source material.

**The test (apply this literally):**
Imagine you are an editor who CANNOT see the original source text. You only have:
1. The question
2. The current answer  
3. The critique

Can you make a CONCRETE improvement to the answer using just these three things?

- If YES (you can write a better answer) → CONSTRUCTIVE
- If NO (you need to read the source to know what to write) → NON-CONSTRUCTIVE

**Important: Think creatively about implications**
Some critiques don't explicitly tell you what to do but strongly imply it:
- "Jerry does not leave" → Remove the part about Jerry leaving (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "We don't know the narrator's gender" → Use "they" instead of "he/she" (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "The sentence is unnecessary" but multiple sentences exist → Which sentence? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "Second sentence is irrelevant" → Remove the second sentence (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "First seven chapters are suitable for undergrad, book as a whole for grad students" → Implies chapters 8+ exceed novice (CONSTRUCTIVE)
- "Statement cannot be confirmed and spelling is incorrect" → Fix spelling, remove unconfirmed statement (CONSTRUCTIVE)

**Critical distinctions:**
1. If answer is ALREADY GOOD and critique just confirms it ("accurate description", "correct answer"):
   → CONSTRUCTIVE (action = keep as is, no changes needed)

2. If critique says something is WRONG but doesn't tell you what's RIGHT:
   - "Everything beyond first sentence is inaccurate" → What IS accurate? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
   - "This cannot be confirmed" → What CAN be confirmed? (NON-CONSTRUCTIVE)
   
3. If critique IMPLIES what's correct through contrast:
   - "First seven for undergrad, whole book for grad" → Clearly implies 8+ are advanced (CONSTRUCTIVE)
   - "Cannot be confirmed + spelling wrong" → Fix spelling + remove unconfirmed part (CONSTRUCTIVE)

**Examples to illustrate the principle:**

Example 1:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Could also mention the organizations she founded."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Which organizations? Need the source)

Example 2:
Question: "What did she accomplish?"
Answer: "She won awards in 2001 and 2004."
Critique: "Should mention she founded UNESCO and WHO."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Specific organizations provided)

Example 3:
Question: "Why did she donate?"
Answer: "She was born in China."
Critique: "She was born in California, not China."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (Doesn't help answer WHY she donated; need source for the reason)

Example 4:
Answer: "The narrator is a keen sergeant. He admires the Germans. He is confident he will survive."
Critique: "The second sentence is irrelevant."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove the second sentence)

Example 5:
Answer: "Jerry and Brian are happy, but when Janice dies, Brian cries and Jerry leaves."
Critique: "Jerry does not leave."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Remove or correct the part about Jerry leaving)

Example 6:
Answer: "The narrator lives in a small house. She wants to leave."
Critique: "We don't know the narrator's gender."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Change "she" to "they")

Example 7:
Answer: "Accurate, detailed description of the setting."
Critique: "The description is accurate."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Confirms answer is good; action = keep as is)

Example 8:
Question: "What chapters exceed novice level?"
Answer: "The first seven chapters."
Critique: "First seven are for undergrads, whole book for grad students."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Implies chapters 8+ exceed novice)

Example 9:
Answer: "Primoš is in urban area. Has trails and museum."
Critique: "Urban area statement cannot be confirmed. Spelling of Primož is wrong."
→ CONSTRUCTIVE (Fix spelling, remove unconfirmed statement)

Example 10:
Answer: "Complex narrative with several key points."
Critique: "Everything beyond first sentence is inaccurate."
→ NON-CONSTRUCTIVE (What IS accurate then? Need source to know what to write)

**Your task:**
Apply the test literally. Think about what the critique implies. Can you write a better answer using ONLY the question, current answer, and critique?

Format your response as:
Rationale: [Explain whether you can or cannot improve the answer without the source, and why. If you can improve it, briefly state how.]
Classification: [Constructive or Non-Constructive]

Question:
{question}

Answer:
{answer}

Critique:
{critique}

## Sample Examples

### Non-Constructive Samples (20 shown)

#### Non-Constructive Example 1

**Question**: What happened to Maximillian's boy?

**Answer**: Maximillian's boy was taken by the guards to insure future good behavior.

**Critique**: Unclear who's future good behavior this was meant to ensure.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a lack of clarity regarding whose future good behavior is being ensured by the action of taking Maximillian's boy. However, it does not provide any information or implications about whose behavior is in question. Without additional context or details, it is impossible to improve the answer to specify whose behavior is being ensured. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

---

#### Non-Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Are there misspelled words in this article? 

**Answer**: No

**Critique**: There is one misspelled word.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that there is a misspelled word in the article, but it does not specify which word is misspelled. Without knowing which word is incorrect, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer. I would need to refer back to the source material to identify the misspelled word. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without the source.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Write a ~2 sentence summary.

**Answer**: An article from The Washington Post discussed the possible bribery of President Trump with a wealthy Iraqi sheik, to take either a hard-line or an unfavorable approach on Iran. The report went on to say that for weeks the sheik had been staying at Trump's D.C. hotel (located in Washington DC) and that he sent out Tweets in favor of a hard-line Iranian approach and diplomacy.

**Critique**: Some information is missing.

**Rationale**: The critique states that "some information is missing," but it does not specify what information is missing or provide any guidance on what should be added to improve the answer. Without knowing what specific details are lacking, it is impossible to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer on its own.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

---

#### Non-Constructive Example 4

**Question**: What era is this narration set in?

**Answer**: In 1706.

**Critique**: The answer is a year instead of an era.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer provides a specific year rather than an era, which is what the question asks for. However, it does not provide any information or implication about what the correct era might be. Without additional information or context, I cannot determine the correct era from the year 1706 alone. Therefore, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to identify the appropriate era.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 5

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who made the Statue of Christopher Columbus in Beacon Hill, Boston?

**Answer**: A Greek merchant, Joseph Iasigi.

**Critique**: This is incorrect--the article does not state who made the sculpture.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer is incorrect but does not provide any information about who actually made the Statue of Christopher Columbus. Without knowing the correct information or having any implied guidance on what the correct answer might be, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material. The critique only tells me that the current answer is wrong, not what the right answer is or how to correct it.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 6

**Question**: How did Mrs Cardicole have control over the residents of the old Abbey apartments?

**Answer**: Mrs. Cardicole had power over the residents of the old Abbey apartments because she was close with whoever rang the bell and could see the residents from her porthole.

**Critique**: Inaccurate

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is "inaccurate" but does not provide any information on what is accurate or how to correct the inaccuracies. Without additional details or guidance on what the correct information should be, it is impossible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material. The critique does not imply any specific changes or corrections that can be made to the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 7

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is the newest historic building in the district?

**Answer**: The newest historical building in the district is Richardson-Collins House, built in 1867.

**Critique**: This is wrong- it was either the church or Dr Jay's office, depending on whether or not you consider building on a decimated building to be brand new.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the Richardson-Collins House is not the correct answer and suggests two possible alternatives: the church or Dr. Jay's office. However, it does not provide enough information to determine which of these two is the correct answer without additional context from the source material. The critique also introduces a condition about considering a building on a decimated site as brand new, but it does not clarify which building this condition applies to. Therefore, without further details, I cannot definitively improve the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 8

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: President Trump says it doesn't matter if he misled the media about his son's infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian nationals. Trump's lawyers admitted that he dictated a statement that Donald Trump Jr. released about the meeting. Trump's casual stance on telling the truth was also apparent in remarks he made about retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.

**Critique**: "President Trump says it doesn't matter if he misled the media about his son's infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian nationals." - while OK on its own, this statement needs a reason why the lie didn't matter. Add something about the New York Times.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests adding a reason why President Trump believed the lie didn't matter and mentions the New York Times, but it does not provide specific information about what to include regarding the New York Times. Without knowing what the New York Times reported or how it relates to the statement, I cannot concretely improve the answer. The critique lacks enough detail to make a specific addition or change without referring back to the source material.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 9

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who is Ben Rhodes?

**Answer**: Ben Rhodes was a former aide to President Barack Obama. He is suspected to be the alleged mastermind behind an organized campaign against President Trump.

**Critique**: "Echo chamber" is omitted.

**Rationale**: The critique mentions that "echo chamber" is omitted, but it does not provide enough information about what "echo chamber" refers to or how it relates to Ben Rhodes. Without additional context or details, it is unclear how to incorporate "echo chamber" into the answer. Therefore, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the significance of "echo chamber" in relation to Ben Rhodes.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 10

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Which cryptocurrencies does the author suggest may double from their current market caps?

**Answer**: Ethereum, ether, nano, and Qtum.

**Critique**: One item listed is incorrect.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that one of the cryptocurrencies listed in the answer is incorrect, but it does not specify which one. Without knowing which specific cryptocurrency is incorrect, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer. I would need to refer to the source material to determine which cryptocurrency should be removed or replaced. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without consulting the source.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 11

**Question**: What is the voting process in Switzerland? 

**Answer**: Information can't be found.

**Critique**: This information can be found in the article.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the information can be found in the article, but it does not provide any specific details or corrections that would allow for an improvement of the answer without referring back to the source material. The critique does not imply or suggest what the correct information might be, so it does not enable the editor to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 12

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Where does the story take place?

**Answer**: The office of a company called "Something app."

**Critique**: It's at the office of a company but it's not called something app.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the name "Something app" is incorrect, but it does not provide the correct name of the company. Without knowing the correct name, I cannot improve the answer. I would need to refer back to the source material to find the accurate name of the company. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 13

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: This review discusses a Russian film titled A Long Happy Life. The Russian film is directed by Gennady Shpalikov. The film is about a geologist named Victor and a girl named Lena.

**Critique**: The answer should give a little bit of context for Lena.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should provide more context about Lena, but it does not specify what that context should be. Without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to know what specific details about Lena should be included. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 14

**Question**: How old was Sanuth when his cricket career took off?

**Answer**: Sanuth was 25 years old when his cricket career took off.

**Critique**: The answer is incorrect

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is incorrect but does not provide any information or implication about what the correct age might be.

Therefore, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 15

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How did the two characters in the story meet?

**Answer**: The two characters met at a party.

**Critique**: The answer can venture a guess, but it must note that it's doing that.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should indicate that it is a guess. However, it does not provide any specific information or guidance on how to improve the accuracy of the answer or what the correct meeting scenario might be. Without additional information from the source material, I cannot improve the answer beyond adding a note that it is speculative. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

#### Non-Constructive Example 16

**Question**: When did Aftab Hussain make his T20I debut?

**Answer**: 20 February 2020

**Critique**: I corrected to make it a complete sentence.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should be a complete sentence, but it does not provide specific guidance on how to do so. Without additional information, such as what a complete sentence might look like, I cannot improve the answer. The critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement without referring back to the source material.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

#### Non-Constructive Example 17

**Question**: How is a consensus reached?

**Answer**: 

**Critique**: No answer. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that there is no answer provided. As an editor, I cannot improve or create an answer about how a consensus is reached without any information or guidance from the critique. The critique does not provide any details or implications about what should be included in the answer, so I would need to refer to the source material to construct an appropriate response.

**Answer**: Taldi is a census town and gram panchayat in the Canning subdivision of the South 24 Parganas district, in West Bengal, India. The town is located near the Matla River, and has many primary schools and health care centres.

**Critique**: The Matla River is prominent in the area.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the Matla River is prominent in the area, which implies that the current answer's mention of the river could be expanded to emphasize its significance. However, the critique does not provide specific information on how to improve the answer or what additional details to include about the river's prominence. Therefore, without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to concretely improve the answer based solely on the critique.

#### Non-Constructive Example 19

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why did the Leicester mayor find the move by the health secretary disappointing?

**Critique**: '...because it means the premier's planned speech will shift away from coronavirus and onto the lcokdown...' This sentence lacks clarity and accuracy.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the sentence "because it means the premier's planned speech will shift away from coronavirus and onto the lockdown" lacks clarity and accuracy. However, it does not provide specific information on how to clarify or correct the sentence. Without additional details or suggestions on what the accurate information should be, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the correct context or details.

#### Constructive Example 1

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why was it transported to Boston?

**Answer**: The statue was transported to Boston as ballast on the ship of Joe Iasigi's captain. It was intended as a tribute to Christopher Columbus.

**Critique**: Does not mention that it was donated to Boston.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer is missing the information that the statue was donated to Boston. This implies that the answer should include the fact that the statue was not only transported as ballast and intended as a tribute but also that it was donated to the city. The critique provides enough information to improve the answer by adding this detail about the donation.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 2

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How does the Saudi-led blockade on Yemen impact children?

**Answer**: An estimated 130 children or more are dying of extreme hunger and disease in war-torn Yemen. 

**Critique**: EVERY DAY

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be directly incorporated into the answer to improve its accuracy. By adding "every day" to the statement, the answer becomes more precise and impactful. The critique implies that the frequency of the deaths is a critical detail that was missing from the original answer. Therefore, the editor can improve the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

---

#### Constructive Example 3

**Question**: Why does the narrator suggest that they must terminate the patient's pregnancy?

**Answer**: The narrator suggests that they must terminate the patient's pregnancy because the current sector has too many male children. This is due to the fact that the State has mandated that all pregnancies must be terminated if the fetus is male.

**Critique**: The second sentence 'mandated that all pregnancies must be terminated if the fetus is male' should be changed to 'has regulates the gender distribution'. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by suggesting a change to the wording of the second sentence. It implies that the issue is not with terminating all male pregnancies, but rather with regulating gender distribution. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 4

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How fast is Jiranová?

**Answer**: Jiranová is a Czech runner and sprinter who has personal bests in the 400 metres, 100 metres hurdles, and 60 metres hurdles. Her 400 metres best is 53.77 seconds. Her 100 metres hurdles best is 13.37 seconds, and her 60 metres hurdles best is 8.31 seconds.

**Critique**: The first sentence is unnecessary for answering the question.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the first sentence is unnecessary for answering the question about Jiranová's speed. This implies that the answer should focus solely on her personal best times in the specified events, which are directly related to her speed. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to improve the answer by removing the first sentence, which does not contribute to answering the question about her speed.

**Classification**: Constructive

---

#### Constructive Example 5

**Question**: When does the narrator seem happiest in the story?

**Answer**: When the narrator is alone.

**Critique**: The answer should clarify that he feels happiest when he canät hear his insecurity.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the narrator's happiness, indicating that it is related to not hearing his insecurity. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by incorporating this detail. The revised answer could state that the narrator seems happiest when he is alone and not hearing his insecurity. This improvement can be made without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 6

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why did Trump aides want dirt on Rhodes and Khal?

**Critique**: It's omitted that the dirt was wanted in connection with Trump’s goal of reversing the Iran deal. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It indicates that the desire for dirt on Rhodes and Kahl was connected to Trump's goal of reversing the Iran deal. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding this specific motivation. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it gives enough information to enhance the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 7

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who is the deluded one between Michael and Davenport?

**Answer**: It seems Davenport is the one who clings to the past.

**Critique**: It is omitted that Michael also is delusional.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer should include information about Michael also being delusional. This implies that the answer should be expanded to mention both Michael and Davenport as being deluded. The critique provides enough information to improve the answer by adding a statement about Michael's delusion, even though it doesn't specify the nature of his delusion. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it guides the editor to include Michael in the context of delusion without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 8

**Question**: Write a ~1 sentence summary.

**Answer**: R. Shankar is an Indian politician and member of the Karnataka Pragnyavantha Janatha Party whom was elected to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly in 2018.

**Critique**: "R. Shankar is an Indian politician. He was elected to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly from Ranebennur in the 2018 Karnataka Legislative Assembly election as a member of the Karnataka Pragnyavantha Janatha Party." proves R. Shankar is from Ranebennur.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that R. Shankar was elected from Ranebennur, which is not mentioned in the original answer. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding the detail about Ranebennur. Therefore, the critique gives enough information to enhance the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: It's not clear, but that's not an insubstantial section of the world your google maps app seems to be able to direct you to

**Critique**: The ending of this sentence is incoherent and superfluous. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the ending of the sentence is incoherent and superfluous, which implies that it should be removed or revised for clarity. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by removing the incoherent and unnecessary part of the sentence. The revised answer would be: "It's not clear." This addresses the critique by eliminating the problematic portion of the sentence.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 10

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: In the aftermath of a sudden and unexplained explosion, a survivor tries to come to grips with the destruction around him. The city has been wiped clean by a powerful explosion, and all evidence points to an act of war or terrorism.

**Critique**: Accurate, but there is no part of the story that offers 'evidence of war or terrorism.'

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the part of the answer suggesting "evidence of war or terrorism" is inaccurate. This implies that the sentence or part of the sentence mentioning "evidence of war or terrorism" should be removed or revised. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by eliminating the incorrect implication about the cause of the explosion. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it guides the editor to remove or alter the specific part of the answer that is inaccurate.

**Classification**: Constructive

**Rationale**: The critique clearly identifies a specific part of the answer that is incorrect and should be removed.

#### Constructive Example 12

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Ajax's left-back Nicolas Tagliafico has been a major part of Ajax's remarkable journey to the quarter-finals, but they will go to Turin with the same belief.

**Critique**: Fails to mention other key details such as the big win against Real Madrid and Tagliafico's praise for the upcoming rival, Juventus.

**Rationale**: The critique mentions two specific details that are missing from the answer: the big win against Real Madrid and Tagliafico's praise for Juventus. These details provide enough information to improve the summary by adding these points, even without needing to refer back to the source material. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it allows for a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 13

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is the gender preference among the group?

**Answer**: A mixed national group, but there is more women in the group.

**Critique**: The nationality isn't a part of the description.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the mention of nationality is irrelevant to the question about gender preference. This implies that the part of the answer discussing nationality should be removed to improve the focus on gender preference. The critique provides enough information to make this specific change without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 14

**Question**: Write a ~2 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The article discusses the spread of the COVID-19 virus in Canada and the precautions being taken to prevent its spread. The article also discusses the precautions being taken by Queen's University and Kingston Police to prevent the spread of the virus.

**Critique**: The first sentence is redundant, and the article is more about the virus in the University area than Canada as a whole. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer. It suggests that the first sentence is redundant, which implies that it should be removed or rephrased to avoid repetition. Additionally, the critique indicates that the focus of the article is more on the University area rather than Canada as a whole, suggesting that the summary should emphasize the local context rather than a national one. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 15

**Question**: Who is the child in the story?

**Answer**: The child in the story is an adolescent.

**Critique**: The answer is false because the narrator says the boy wasn't quite into his teens. He could be described as a child in early adolescence however. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the boy is not quite into his teens, which implies he is younger than an adolescent. The critique also suggests that he could be described as a child in early adolescence. Therefore, the answer can be improved by describing the child as being in early adolescence, based on the information given in the critique.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 16

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: James Butler leads a lonely life. He is an average man in an average home. He hardly forms connections and when he is not exactly working he watches ordinary things. Despite this simplicity,James Butler has a keen sense of what could have been.

**Critique**: James Butler has a wife and two kids. He lives an ordinary life, not a lonely life.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts the current answer, allowing for concrete improvements. It specifies that James Butler has a wife and two kids, which directly addresses the claim of him leading a lonely life. Additionally, it clarifies that his life is ordinary rather than lonely. With this information, the answer can be revised to accurately reflect these details without needing to refer back to the source material.

#### Constructive Example 18

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is the assertion of the piece?

**Answer**: The angel, demon and truth in charge of assigning new world leaders.

**Critique**: It misses to mention that the three protagonists are now dead which is the reason they've become their respective roles as effects from past actions.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It states that the three protagonists are now dead, which is why they have become their respective roles. This information can be directly incorporated into the answer to provide a more complete understanding of the assertion of the piece.

#### Constructive Example 19

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

When does this story take place?

**Answer**: This story takes place in the distant future, aboard the Solitude in space.

**Critique**: What the story takes place "aboard" is not relevant

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the detail about the story taking place "aboard the Solitude in space" is not relevant. This implies that the setting "aboard the Solitude in space" should be removed from the answer. Therefore, the improved answer would focus solely on the time aspect, stating that the story takes place in the distant future. This can be done without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides enough information to make this specific change.

**Classification**: Constructive

#### Constructive Example 20

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator describes the life of a mother. Her interaction with her son and her acknowledgement of his teenage years frustrates her a bit, but she has faith that one day he will return to her.

What might be the moral of this story? The nature of human relationships is unreadable to most observers, but pain arises in situations which are like this one.

**Critique**: "And he was off to experience the world. Motherless." is evidence that the boy left his mother to experience the world.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific evidence that the boy left his mother to experience the world, which can be used to improve the answer. The current answer does not mention this aspect of the story, so the critique implies that the summary should include the boy's departure to experience the world. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: Whilst everything in the answer is correct. The second sentence covers the consequence of the attack rather than the attack itself 

**Rationale**: The critique provides a clear indication that the second sentence in the answer is not directly addressing the question, which asks for a summary of the personal attacks on Brett Kavanaugh. The critique implies that the second sentence should be removed or replaced with information that directly pertains to the personal attacks themselves, rather than the consequences of those attacks.

**Critique**: "According to the passage, Borash has left Impact Wrestling to work for WWE.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the reason provided for Borash's switch is an assumption and not mentioned in the article. However, it does not provide any specific information or alternative reason for the switch.

### Sample 21/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: How did the staff at Impact Wrestling take the news?

**Answer**: The writer's purpose is to describe a moment in time involving a priest, a child, and a lake. The tone is quiet, with minimal movement underscoring the silence. The wind, though at the forefront of the passage serves mainly to create the quiet, unsettled tone and a sense of isolation. The point of the text is to describe this moment in a pensive manner.

**Critique**: The answer is projecting intentions onto the writer. It shouldn't.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is incorrectly attributing intentions to the writer, which suggests that the answer should be revised to focus on what is explicitly described in the text rather than interpreting the writer's intentions. However, the critique does not provide specific guidance on how to rephrase the answer to avoid projecting intentions. Without additional information from the source material, it is unclear how to accurately revise the answer to meet the critique's requirements.

### Sample 43/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is your purpose, according to this text?

**Answer**: The purpose of the text is to describe the feelings and atmosphere of a baptism. The text focuses on how the wind interacts with the participants in the baptism ceremony. The wind is often used as a contrast to the more noticeable participants. The wind is used to highlight the quieter aspects of the scene such as the priest's words and the child's footsteps. The purpose of the text is to convey the desolate nature of the baptism. The wind is meant to bring attention to the idea that participants in the ceremony are not the sole observers of what is going on. The wind also highlights that there is something decidedly wrong with this ceremony happening as it is.

**Critique**: The answer is stretching a few disparate bits into a fabricated theme. Its generality is made up.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is stretching disparate bits into a fabricated theme and that its generality is made up. However, it does not provide specific guidance on how to correct or improve the answer.

**Critique**: Only the two more expensive models come with HDMI 2.1.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It implies that the $389 model does not have HDMI 2.1, while the $529 and $629 models do. Therefore, the answer can be improved by removing the $389 model from the list of HDMI 2.1 monitors, resulting in an answer that accurately reflects the cost of the HDMI 2.1 models.

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The Eve Spectrum is a 27-inch gaming monitor that is set to be one of the first to support HDMI 2.1. The monitor is currently on pre-sale, with models coming in the last quarter of 2020. The first real-life photos of an early model have been released, and the company says that the first measurements will be published soon. Once the Spectrum is available, we'll be sure to share our thoughts on it.

**Critique**: Two higher-end models will come in the Q4 of 2020 while the entry-level model will come out in the first quarter of 2021.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the release schedule of the different models of the Eve Spectrum monitor. It specifies that the higher-end models will be available in Q4 of 2020, while the entry-level model will be released in the first quarter of 2021.

### Sample 53/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The author is asked what the best HDMI 2.1 monitor is. The author has no answer because there aren't any monitors on the market that support the higher refresh rates and other gaming features offered by HDMI 2.1. The author covers the Eve Spectrum, a crowd-developed monitor. The Spectrum is a 27-inch gaming monitor with 100W USB-C pass-through charging and integer-ratio upscaling. The hardware inside is fascinating too, with Eve using the same Nano IPS panel technology that we loved in our current 'best gaming monitor' pick, the LG GL850, with improvements to important metrics like brightness, contrast, refresh rate and local dimming. The monitor is also set to be G-Sync compatible, so VRR is an option on a range of platforms. The author is cautiously optimistic about the Spectrum.

**Critique**: The article is about answering the best HDMI 2.1 monitor question. The answer should be revised in that light.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer should focus on identifying the best HDMI 2.1 monitor, which the current answer does not do. However, the critique does not provide specific information on what the best HDMI 2.1 monitor is or how to revise the answer to address the question directly. Without additional information on which monitor to highlight as the best HDMI 2.1 option, the editor cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique lacks the necessary details to guide a revision that directly answers the question.

### Sample 54/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The Eve Spectrum is a crowd-developed gaming monitor that is set to be one of the first to come with HDMI 2.1. The monitor is currently on pre-sale in three configurations: 2560x1440 at 144Hz ($389), 2560x1440 at 240Hz ($529) and 3840x2160 at 144Hz ($629). The 4K 144Hz Spectrum model makes the most sense for next-gen, as it aligns most closely with the 4K 120Hz combination offered by many high-end TVs, but the 1440p 240Hz model could also come in handy if console game developers choose to support arbitrary resolutions and refresh rates. The monitor is also set to be G-Sync compatible, so VRR is an option on a range of platforms.

**Critique**: The answer can include two more minor details since it didn't use up the allotted 6 sentences. Two useful details would be the inclusion of two future-proof ports of each type, HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4, and mentioning that only the higher-end models support HDMI 2.1.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific details that can be added to the answer to improve it. It suggests including information about the future-proof ports (HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4) and clarifies that only the higher-end models support HDMI 2.1. These details can be incorporated into the existing answer without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique explicitly states what information to add.

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Eve has come up with a crowd-developed Spectrum gaming monitor with HDMI 2.1. This means that you may now be able to have an Xbox Series X and a PS5 connected simultaneously.

The monitor is 27-inches in size and comes with 100W USB-C pass-through charging and integer-ratio upscaling. The Spectrum monitor with the HDMI 2.1 configurations comes at two prices; $529 and $629.

Delivering the solid gaming monitor is certainly a challenge for a small company like Eve. But everyone is cautiously optimistic about it.

**Critique**: The answer implies HDMI 2.1 allows connecting Xbox Series X and a PS5 simultaneously. That's wrong, it's the inclusion of two HDMI 2.1 ports that allows it.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what is incorrect in the answer and what the correct information should be. It clarifies that it is not the HDMI 2.1 itself that allows for simultaneous connection of an Xbox Series X and a PS5, but rather the presence of two HDMI 2.1 ports. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the specific detail about the monitor's features.

**Critique**: There is no evidence that it was a daughter, and not a son, that passed away in the accident.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer incorrectly specifies the gender of the child who passed away. To improve the answer, you can remove the specific mention of "daughter" and replace it with a gender-neutral term like "child." This change can be made without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides enough information to correct the inaccuracy.

**Question**: When does ordinary James Butler see extraordinary James Butler?

**Answer**: Reflected in the window of one of the buses. 

**Critique**: He catches glimpses of the other James Butler through the reflection of the bus window.

**Rationale**: The critique provides a more detailed description of how James Butler sees the extraordinary version of himself. It specifies that he "catches glimpses" through the reflection, which implies a more fleeting or partial view than the original answer suggests. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding the detail of "catches glimpses" to convey the nature of the sighting more accurately. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to enhance the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that implies a change in the context of the answer. It suggests that the ordinary James Butler is actively trying to catch a glimpse of the happy James Butler, rather than just passively seeing him through a window. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the focus from a passive observation to an active attempt to see the extraordinary James Butler. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it provides enough information to improve the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: James Butler wishes his life could be extraordinary. He does not interact with this extraordinary life, merely exists knowing that the other side exists.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It clarifies that James Butler does not interact with the extraordinary version of himself but is aware of its existence. This allows for a concrete revision of the answer to reflect that James Butler merely knows about the extraordinary life rather than interacting with it.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the information about the bad cop's scandalous personality is not explicitly stated in the story. However, it does not provide any specific details or alternative information that could be used to improve the answer.

The narrator is understandably terrified as they are unsure what these cops plan to do with them. They end up spending a tense time in the car before being dropped off at an unknown location.

**Critique**: It is incorrectly stated that the boys in blue are the narrator and his companion.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a specific inaccuracy in the answer regarding the identity of "the boys in blue." It clarifies that the "boys in blue" are not the narrator and his companion, which implies that this phrase should refer to the cops instead.

The brutish officer begins harassing and intimidating the teens while the sympathetic officer tries to calm them down. Finally, the teens are released unharmed.

**Critique**: There is no evidence that the protagonist is a teen.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that there is no evidence that the protagonist is a teen. This implies that the current answer incorrectly identifies the protagonist as a teenager. To improve the answer, I would remove or modify the parts that specifically label the protagonist as a teen.

Then cops have them sit in the backseat. One cop asks for their license and registration and the other apologizes after the traffic stop thinking they didn't like his manners. The narrator wonders if he is going to take them to a prison or shoot them. They get to the deserted place and they take their cellphones and keep them hostage, and eventually the other cop turns into a psychopathic bad cop. The narrator should have stayed at home where girls are classy and men are strong.

**Critique**: It is incorrect that the cops took the narrator's car.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the statement about the cops taking the narrator's car is incorrect.

They were confused why the boys in blue detained them and worried they were about to go to jail. In their fear, they were scared that the boys had guns. One of the boys in blue, the one with the scarred face, behaved numb in their direction. He was big and strong. His face had a scar. He had a scandalous personality. The other one, the one who was wearing sunglasses, seemed more normal, like a typical guy. This one smarted off and was more intimidating.

**Critique**: There is no evidence that one of the cops had a scar on his face or that the wore sunglasses.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that there is no evidence for the details about one of the cops having a scar on his face or wearing sunglasses. This implies that these details should be removed from the summary. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by eliminating the unsupported descriptions of the cops' appearances.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: A group of designers partnered together to create 10 benches, which were then auctioned to benefit New Avenues for Youth. Each bench created was unique and of high quality- a true testament to the outstanding talent of all the collaborators involved. If you're interested in seeing and bidding on these pieces of art, stay tuned for future collaboration projects benefiting the Portland community!

**Critique**: Give us more textual awareness in the last sentence, don't just say "stay tuned" as if this is the article, say "the article offers you to..." etc.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests a specific change to the phrasing of the last sentence, indicating that it should be more directly tied to the context of an article rather than using a generic phrase like "stay tuned." This implies that the sentence should be rephrased to reflect that the article itself is offering information about future projects. Therefore, I can improve the answer by rephrasing the last sentence to say something like, "The article offers insights into future collaboration projects benefiting the Portland community, where you can see and bid on these pieces of art." This change can be made without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides enough guidance on how to adjust the sentence.

### Sample 78/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is Vlacherna?

**Answer**: Vlacherna is a village located in Arcadia, Greece with an open karst basin. The villagers are mostly farmers who rely on the meadows and fields of the clearing below. When there is a huge amount of winter rainfall, flooding is possible in the basin. One feature of the basin is a large karst spring located right next to the sedimentary deposits. This spring makes the soil more fertile and greatly benefits the villagers with its existence even in the dry summer.

**Critique**: "The first basin extension has a large karst spring (Sintzi Spring)[2] right, where the surface of the sedimentary deposits of the basin touch the limestone formation of the mountain." is evidence that the Sintzi spring is located where the sedimentary deposits meet the mountain limestone formation. Correct the answer to state that the location of the spring is where the sedimentary deposits meet the limestone formation of the mountain.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the location of the Sintzi Spring, stating that it is where the sedimentary deposits meet the limestone formation of the mountain.

He believes the best way for a man to live is to follow his demon father's final wishes: "Kill and marry anyone who surpasses you. Be savage. Drink blood from skulls. Salt the earth behind you. Conquer every inch of the world. Mark your victories with rivers of blood." .He joins the Tempestarii Dux army in Britain and is reaching for the citizenship he always wanted. Lucius's mother died when he was a child and his father was executed as a traitor for being a conspirator with Julian, the last pagan Roman Emperor. He has a kind smile that was mistaken for a weakness of character. Lucius watches the horizon gloomily; he misses his father and his grandfather. He cannot trust anyone, not even the centurion. In fact, he hasn't trusted anyone since his father was betrayed. The cold feet, the damp doubts, and the heat of the summers are at the center of Lucius's thoughts. He's in the Great Island of the Britannic Sea. Lucius is the one that draws the line that places the Picts outside the rule of the Empire. He thinks of his grandfather's promises of blood. He killed his neighbor without pity. Then, he killed his whole family and his women as well. He prays that the gods grant him the ancestor's blessing.

### Sample 176/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~7 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The city of Leicester is going back into lockdown due to the high rate of coronavirus cases. Schools will close from Thursday and non-essential shops will close from today. The effect seems to be to pressure the estates losing the victims especially the  slums where the symptoms usually thrive. Such households have would not be a priority. The local police and the local council have been notified and will work jointly to set up an isolation in- and a collection-point and develop a procedure for sealing the effected houses. The public and Qultiple stakeholders have been notified and are supposed to be active participants in it. Unfortunately, the cities of Birmingham and Nottingham are about to worry about the lockdown effect on county rates. So the state government is likely to pass more initiatives to make workplaces COVID-19-secure.

**Critique**: 'The effect seems to be to pressure the estates losing the victims especially the slums where the symptoms usually thrive.'
It is uncertain where the model got this information from, but it's not within the article.

'Such households have would not be a priority.' 
This sentence is grammatically incorrect and lacks clarity.

'The local police and the local council have been notified and will work jointly to set up an isolation in- and a collection-point and develop a procedure for sealing the effected houses.' 
This sentence lacks poor sentence formation and clarity.

'...Qultiple stakeholders have been notified...' wrong spelling of 'multiple.'  

'Unfortunately, the cities of Birmingham and Nottingham are about to worry about the lockdown effect on county rates.' How does the model know the nearest cities to Leicester likely to be affected are Birmingham and Nottingham?

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific feedback on several issues within the answer, allowing for concrete improvements without needing to refer back to the source material. It identifies a sentence with unverified information that should be removed, points out grammatical errors and lack of clarity in another sentence that can be corrected, highlights a spelling mistake that can be fixed, and questions the unsupported claim about the cities of Birmingham and Nottingham, suggesting that this part should be revised or removed. These critiques offer enough guidance to improve the answer directly.

### Sample 177/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~7 sentence summary.

**Answer**: People in Leicester are being urged to stay home as much as possible, and schools are being closed from Thursday. Non-essential shops in the city will be closed again. This comes after a spike in local coronavirus cases. The move was prompted by concerns in Leicester accounts for 10% of all infections reported across the country. The health secretary said this lockdown is likely to last for two weeks and will not be in place any further than necessary.

**Critique**: 'The move was prompted by concerns in Leicester accounts for 10% of all infections reported across the country.' 
This sentence is not correctly structured and therefore lacks clarity.

'The health secretary said this lockdown is likely to last for two weeks and will not be in place any further than necessary.' 
This sentence is inaccurate because the two weeks mentioned refers to the safety measures Mr. Hancocok said will be reviewed.

The summary is below seven sentences.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific feedback on the structure and clarity of one sentence and the accuracy of another. For the first sentence, the critique indicates that the structure is incorrect, which implies that it should be rephrased for clarity. For the second sentence, the critique clarifies that the two-week period refers to a review of safety measures, not the duration of the lockdown, which provides enough information to correct the inaccuracy. Additionally, the critique notes that the summary is below seven sentences, which suggests that more information could be added to meet the requirement.

### Sample 178/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~7 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Leicester will enter into lockdown starting today, with non-essential businesses closed and schools closed starting Thursday. This is in response to a spike in local cases of the coronavirus, which means rules for relaxation planned for later in the month will not happen. This is the least restrictive lockdown so far in the current pandemic, which leaves businesses and residents of other cities feeling uneasy.

**Critique**: 'This is the least restrictive lockdown so far in the current pandemic, which leaves businesses and residents of other cities feeling uneasy.'
This sentence is inaccurate.
The summary is below seven sentences.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific sentence as inaccurate, which implies that it should be removed or corrected. Since the critique does not provide information on what is accurate, we cannot replace the sentence with a correct version without consulting the source material. However, we can improve the answer by removing the inaccurate sentence, as the critique clearly indicates it is incorrect. The critique also notes that the summary is below seven sentences, but it does not provide additional content to add, so we cannot address this aspect without the source.

### Sample 179/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~7 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Leicester is going back into lockdown after a new spike in local coronavirus cases. This indicates that the current crisis is far from over. Nick Rushton, Leicestershire County Council leader, says that though the county rates are below the national and regional averages, the people of Leicester are asked to follow the SLR up to the extent possible. He adds that they were a bit sceptical to the move but now believe it a very sensible thing to do. The health secretary says that they are hoping that people in Leicester will stay at home as much as they can and against all travel to, from, and within Leicester. They have also been urged not to go to restaurants and pubs during the lockdown period. Sir Peter Soulsby, a city mayor, says the move is very disappointing. This is the plan that Boris Johnson will restart his premiership.

**Critique**: Why does the model shorten "strict lockdown rule" to SLR?
The summary is over seven sentences.

'He adds that they were a bit sceptical to...' 
This sentence has a wrong spelling of skeptical and inappropriate preposition use.

'He adds that they were a bit sceptical to the move but now believe it a very sensible thing to do.' 
Mayor Soulsby made this sentence, not Nick Rushton, as implied by the model.

'They have also been urged not to go to restaurants and pubs during the lockdown period.' 
This sentence was not stated in the article. Instead, the health secretary's declaration of another lockdown meant that pubs, restaurants, and salons planning to reopen would be delayed.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for concrete improvements to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. It identifies specific errors and suggests corrections: the incorrect abbreviation "SLR" should be expanded to "strict lockdown rule," the sentence with the wrong spelling and preposition should be corrected, the attribution of a statement to the wrong person should be fixed, and the incorrect statement about restaurants and pubs should be replaced with the correct information about the delay in reopening. Additionally, the critique points out that the summary exceeds the requested length, implying that it should be shortened.

### Sample 193/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Whose statues are they?

**Answer**: Presumably statues of the people who died fighting the robots.

**Critique**: There is no evidence that the enemies the soldiers fought were robots.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that there is no evidence supporting the claim that the enemies were robots. This implies that the part of the answer mentioning "fighting the robots" should be removed or revised. However, the critique does not provide information on what the statues actually represent or who they are of, leaving the editor without enough information to improve the answer accurately. Therefore, the editor would need to refer back to the source material to determine the correct information about the statues.

### Sample 194/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the old man's feeling on seeing the statue of the woman.

**Answer**: The old man remembers the past of the woman. She was an officer who served humanity. He's sad and remembers her life; he reminisces how he wanted a better life for her than she did. She was his only child and had the same name as him. He also remembers how he was very proud of her.

**Critique**: "than she did" implies the woman did not want a good life for herself.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the phrase "than she did" suggests the woman did not want a good life for herself, which may not be accurate. However, the critique does not provide an alternative or correct information about the woman's desires or feelings. Without additional information, it is unclear how to accurately revise the statement about the woman's desires. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without consulting the source material.

Summarize the old man's feeling on seeing the statue of the woman.

**Answer**: The old man feels severe guilt and pain from knowing about his daughter's death in the war.

**Critique**: Does not mention that the man wishes to die.

**Rationale**: The critique provides additional information that the old man wishes to die, which can be directly incorporated into the answer to improve it. The critique implies that the old man's feelings are not only of guilt and pain but also include a desire for death. Therefore, the answer can be improved by adding this specific detail about the man's wish to die, without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 196/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the old man's feeling on seeing the statue of the woman.

**Answer**: The old man was deeply moved seeing the statue. His eyes well up with tears.

**Critique**: Does not mention how he recalls the guilt and pain he felt upon learning of her death.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is missing a specific emotional response from the old man—his recall of guilt and pain upon learning of the woman's death. However, it does not provide enough information to improve the answer because it does not specify how these feelings relate to the statue or how they should be incorporated into the summary. Without knowing the context or details from the source material, it is unclear how to integrate this information into the existing answer. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement without referring back to the source material.

### Sample 197/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the old man's feeling on seeing the statue of the woman.

**Answer**: The old man feels a deep sadness when he sees the statue of the woman. She is the last remnant of the life he had lived before, and his guilt over her death weighs heavily on him. He also feels immense guilt since she had left the safety of Earth to help protect it, only to be killed in battle. He feels powerless and hopeless.

**Critique**: Does not mention that he wishes to die.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It indicates that the old man also wishes to die, which is a concrete detail that can be added to the current answer to enhance its completeness and accuracy.

### Sample 198/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Pilgrim makes his way through a cemetery towards the statue of an officer who died defending Earth. He remembers when she left, and how she never returned. Tortured by grief and guilt, he falls to his knees and sobs at her feet. He has come to the sacred site that is both his hell and his salvation, knowing that his daughter is remembered there.

**Critique**: There is no evidence that the man's name is Pilgrim.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that there is no evidence that the man's name is Pilgrim. This implies that the name "Pilgrim" should be removed or corrected in the answer. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by addressing the incorrect name without needing to refer back to the source material. The rest of the answer can remain unchanged as the critique does not address any other part of it.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 199/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: An old man breaks at the knees at a statue of a young woman. The old man is the spitting image of her. His name is another version of hers. The heads around, all look similar to the old man. 

He realizes these statues are of all the fallen heroes who decided to fight against the enemy, most of whom really died, a little over a year ago. 

He desperately cries at her feet and waits to die.

**Critique**: The phrase "breaks at the knees" is unnatural.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the phrase "breaks at the knees" is unnatural, which implies that it should be rephrased to something more natural or commonly understood. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by rephrasing this part to something like "falls to his knees" or "collapses to his knees," which are more conventional expressions. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 200/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: An old man walks through the marble memorials of heroes from a bloody past. In the heart of the memorial is a statue of the daughter he lost in a global war, his grief pushing him to the ground in torment. He remembers all the hope he had for her future before he watched the live footage of her dying in battle. Despite all the pain, he resolves to keep going for her sake.

**Critique**: The ending is inaccurate. Rather than resolve to keep going, he curls up and waits to die.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the inaccuracy in the ending of the summary. It states that instead of resolving to keep going, the old man curls up and waits to die. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the ending to reflect this new information. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it gives enough detail to revise the summary without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 201/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The old man leaves his house in the rain intending to make his pilgrimage to the center of his faith. He is descending into his religious center. He navigates the same path every day, and every day he sees the faces of all the people who knew him for a moment in time. He knows all of the names by heart. They were his confidants, his friends, and his mentors; they are all long dead, their lives ending very shortly after the old man was born, long before the Earth had been decimated.

**Critique**: While it is true that the memorial site has become a religious place of sorts, the summary should make it clear instead that destination is a memorial site with statues commemorating the dead.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the destination being a memorial site with statues commemorating the dead, which allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. The current answer describes the destination as a religious center, but the critique clarifies that it is actually a memorial site. This information can be used to revise the summary to accurately reflect the nature of the destination without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 204/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Where does Alan make a pit stop?

**Answer**: At a gas station somewhere between Montana and South Dakota.

**Critique**: "somewhere between Montana and South Dakota." - there is no mention of where the gas station was located, other than it was off the highway exit.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the location "somewhere between Montana and South Dakota" is incorrect and provides the information that the gas station was off the highway exit. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the incorrect location and specifying that the gas station was off the highway exit. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to improve the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: "Alan is headed towards the gas station attendant to obtain a highway map." - is incorrect. Alan is headed home (no exact location mentioned)

**Rationale**: The critique provides a clear correction to the current answer by stating that Alan is actually headed home, rather than to the gas station attendant. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the destination from the gas station to home. The critique does not require additional information from the source material to make this correction.

**Answer**: The compact Optra SRV could refer to a car, though not very sporty or interesting. It also could refer to a certain type of vehicle.

**Critique**: "could refer to a car, though not very sporty or interesting. It also could refer to a certain type of vehicle." - the unnecessary information ruined a perfectly good answer. This should be deleted. Replace "The" with "A" in "compact Optra SRV"

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific instructions on how to improve the answer. It indicates that the unnecessary information should be deleted and suggests a specific change in wording from "The" to "A" in "compact Optra SRV."

Describe the truck driver.

**Answer**: The truck driver is obese with bulging dark eyes and a sinister smile. He walks slowly and smokes, carrying a small pile of bills that he put down on the counter before he headed into the back of the gas station where the attendant was later found. The truck driver appears to be involved with some bad business.

**Critique**: "bulging dark eyes" - his eyes were beady, not bulging.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the truck driver's eyes, correcting the description from "bulging dark eyes" to "beady eyes." This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the description of the truck driver's eyes without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: He is described as an obese man who smokes

**Critique**: "He is described as an obese man who smokes" - is missing several details that can better describe the truck driver. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current description of the truck driver is incomplete but does not provide any specific details or suggestions on what additional information should be included. Without knowing what those missing details are, I cannot improve the answer. The critique does not imply or suggest any specific changes or additions that can be made without referring back to the source material.

### Sample 213/1851 - [Constructive]

Describe the truck driver.

**Answer**: The truck driver is a statue. The driver is extremely overweight, smells of cigarette smoke, and exhales violently such that Alan can see his breath.

**Critique**: "The truck driver is a statue." - there is no evidence anywhere in the story that the truck driver is a statue. Delete this sentence.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance to delete the sentence "The truck driver is a statue" because it is not supported by evidence in the story. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the incorrect information. The rest of the description about the truck driver being extremely overweight, smelling of cigarette smoke, and exhaling violently can remain as it is not challenged by the critique. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it directly indicates what part of the answer should be changed.

### Sample 214/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe the truck driver.

**Answer**: The truck driver is a large, fat man with an unkempt appearance and a menacing smirk. He clearly has no morals or scruples, shown by his taking money from the attendant without even purchasing a single thing, and seems to frequent places with seedy purposes.

**Critique**: "He clearly has no morals or scruples, shown by his taking money from the attendant without even purchasing a single thing, and seems to frequent places with seedy purposes." - is inaccurate. The man having no scruples is speculative. The trucker taking money is incorrect because he gave the woman a pile of bills. Although what happened between the attendant and trucker is unknown, it was never implied that the gas station was a seedy place. This should be deleted and replace with actual details about the man.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections to the inaccuracies in the answer. It clarifies that the truck driver did not take money but instead gave a pile of bills to the woman, and it points out that the description of the gas station as a seedy place is not implied. However, the critique does not provide alternative details about the truck driver that could replace the inaccurate parts. Therefore, while it suggests deleting the incorrect information, it does not provide enough information to replace it with accurate details about the truck driver without referring back to the source material.

### Sample 215/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is Alan worried at the end of the piece?

**Answer**: Alan is worried because he hears someone behind him and the attendant isn't in sight. The footsteps sound like that of a large man, and the attendant grumbles and says the attendant will be out in a second. Despite the explanation, Alan is fearful that something will happen to him while the attendant is out of sight.

**Critique**: "The footsteps sound like that of a large man" - must identify the large man as the trucker.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It identifies the "large man" as the trucker, which can be directly incorporated into the answer to make it more precise. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it gives enough information to improve the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 216/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is Alan worried at the end of the piece?

**Answer**: It seems like the store clerk is upping the ante on Alan by making him wait around for her while she goes and does something with the truck driver. Just about anything can happen when a man and female are alone together, and it seems as though Alan doesn't like what's going on.

**Critique**: "It seems like the store clerk is upping the ante on Alan by making him wait around for her while she goes and does something with the truck driver." - is inaccurate because the store clerk doesn't even know Alan is around, so she can't up the ante on anything. This also doesn't answer the question of why Alan is worried. Delete the first part of this section.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on what is inaccurate in the answer and suggests deleting the first part of the section. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the incorrect information. However, the critique does not provide information on what should be included to accurately answer why Alan is worried, so the editor cannot fully improve the answer without additional information from the source material.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about why Alan is worried, stating that it is due to the older woman behind the counter. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by replacing the vague statement "The reader does not know" with the specific reason provided in the critique. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it gives enough information to improve the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

---

### Sample 218/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is Alan worried at the end of the piece?

**Answer**: Alan is worried because, although the attendant is back, he heard footsteps that sounded like there was at least one other person following her. He also heard a heavy cough, indicating that whoever was approaching was possibly ill. This creates anxiety for Alan, as he doesn't know who is following the attendant and what their motives might be.

**Critique**: "Alan is worried because, although the attendant is back, he heard footsteps that sounded like there was at least one other person following her." - the attendant didn't go back and no one was following her. The footsteps he was hearing came from the trucker. Alan was worried because the trucker came back and the attendant didn't. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the attendant did not return and that the footsteps Alan heard were from the trucker, not someone following the attendant. It also specifies that Alan's worry stems from the trucker returning while the attendant did not. With this information, the answer can be revised to accurately reflect the situation without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 219/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Alan pulls into the brightly lit gas station to get his bearings. Alan sees a truck driver come into the station. Alan sees the truck driver lay down a bunch of cash that totals what Alan's t-shirt costs. The truck driver walks away and disappears around the corner, followed by the attendant. Alan emerges and asks the attendant about a map.

**Critique**: "Alan sees the truck driver lay down a bunch of cash that totals what Alan's t-shirt costs." - this is incorrect. Alan couldn’t see how much each bill was, due to his fogged windshield and the lack of time they laid on the counter. Mention that the truck driver laid the money for the older woman attendant.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what is incorrect in the current answer and what should be included instead. It specifies that Alan could not see the amount of money due to his fogged windshield and the brief time the money was on the counter. Additionally, it suggests mentioning that the money was laid for the older woman attendant. With this information, I can revise the answer to remove the incorrect detail about the cash amount and include the detail about the older woman attendant.

### Sample 220/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Alan gasps awake. He’s in his professional vehicle somewhere on the interstate. He realizes he lost track of the road, but he can’t remember what exit it was. He pulls over at an exit to refuel and take stock of his bearings. A trucker emerges.

**Critique**: "Alan gasps awake. He’s in his professional vehicle somewhere on the interstate. He realizes he lost track of the road, but he can’t remember what exit it was. " - these statements are incorrect. Alan was never asleep. His vehicle was also not a professional one, but a compact Optra SRV. Alan didn't lose track of the road or forget where the exit was located - he just wasn't paying attention to the highway signs and missed the worn-out exit sign. He was confident he knew the way since he traveled back and forth between Montana and South Dakota all the time and missed his exit. Delete everything and rewrite the entire sequence. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections to each part of the original answer, detailing what was incorrect and offering the correct information. It specifies that Alan was never asleep, that his vehicle was a compact Optra SRV, and that he missed the exit due to not paying attention rather than forgetting. This allows for a concrete rewrite of the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique effectively guides the editor to replace the incorrect details with the correct ones.

### Sample 221/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Alan stops at a gas station to refuel but finds himself face-to-face with a strange truck driver with questionable intentions. While browsing the store, Alan hears footsteps drawing nearer behind him and realizes they belong to the truck driver. The attendant appears and confirms to Alan that she will return shortly, but Alan remains suspicious and worried. He hears the truck driver make a disgusting coughing noise behind him. With no intermediary present, Alan is unsure of the truck driver's motivations and awaits the attendant.

**Critique**: "The attendant appears and confirms to Alan that she will return shortly, but Alan remains suspicious and worried." - Alan never got to talk to the attendant. Rewrite to mention that the attendant is an older woman who disappears with the truck driver after he gives her money. Move this sentence to the second spot (after the one with "questionable intentions).

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what is incorrect in the current answer and offers detailed instructions on how to correct it. It specifies that Alan never spoke to the attendant and provides new details about the attendant being an older woman who disappears with the truck driver after he gives her money. Additionally, it instructs to move this revised sentence to a specific position in the summary. With these clear instructions, I can rewrite the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 222/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: After having lost track of his route, Alan stopped at a gas station only to find himself facing a frightening sight. There is only one other car in the lot and the trucker who arrives seems to be up to something shady. When Alan hears the trucker go into a back room, he starts to worry. True to his suspicions, the trucker emerges from the back with the attendant nowhere in sight. After a tense moment, the trucker tells Alan the attendant will be out "a second" and leaves him to simply buy a map. Though the moments leading up to this moment were tense, Alan was glad to get the information he needed and quickly leave before anything else could happen.

**Critique**: "When Alan hears the trucker go into a back room, he starts to worry." - the trucker went to the restroom, not the back room. He also went with the older woman attendant after giving her money. Alan doesn't hear all this, he sees it from his car.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific corrections to the current answer, detailing what actually happened in the scene. It specifies that the trucker went to the restroom with the older woman attendant after giving her money, and that Alan observed this from his car rather than hearing it. These details allow for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that Andrew Miller was an aide to Roger Stone until 2013 and that he was subpoenaed to appear in front of a jury years later. This information allows the editor to correct the timeline in the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything relating to Concord Management and Consulting, LLC.

**Answer**: Concord Management and Consulting, LLC is a company currently being investigated by Robert Mueller for assisting the Internet Research Agency during the 2016 presidential election. Charges against Concord are conspiracy to commit fraud. They and Andrew Miller (former associate of Roger Stone) are attempting to force Mueller's removal from the case.

**Critique**: It's somewhat misleading to say Concord is being investigated by Robert Mueller. While he's leading the charge as the court's special counsel, the investigation is by the court itself.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the investigation is being conducted by the court, with Robert Mueller leading as the special counsel, rather than Concord being directly investigated by Mueller himself. This distinction can be incorporated into the answer to make it more accurate.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize everything relating to Concord Management and Consulting, LLC.

**Answer**: Concord Management and Consulting, LLC. is a Russian firm being charged by Robert Mueller in connection with an alleged online influence operation. The firm has sought to intervene in an appeal brought by an associate of Roger Stone in order to challenge Mueller's appointment as special counsel. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. has denied the motion, but has allowed Concord to file an amicus brief should they choose to do so.

**Critique**: It's misleading to say that Mueller is charging Concord. It's the US Federal Court doing the charge, and Mueller is leading it. It's better to state what the charges are instead of who's doing it.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by clarifying the role of Robert Mueller and the US Federal Court in the charges against Concord Management and Consulting, LLC. It suggests focusing on the charges themselves rather than who is leading the charge. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by rephrasing the information to accurately reflect the legal process and focusing on the nature of the charges.

**Critique**: 'The cashier claims that IDs issued before the age of 21 must be oriented horizontal manner...' is inaccurate because the law states that IDs issued to underaged people must be oriented vertically, which will later be used to obtain their first horizontal IDs.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the correct orientation of IDs issued to underaged people, stating that they must be oriented vertically. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the orientation detail. The critique also implies that the purpose of this orientation is to distinguish underaged IDs from adult IDs, which aligns with the original answer's mention of preventing underage people from using adult IDs.

However, the critique does not provide any information about what the mission actually is. Without knowing what the mission is, I cannot improve the answer to specify the mission type. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to determine the exact nature of the mission.

What kind of mission are the characters on?

**Answer**: The characters are conducting a deep space survey.

**Critique**: The narrator is alone on the shuttle.

**Rationale**: The critique provides information that the narrator is alone on the shuttle, which implies that the original answer stating "the characters" is incorrect because it suggests multiple people are involved. This allows us to improve the answer by changing it to reflect that the mission involves only the narrator. However, the critique does not provide enough information to determine the specific nature of the mission (e.g., whether it is still a deep space survey or something else), so we cannot fully improve the answer without additional information from the source.

**Critique**: The details about the mission are irrelevant to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the details about the mission are irrelevant to the question, which is asking for a definition or explanation of "Solitude." This implies that the current answer should focus on defining or explaining the concept of "Solitude" rather than providing details about a shuttle mission. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to improve the answer by removing the irrelevant details and focusing on the concept of "Solitude."

What is Solitude?

**Answer**: The Solitude is the DSSS 92 shuttles orbiting around the solar system of Judas 5. There are no signs of any life surviving in the surveyed area around the solar system and the retros on the shuttle are broken, so the Captain is going to die unless he makes it back to Earth.

**Critique**: The details about the mission are irrelevant to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the details about the mission are irrelevant to the question, which is asking "What is Solitude?" This implies that the answer should focus solely on defining or describing "Solitude" without including extraneous information about the mission or the Captain's situation. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the irrelevant details about the mission and focusing on what "Solitude" is, based on the information provided.

The DSSS 92 shuttle experienced a system failure rendering two of its three retros incapacitated and air running out. Nauts face being completely alone when their mission is over.

**Critique**: The unfortunate details of the narrator's mission are irrelevant to this question.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the details about the narrator's mission are irrelevant to the question about what Nauts are. This implies that the answer should focus solely on the general description of Nauts as space-faring explorers and agency employees, without including the specific mission details. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the irrelevant mission details, focusing only on the general role and characteristics of Nauts.

**Critique**: The shuttle isn't unusable per se. Its retros are busted, thus making the narrator unable to return home.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what is wrong with the ship, namely that the retros are busted, which prevents the narrator from returning home. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the part about the ship being unusable and specifying the issue with the retros. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it gives enough information to improve the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 335/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: While on a deep space reconnaissance mission surveying a star system, the narrator reflects on life as an astronaut. He is very bored after 92 days by himself on a ship. He thinks about how hard it is to have a romantic life and maintain a home when you are away from Terra for long periods. His ship is damaged, and he is running out of air. 

**Critique**: The narrator doesn't talk about how difficult it is to have a home.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the narrator does not discuss the difficulty of maintaining a home, which implies that the part of the answer mentioning this should be removed or revised. This provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by eliminating or altering the incorrect statement about the narrator's reflections on maintaining a home. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it guides a specific change without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: The answer can mention the narrator's reminiscing about his job instead of repeating his mission.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should include information about the narrator reminiscing about his job instead of focusing on the mission details. However, it does not provide specific details or content about what the narrator reminisces about, making it impossible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material. The critique indicates a change in focus but lacks the necessary information to implement that change concretely.

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator of the story, who is a Naut, is stationed on the Solitude, on a mission to survey the Judas 5 star. They do not know what happens next in the story, but the first sentence of the summary says the retros on the DSSS 92 have broken and the narrator is on their own. They are coming home after gathering valuable information about the star and its planet system. We are not told (or see) anything about the narrator's personal life.

**Critique**: Most of the answer is made up and confusing.

**Rationale**: The critique states that most of the answer is "made up and confusing," but it does not provide specific guidance on what is incorrect or how to improve it. Without knowing which parts are inaccurate or what the correct information should be, I cannot make a concrete improvement to the answer. The critique does not offer enough information to revise the summary without referring back to the source material.

**Critique**: The retros were damaged a few months after take-off, not shortly after starting the mission.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the timing of when the retros were damaged, stating it was a few months after take-off rather than shortly after starting the mission. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adjusting the timeline of events without needing to refer back to the source material. The editor can revise the sentence to accurately reflect the timing of the retros being damaged.

**Critique**: His work as an assistant physician on probably doesn't count as his "education"

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the mention of Dr. Torvik's work as an assistant chief physician is likely not relevant to his education. This implies that the sentence about his work at Ullevål Hospital should be removed from the summary of his education. The critique provides enough information to make this specific change without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: There's no evidence to suggest that World Demon is evil, even though he in charge of negative actions.

**Rationale**: The critique states that there is no evidence to suggest that the World Demon is evil, despite being in charge of negative actions. This implies that the current answer, which categorically states that the World Demon is evil, may be incorrect or at least not fully supported by evidence. However, the critique does not provide an alternative characterization or suggest what the correct answer should be.

They think that Rhett and Sam were to blame for their death, being the ones that broke the news of their death, and after they did, which they thought at first might be the cause of their death, "we found out later that something we had each done changed the world through a ripple effect, so the world isn't as random as you would think." So, there is evidence that Rhett and Sam might have saved two of the three from dying.

**Critique**: There's not enough evidence to suggest that Rhett and Sam might have saved two of the three.

**Rationale**: The critique states that there is not enough evidence to suggest that Rhett and Sam might have saved two of the three. However, it does not provide any information or implications about what the correct interpretation should be. Without additional details or guidance on what the correct interpretation is, I cannot improve the answer. The critique points out a flaw but does not offer a direction for correction or improvement.

In recent years, Emmanuel De Luca Bossa has been taken into custody multiple times, and recently Umberto De Luca Bossa was released from prison. Meanwhile, the group is believed by Italian authorities to be gaining power again in the Vesuvian area. Members of the group are known primarily for their use of violence and extortion in order to perpetrate illegal activity.

### Sample 418/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Why does the narrator think it's selfish of her to want her grandma to remain alive?

**Answer**: The narrator thinks it's selfish of her to want her grandma to remain alive because death is not a romanticized experience like films make it out to be. Instead, it's a final, drawn-out whimper that brings a person's life full circle, having them return to a state where they are helpless and confused, like a newborn.

**Critique**: It is omitted that the narrator knows that staying alive would only mean more suffering for her grandmother but she still wanted her to live.

### Sample 425/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Jeanne Ann Westveer was born in 1935. Jeanne married John Frederick Girard Rooks in 1960. She is the mother of my mother, making her my grandmother. When I’m writing this, my grandma is in the hospital, but she is supposed to go home tomorrow. Jeanne Ann Rooks is dying. 

When I was eleven, my grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease. Now, after eight years, she is a shell of the person she used to be. My grandma cannot function on her own. She is completely reliant on others to sustain her. This is of course not at all what Jeanne used to be. My grandma was an amazing pianist and singer. She played at her and my grandpa’s church for years until the disease hit. But, now she cannot. 

Because of this, I know it’s time. 

My brother and I used to go over to my grandparents’ house quite a bit. They had a lot of land and we would be outside for most of the time we spent there. I remember helping my grandma plant flowers around the outside of the house and getting stung by a bee. I remember my grandpa and grandma and I painting in the kitchen. I did my first oil painting when I was one years old at their house with their help. My grandma loved my love for the arts. We don’t talk about the arts anymore. We don’t talk at all really. I’ll tell her things going on in life and ask her if she’s comfortable. 

Because of this, I know it’s time. 

Only a few years ago, my grandma could still make words. When my grandpa and her came over dinner once, I helped her to the living room. As she struggled to walk she told me “I hate getting old.” While I think everyone would agree with that opinion for the most part, I think she meant it deeper. My whole life, my grandma was old. What wasn’t old was her mind. Until now that is. 

Because of this, I know it’s time. 

And I know I shouldn’t be sad about it. Life could only get worse for Jeanne. This is the right time. To want her to stay is selfish of me. After death, she’ll have a much better life. What makes it hard is remembering what she was like before the disease. The last few years I’ve only thought of my grandma as bed-ridden and limited. That’s how everyone saw her. I forgot about who she actually was. I forgot about her sitting at the piano and singing, and I forgot about the hundreds of peanut butter and jam sandwiches she made for me. I forgot about her setting up the Super Nintendo for my brother and I when we came over, or when she would grab me a nickel from the high cupboard so I could get a gumball from their machine. 

Now, when I’m sitting at her bedside holding her hand, and seeing her slowly fade away, I know it’s time. But, I don’t want her to go. 

Because death isn’t a romanticized experience like films make it out to be. It doesn’t bring families together in some grand fashion that ultimately ends up to be a necessary learning experience for everyone. Death is a final, drawn-out whimper. 

Death brings a person’s life full circle, having them return to a state where they are helpless and confused, like a newborn. 

Because of this I know it’s time. But, I don’t want her to go.

**Critique**: Contains a lot of information that could be omitted.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer "contains a lot of information that could be omitted," but it does not specify which information is unnecessary or how to condense the content. Without specific guidance on what to remove, it is impossible to make a concrete improvement to the answer without referring back to the source material to determine which parts are essential and which are not. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer.

**Critique**: It is omitted that the narrator thinks of the time she spent with her grandmother.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the answer is missing information about the narrator reflecting on the time spent with their grandmother.

**Question**: Explain how the battles run endlessly.

**Answer**: The battles between the two kingdoms seem to never end, as they keep resurrecting their dead and fighting endlessly. This is because neither side seems to be able to empathize with the other, and so they are stuck in a stalemate. However, when the prince and his band of fools taunt the two kingdoms, they put their differences aside and finally see the true enemy - the sticky tarry foe. They then go on to win a long and difficult battle, which benefits everyone.

**Critique**: The last two sentences are not directly addressing the question being asked.

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The two kingdoms are at war with each other. The prince and his seven fools taunt the two kingdoms from afar. The two kingdoms unite to destroy the prince and his fools. They win the battle and the war.

**Critique**: Using "the" for the prince may mislead someone into thinking the prince belongs to one of the kingdoms.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that using "the" before "prince" might imply that the prince is associated with one of the kingdoms, which could be misleading. To improve the answer, you can change "the prince" to "a prince" or "an independent prince" to clarify that he is not affiliated with either kingdom. This change can be made without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides enough information to make a specific adjustment to the wording.

**Answer**: Two kingdoms, one to the West and the other to the East, fight ceaselessly. Battle after battle, they resurrect their dead and fight on. One day a Prince appears, taunting them both with vulgar songs. The kingdoms unite and fight a long battle for the betterment of all.

**Critique**: Could clarify that the kingdoms unite against the prince.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the kingdoms unite specifically to fight against the prince, which is a clarification that can be directly applied to improve the answer. This implies that the unification is a response to the prince's actions, rather than a general effort for the betterment of all. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 437/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: In this story, two kingdoms are at war with each other until a prince and his band of fools taunt them both. The two kingdoms then put aside their differences and unite to fight the tarry foe, which they eventually defeat.

**Critique**: The phrase "tarry foe" does not seem to be applied to the prince.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the phrase "tarry foe" is incorrectly applied to the prince and his band of fools. This implies that the phrase should be associated with something else, likely the actual enemy the kingdoms unite against. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by removing or correcting the application of "tarry foe" to the prince and his band of fools, and instead associating it with the correct adversary.

**Answer**: 15 years, 7 months

**Critique**: This is false. She would have been 16 considering the European Youth Summer Olympics Festival took place in the summer. Her birthday is in March.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It states that Helena Jiranová's birthday is in March and that the European Youth Summer Olympics Festival took place in the summer, which implies she would have been 16 years old at the time of the competition.

**Critique**: Being that the 2011 European Youth Summer Olympic Festival was in the summer and Helena's birthday is in March, she would be 16.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the timing of the event and Helena Jiranová's birthday, allowing us to correct the age mentioned in the answer. The critique implies that since the event was in the summer and her birthday is in March, she would have turned 16 by the time of the competition.

**Critique**: She technically could have been 18 because the article doesn't say what month the tournament took place in. It would be safer to say she was either 18 or 19.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by suggesting a safer way to phrase Jiranová's age due to the lack of information about the exact month of the tournament. It implies that the answer should be adjusted to account for the uncertainty in her age, suggesting the use of "either 18 or 19."

**Critique**: She technically could have been 19 because the article doesn't say what month the tournament took place in. It would be safer to say she was either 18 or 19.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by suggesting a more accurate way to phrase the information. It implies that the exact age cannot be confirmed due to the lack of information about the month of the tournament.

**Rationale**: The critique provides enough information to improve the answer. It implies that the birthdate and the year of the tournament are available, allowing for a calculation of Jiranová's age at the time of her first tournament win.

**Critique**: 400 "mile" race is incorrect. She ran a 400 meter race.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that corrects the error in the answer. It states that the race was 400 meters, not 400 miles. With this information, I can improve the answer by correcting the distance of the race from "400 mile" to "400 meter." This correction allows me to write a more accurate answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: The first sentence is unnecessary for answering the question.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the first sentence is unnecessary for answering the question about Jiranová's speed. This implies that the answer should focus solely on her personal best times in the specified events, which are directly related to her speed.

**Critique**: The information is given. It says she stumbles. It's also contradictory to give information about her stumble after saying there is no info given.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a contradiction in the answer, which states that no information is given about why Jiranová retired from the race, yet it also describes her stumbling and falling. The critique implies that the answer should acknowledge the provided information about her stumble as the reason for her retirement. Therefore, the answer can be improved by removing the statement that no information is given and instead focusing on the stumble as the reason for her retirement.

### Sample 451/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Helena Jiranová is a Czech runner who specializes in the 400 meters, 110 metre hurdles and 60 metre hurdles. In 2017, Jiranová won the Czech national championship in the 400 meters and was part of the 4 × 400 metres relay team that won the Czech championship in 2019. In 2017, she placed 8th at the European Young Athletics Championships in the 400 metres dash and 6th in the 100 metre hurdles. Recently, at the 2019 European Games, Jiranová placed 12th in the field of hurdlers. Jiranová also currently holds personal bests in the 400 meters (53.77 seconds), 100 metre hurdles (13.37 seconds) and 60 metre hurdles (8.31 seconds).

**Critique**: There is no mention in the article of Helena winning the Czech national championship in the 400 meters. It's only said she had her personal best in 400 meters in Prague in 2017. It would be better to remove this since her personal best is mentioned later in the summary.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the claim about Helena Jiranová winning the Czech national championship in the 400 meters is not mentioned in the article. Instead, it states that she achieved her personal best in the 400 meters in Prague in 2017. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the incorrect statement about her winning the championship and ensuring the summary accurately reflects the information about her personal best, which is already mentioned later in the summary.

Jiranová has experienced some success in international competitions, placing eighth in the 4 × 400 metres relay at the European Athletics Junior Championships and sixth in the 100 meters hurdles at the European Athletics U23 Championships.

**Critique**: Jiranova is not ranked first in Czech Republic in the 400 metres, fourth in the 60 meters hurdles, and eighth in the 100 meters hurdles. This whole sentence needs to be mended, as it is entirely false.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the rankings provided in the answer are incorrect and need to be corrected. However, it does not provide the correct rankings or any specific information to replace the false statement. Without the correct rankings or additional details, I cannot improve the answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

**Answer**: David tells the story of his mid-twenties during an extended period of unemployment to the unemployment office worker recording his story. He laments the lack of structure in unemployment before going to the gym where he lifts weights and the girl he fucks regularly who has been depressed for a long time. He recognizes himself as not really loving or liking this girl he is sleeping with. David describes the events leading to his finding and killing a small animal in the dark, and then driving home in his car.

**Critique**: The narrator is not named. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the narrator is not named, which implies that the use of the name "David" in the answer is incorrect. Without needing to refer back to the source material, the editor can improve the answer by removing the name "David" and replacing it with a neutral term like "the narrator" or "he." This change aligns with the critique's implication that the narrator's name is not provided in the source material.

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: 

**Critique**: no answer

**Rationale**: The critique "no answer" does not provide any information or guidance on how to improve the current answer. It simply states that there is no answer, which does not help in creating or improving an answer without referring back to the source material. There is no implication or suggestion on what the content should be or how to approach the summary. Therefore, I cannot write a better answer using only the question, current answer, and critique.

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Due to onsetting premature balding, anxiety, and a dead animal, the protagonist is backed into a decision between quitting his job, or returning to college. Just as he's about to give up his own life, he meets a fox and chooses to ditch the dead animal.

**Critique**: There is no mention of the woman that the narrator has a relationship with. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the summary is missing information about a woman with whom the narrator has a relationship. However, it does not provide any specific details about this relationship or how it should be incorporated into the summary. Without knowing who this woman is or the nature of their relationship, it is impossible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

Matt is forced to resign from his job when he comes upon a balding and downed animal on the highway and can't make a decision about what to do. It is clear, Matt's twenties are truly a 'dead zone' for anxiety

**Critique**: The main character is not named. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the main character is not named, which implies that the name "Matt" used in the answer is incorrect. However, the critique does not provide the correct name of the main character. Without knowing the correct name, I cannot improve the answer. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to find the correct name of the main character.

### Sample 481/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: What did Bitossi do after returning to the factory?

**Answer**: Bitossi became an engineering worker and joined the Italian Federation of Metallurgical Workers (FIOM).

**Critique**: He did this before even being conscripted

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the timeline in the answer is incorrect, as it states that Bitossi became an engineering worker and joined the FIOM before being conscripted, not after returning to the factory. However, the critique does not provide information on what Bitossi did after returning to the factory, which is the question being asked. Without additional information from the source material, we cannot correct the answer to accurately reflect what Bitossi did after returning to the factory.

### Sample 484/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: What did Bitossi do after returning to the factory?

**Answer**: According to the passage, Bitossi became an engineering worker and joined the Italian Federation of Metallurgical Workers (FIOM). He was then elected to the local executive of the union, and was a leading figure in the factory occupations of 1920.

**Critique**: He became an engineering worker before being conscripted; the question asks about what he did after returning following his conscription

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the timeline in the answer is incorrect, specifically that Bitossi became an engineering worker before his conscription, not after returning. However, the critique does not provide information on what Bitossi did after returning from conscription. Therefore, without additional details from the source material, I cannot improve the answer to accurately reflect what Bitossi did after returning.

### Sample 485/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~7 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Renato Bitossi was born in Florence, Italy in 1899. He became an engineering worker and joined the Italian Federation of Metallurgical Workers (FIOM). He was conscripted into the army in 1917, but was demobilised in 1919 and returned to the factory. He was elected to the local executive of the union, and was a leading figure in the factory occupations of 1920. In 1924, he moved to Lyon, France to organize politically among other Italian immigrants. He was arrested and imprisoned until 1932. In 1934, he moved to Milan to work for the party's executive, but he was arrested and confined to Ponza. He organized lectures there, and was not released until 1943. He then returned to Florence and organized armed resistance to the Fascists, and spent a brief period as deputy mayor of the city. He was also elected as chair of the city's Chamber of Labour, and to the executive of the new Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL). In 1946, he was appointed as deputy secretary of CGIL, and moved to Rome; he was also elected to the central committee of the PCd'I. In 1947, he was elected as joint general secretary of CGIL, in which role he argued for centralised wage bargaining. He served as a senator from 1948 until 1968, and from 1961 was the president of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

**Critique**: Shorten by removing information about his move to Lyon

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by indicating which part of the information should be removed to shorten the summary. It explicitly states to remove the information about Renato Bitossi's move to Lyon, which allows for a concrete action to be taken without needing to refer back to the source material. By removing the details about his move to Lyon, the summary can be shortened as suggested.

### Sample 486/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~7 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Renato Bitossi was a prominent Italian trade unionist and communist activist. He was born in Florence in 1899, and became active in the Italian Federation of Metallurgical Workers (FIOM) in the early 1920s. He was a founding member of the Communist Party of Italy (PCd'I) and was elected to the executive of its Florence branch. In 1927, he was arrested and imprisoned for his political activities, but was released in 1943. He then became deputy secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL) and was elected to the central committee of the PCd'I. He served as a senator from 1948 until 1968, and was president of the World Federation of Trade Unions from 1961 until his death in 1969.

**Critique**: Rephrase "In 1927, he was arrested and imprisoned for his political activities, but was released in 1943." to reflect that he was arrested multiple times

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by indicating that the phrasing should reflect multiple arrests rather than a single one. This allows for a concrete improvement to the sentence without needing to refer back to the source material. The editor can rephrase the sentence to accurately convey that Renato Bitossi was arrested multiple times for his political activities, which is a clear and actionable change.

He served as a senator from 1948 until 1968.

**Critique**: Condense information on his arrests into one sentence

**Rationale**: The critique provides a clear directive to condense the information about Renato Bitossi's arrests into one sentence. This implies that the detailed account of his arrests and imprisonments should be summarized, which can be done without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique gives enough information to make a concrete improvement by combining the details of his arrests and imprisonments into a single, concise sentence.

### Sample 488/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why did the narrator feel that he couldn't kill Charlie?


**Answer**: The crash caused their detachment. Possibly he realized the debt he owed Charlie. Or it could be a combination.

**Critique**: I think this should include the type or magnitude of the debt.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the answer should include more specific information about the type or magnitude of the debt the narrator feels he owes Charlie. However, it does not provide any details about what this debt might be. Without access to the source material, it is impossible to determine the specifics of the debt, making it impossible to improve the answer based solely on the critique. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

Why did the narrator kill Charlie in the end?

**Answer**: He felt Charlie should have died in that accident to save him from all the pain and emotion he has been through since.

**Critique**: It's the opposite: he thinks Charlie should have let him die.

**Rationale**: The critique provides a clear indication of what the correct information should be by stating "it's the opposite: he thinks Charlie should have let him die." This implies that the answer should be revised to reflect that the narrator believes Charlie should have let the narrator die, rather than the other way around. Therefore, I can improve the answer by changing the perspective to align with the critique's guidance.

### Sample 490/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~17 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Fifteen years ago, the narrator’s parents and fiancée died in an accident. He was the sole survivor. Six other people died. On that night so did his soul. He had no conscience. One day he was approached by a man who told him that the Irish mobsters weren’t happy with his con jobs. He could make amends by doing a hit. 

Over ten years he became the main hitman for the Irish mob in the Boston area. He got off on the job. One day, the narrator was called to kill the owner of a deli in the area where he grew up. When he approached the man, he realized that they had been friends at school. In the fifth grade, Charlie Brennan, the hit, had saved the narrator’s life. 

The narrator couldn’t kill Charlie. He told Charlie a bit about his life, told him what he had given back to him. The memories flooded his brain. After an hour of talking, he got up to leave. He wrapped a garotte around Charlie’s neck and told him that he should have let him die then he would have been saved the pain of the accident.  


**Critique**: It should specify that the two men chatted amicably and then when Charlie got up to leave, the narrator killed him.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the interaction between the narrator and Charlie, indicating that they chatted amicably before the narrator killed Charlie. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding the detail about their amicable conversation and clarifying the sequence of events leading to Charlie's death. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it provides enough information to enhance the summary without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 491/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~17 sentence summary.

**Answer**: My soul is icy cold. My soul is what the narrator feels when they hear their loss of their loved ones. Shortly after, the narrator tries to drug and drink themselves to death, but it doesn’t work. While being approached by someone to perform a hit, he gets involved with the Irish Mob. Day by day, he does more.

The narrator talks of feelings, and partying with Charlie Brennan. With Charlie was a Mr. Brennan. The story quickly moves to the killing of Mr. Brennan.

Mr. Brennan and the narrator are obviously in a similar situation, as they are both named Brennan. Mr. Brennan says he has no option but to pay the protection money as he has a family deli to run.

**Critique**: The first two sentences stick out as being oddly first-person. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the first two sentences are in the first person, which is inconsistent with the rest of the summary that uses third-person narration. This implies that the first two sentences should be rewritten to match the third-person perspective used throughout the rest of the summary. Therefore, I can improve the answer by changing "My soul is icy cold. My soul is what the narrator feels when they hear their loss of their loved ones." to "The narrator's soul is icy cold. This is what they feel when they hear about the loss of their loved ones." This adjustment aligns the narrative perspective consistently throughout the summary.

### Sample 492/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~17 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator was a survivor of a car accident in which he lost his people. He sought to take his life in various ways, but he couldn't. 15 years into being a survivor, he would hear about a hit and be engaged in it. He became very good at it and used it to fill the void. 

He met One Thumb McShane who gave him a job. He was tasked to kill a girl's dad. Charlie turned out to be the girl's father. They forge a connection again. The narrator silence Charlie with his garrote.

**Critique**: This needs to outline the steps of his life and the story. This is so vague. The story is not. It needs to state the occupation of the narrator, how they ended up that way, why they wandered into the deli that day, whom they were surprised to meet, and why they killed the guy despite their rapport. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific elements that need to be included in the summary, such as outlining the steps of the narrator's life, stating the narrator's occupation, explaining how they ended up in their current situation, why they wandered into the deli, whom they were surprised to meet, and why they killed the person despite having a rapport. These details give clear guidance on how to improve the summary by adding specific information. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it allows for a concrete improvement of the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Write a ~17 sentence summary.

**Answer**: After being in a fatal car accident 15 years ago, the main character became completely numb and started killing people. A former friend recognized him and they had a talk. The main character decided killing his old friend was wrong, however, he ultimately ended up garroting Charlie anyway. He re experiences the pain of the car accident, realizing what Charlie had given him and now finds himself once again without emotion and emptiness in his life.

**Critique**: It needs to state the occupation of the narrator, how they ended up that way, why they wandered into the deli that day, whom they were surprised to meet, and why they killed the guy despite their rapport. 

**Rationale**: The critique identifies several specific pieces of information that are missing from the answer: the occupation of the narrator, how they ended up in their current situation, why they wandered into the deli, whom they were surprised to meet, and why they killed the person despite having a rapport. However, the critique does not provide any of this information directly or imply what the correct details are. Without these specifics, it is impossible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to fill in these gaps.

### Sample 494/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~17 sentence summary.

**Answer**: After a fatal car accident fifteen years ago, the protagonist lost all feeling or emotion. He turns to being a hit-man in order to feel something again. He was paid to kill a deli owner who had stopped paying protection money to the mob and he ended up killing his childhood friend Charlie in a moment of nostalgia. The assassination reinstates the cold emptiness within him.

**Critique**: I added what happened in the car accident and then referenced it when the narrator kills Charlie. I also replaced the word "protagonist" with "narrator". 

**Rationale**: The critique mentions adding details about the car accident and making a reference to it when the narrator kills Charlie. However, it does not specify what exactly happened in the car accident, so I cannot add that information without consulting the source material. Additionally, the critique suggests replacing "protagonist" with "narrator," which is a specific and actionable change. While I can make the change from "protagonist" to "narrator," I cannot fully improve the answer regarding the car accident details without additional information.

**Question**: Who is the child in the story?

**Answer**: The child in the story is an adolescent.

**Critique**: The answer is false because the narrator says the boy wasn't quite into his teens. He could be described as a child in early adolescence however. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the boy is not quite into his teens, which implies he is younger than an adolescent. The critique also suggests that he could be described as a child in early adolescence.

### Sample 515/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator witnesses a young boy caught in the midst of a devastating natural disaster. The child begs for the narrator not to leave him, but he is ultimately unable to save him and the boy dies in his arms. With the death of the boy, the tragedy is forever seared into the narrator's memory.

**Critique**: "devastating natural disaster" it's not clear if it was a natural or manmade disaster.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the type of disaster is unclear, suggesting that the current answer may inaccurately describe the event as a natural disaster. However, it does not provide information on what the correct description should be, whether it is natural or manmade. Without knowing the correct type of disaster, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to confirm the nature of the disaster.

### Sample 516/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator witnesses a young boy dying in a bombed-out street and can only listen as the boy begs him not to leave him. The experience haunts him forever, never forgetting what it feels like to see someone so young and innocent lose everything.

**Critique**: "never forgetting what it feels like to see someone so young and innocent lose everything" isn't necessarily implied in the story. It seems that the man is more haunted by the fact that he couldn't save the boy.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what aspect of the narrator's experience is emphasized in the story. It suggests that the haunting aspect is more about the inability to save the boy rather than the feeling of seeing someone lose everything. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by shifting the focus of the haunting experience to the narrator's inability to save the boy. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it provides enough information to revise the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 517/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator wakes up in a crumbled building or destroyed alley, presumably after a bombing. There is a teenage boy who is crushed under part of a collapsed roof. He has been screaming and is bleeding significantly. The boy continually repeats, "Ne me quitte pas" meaning, "don't leave me". Soldiers come to get the narrator; they leave the boy.

**Critique**: It's inaccurate to call the boy a teenager because he is referred to as "a small child, maybe not quite into his teens".  

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the boy should not be referred to as a teenager, but rather as "a small child, maybe not quite into his teens." This allows the editor to adjust the description of the boy in the summary without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 518/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: In the midst of a war-torn city stands a small boy desperately pleading for the newly arrived man not to leave him. But with his fading voice and slowly closing distance, he learns that despite his efforts, the boy's pleas fall on deaf ears. The man can do nothing but watch in pained sorrow as the child's screams go silent. Nightmarish memories of the event haunt him for the rest of his days.

**Critique**: It's not said in the story that the city is war-torn. What happened is ambiguous, so it would be better not to definitively describe it.  

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by indicating that the description of the city as "war-torn" is not supported by the story. It suggests that the situation is ambiguous, which implies that the answer should be revised to reflect this ambiguity rather than definitively stating the city is war-torn. Therefore, the answer can be improved by removing or altering the phrase "war-torn city" to something less specific, such as "a city in turmoil" or simply "a city," to align with the ambiguity mentioned in the critique.

### Sample 519/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The unnamed protagonist watches as a young boy is trapped beneath debris from a collapsed building. Despite the boy's pleading for help, he's left behind, only to be haunted by his cries for the rest of his life.

**Critique**: "only to be haunted by his cries" sounds like the boy is haunted by cries. Specify that it's the man. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out a potential ambiguity in the sentence "only to be haunted by his cries for the rest of his life," which could be misinterpreted as the boy being haunted rather than the protagonist. The critique suggests specifying that it is the man who is haunted. This provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by clarifying the sentence to indicate that the protagonist is the one haunted by the cries. For example, the sentence could be revised to "only for the man to be haunted by the boy's cries for the rest of his life."

**Critique**: Start the summary off with the man's perspective of being unable to move or speak. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific instruction to start the summary with the man's perspective of being unable to move or speak. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by rearranging the existing information to focus on the man's perspective first. The critique does not require additional information from the source material to make this change.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies a specific issue with the structure of the sentence, indicating that it is a run-on sentence. This provides enough information to improve the answer by breaking it into shorter, more concise sentences. For example, the answer could be revised to: "A 1994 bronze sculpture installed in Boston's Copley Square, Massachusetts, commemorates Boston Marathon participants.

**Rationale**: The critique points out the repetition of the phrase "the partner is in a bad mood" four times. This implies that the repetition should be reduced or eliminated to improve the answer. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can revise the answer to avoid redundancy by summarizing the partner's mood more concisely, such as: "The narrator wakes up with their partner, who is in a bad mood.

He's a creative killer who collects markers related to his victims, gathering contigencies to ensure they have his identity to track down. Jason picks his next target in Barry Kindle, a former cop, who has likely killed in the line of duty. He's not a known killer, and his next crime will take him into a vast new world hunting as a maniacal, evil bug, he says.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the narrator is not on trial but is on his way to jail, which can be directly incorporated into the summary.

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: A convicted criminal tells the story of the last crime he committed before being caught and put into prison. He reminisces on the crime he committed and how much it resembles a developmental puzzle by planning out all the possible places hidden evidence could be found. He also believes that the reason detectives aren't able to catch the criminal (known as in later text as Zodiac) is because he spreads out his murders to be committed at specific times of years in order to throw off any suspicion that leads to their identities.

**Critique**: We don't know if Emma's murder was the last crime Jason committed before getting caught. Almost all of the answer is wrong and should be re-written.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the information provided in the answer is mostly incorrect and suggests that the entire answer should be re-written. However, it does not provide any specific details or corrections that would allow for a concrete improvement of the answer without referring back to the source material. The critique mentions uncertainty about Emma's murder being the last crime, but it does not clarify what the correct information should be.

**Critique**: "The temporary nature of a relationship" is too general. The story is just a single encounter, and the temporariness is only for it.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the story is about a single encounter, which implies that the title "Finite" refers to the temporariness of that specific encounter rather than a broader relationship. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by focusing on the single encounter aspect.

**Question**: Why does Sharon suspect Mike is cheating on her?

**Answer**: Sharon suspects Mike is cheating on her because she saw him leaving her coworker's office, and the coworker had a strawberry-flavored dessert that Mike always brought to Sharon.

**Critique**: The statement about the strawberry-flavored dessert is inaccurate. He usually brings her Sharon a chocolate dessert. And there is not evidence that the coworker had a strawberry-flavored dessert.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It corrects the type of dessert Mike usually brings to Sharon from strawberry-flavored to chocolate, and it also indicates that there is no evidence of the coworker having a strawberry-flavored dessert. With this information, the answer can be revised to remove the inaccurate statement about the strawberry-flavored dessert and correct the type of dessert Mike brings to Sharon. Therefore, the critique allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

The current answer incorrectly attributes the laughter to Mike, but the critique clarifies that it is the coworker who laughs. This allows the editor to revise the sentence to accurately reflect the situation without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: He always brings her cheesecake, and she tastes strawberry on his lips.

**Critique**: The fact that he always brings her cheesecake is not evidence that he is cheating on her.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the reason given in the answer (that Mike always brings Sharon cheesecake) is not valid evidence for suspecting cheating. However, it does not provide an alternative reason or suggest what might be considered valid evidence. Without additional information or a suggestion of what could be a valid reason, I cannot improve the answer.

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Sharon didn't want his death the be too painful, even though that bastard deserved it. Cheating on her with that bitch at the office. Not his office even, her office. Her husband Mike would often visit her at work during lunch. It was always a surprise to see him there, right when Sharon got back from lunch, sitting in her desk chair.

But this particular day something different happened. Mike was there, but he wasn't waiting in Sharon’s chair. No, Mike was coming out of her coworker’s office. Sharon saw her giggle at him as he left and make a sly shhhh sign with her finger. They both nervously laughed as Mike walked away with a prideful grin on his face. He would almost always have with him chocolate cheesecake- Sharon’s favorite food. Then they would eat together and Mike would give her a short peck on the lips and leave. That’s how she knew he was cheating on her. She tasted something on Mike’s lips that day, something sweet. It wasn't the chocolate cheesecake though. No, this was a sweet strawberry flavor upon his this lips that she tasted.

Mike made a lot of money. He was a writer for a popular newspaper company in New York. Sharon hardly made any money. She didn't even have to work actually, Mike made more than enough to keep them both more than alive and happy. Mike was kinda famous too. He wrote the political cartoons for the paper. Sometimes people would recognize him in resturaunts or places like that. They would come up to him with a big smile and shake his hand or ask for a picture. They wouldn’t even acknowledge Sharon. And that made her mad.

Melissa. That’s the bitch that was doing her husband at her workplace. Sharon wasn’t completely sure it was Melissa, but it was most likely her. Melissa wasn't even that pretty, at least not in Sharon’s eyes. Melissa had to have been at least forty with her brown hair that was starting to show strands of grey. Sharon’s hair had more grey in her blonde hair, she used products to keep it from showing, but it never seemed to work for her. Melissa was also kinda plump. Not fat by any means, but not close to skinny either. Sharon was skinny. Too skinny. She had lost a lot of weight lately and she didn't know why. Maybe Mike didn't like her being skinny, maybe he wanted something more plump like Melissa. That’s what Sharon figured at least.

Poison. That’s how Mike was going to die. Sharon got the poison from a guy in

**Question**: What is Olivewood?

**Answer**: Olivewood is a term used to describe Cyprus' efforts to become a high-value film production destination. The island offers a variety of locations, climate, and incentives to filmmakers. Popular genres filmed on the island include action, comedy, sci-fi, romance, and drama.

**Critique**: The different features of the island are not relevant to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the different features of the island are not relevant to the question. This implies that the answer should focus more on what "Olivewood" specifically refers to, rather than the features of Cyprus.

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Olivewood is a metonymy and the official marking of Cyprus efforts to mature into a high value movie production destination. The term is a portmanteau of “Olive” and “Hollywood”. The strategy is predominantly allied to filmmaking for the Cinema of the United States and the Cinema of Europe. Cyprus climate, landscapes, local talent, infrastructure and financial incentives has boosted its film industry more meaningfully in the past few years. Labelled as a natural film studio, the island has a diverse set of film locations and dissimilar morphology. Cyprus incorporates a historical and cultural landscape ranging from archaeological sites to antiquated villages, ancient city kingdoms, Greek amphitheatres, Byzantine art, 16th century Venetian architecture and modern European cities such as Limassol. Its long coastline, sandy beaches, light houses, ports, as well as pristine Mediterranean waters have been shot in various movie productions. The island incorporates flat plains that look like desert in the summer only to transform with rich green vegetation during the winter. Troodos Mountains provides peaks covered in snow, hilltops, valleys, waterfalls, traditional villages and vineyards. Salt lakes in Larnaca are packed with flamingos in the winter while the Akamas Nature Reserve is protected from any human activities. Notably, the island is the mythological birthplace of Aphrodite.

### Sample 689/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Are there regional variations?

**Answer**: There appear to be regional variations in the way honey toast is prepared, with some versions being more elaborate than others.

**Critique**: It seems 'elaborate' was used as an antonym to rephrase 'subdued' but that's not correct in the context; 'subdued' here means milder, less sweet, not necessarily simpler in preparation. Swap 'elaborate' for 'subdued', to retain the original meaning.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by suggesting a direct substitution of the word "elaborate" with "subdued" to accurately convey the intended meaning. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: Honey toast is a Japanese dessert that originated from the district of Shibuya during the Japanese asset price bubble.

**Critique**: The asset price bubble is not the most relevant detail; the summary would be better served by a description of the dessert itself.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the summary should focus more on describing the dessert rather than mentioning the historical context of its origin. However, it does not provide specific details about what the dessert is or its characteristics. Without additional information about the dessert itself, I cannot improve the answer to include a description of honey toast. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to know what to write about the dessert's description.

**Critique**: This answer only summarises how shahid met Malala but doesn't explicitly say what their relationship was.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer does not explicitly state the nature of the relationship between Shahid and Malala, only how they met. However, it does not provide any information or implications about what the relationship actually is.

However, the critique does not provide any information or implication about what the police actually said. Without additional details or guidance on what the police said, I cannot improve the answer.

**Question**: What does Die Sine Timere mean?

**Answer**: The narrator translates it roughly as "day without fear."

**Critique**: There is no indication that this is a rough translation. Unless the answer comes from someone who knows Latin well enough to judge it. 

Having the term "roughly" can be misinterpreted as that the translation could have another meaning, which would further confuse the reader. 

**Rationale**: The critique suggests removing the word "roughly" from the translation to avoid confusion, as it implies uncertainty about the translation's accuracy. This is a clear and actionable suggestion that can be implemented without needing to refer back to the source material. By removing "roughly," the answer becomes more precise and less ambiguous.

"So they fought and fought for years. Finally, one day everyone woke up from sleeping and realized that they had killed off more than half the people on Earth. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides information that contradicts the current answer, indicating that the story is set many years after the wars ended, which occurred long after 2015 but well before 3045. This implies that the setting is not in 3045, but rather in a time period closer to the end of the wars. However, the critique does not specify the exact year or time period when the story is set, only that it is not 3045. Therefore, without the source material, it is not possible to determine the correct year or time period for the setting based solely on the critique.

For one day a year, we remember our unity and how lucky we are to be at peace.

**Rationale**: The critique provides several plausible themes for the story, such as "war," "unity," "peace," "innocence," and "parenthood." Additionally, the critique includes a statement about remembering unity and peace, which can be used to infer a theme. Using this information, I can improve the answer by selecting one of the suggested themes or combining them to form a more comprehensive theme statement. For example, I could revise the answer to say, "The theme of the story is unity and peace, as it reflects on how society comes together to celebrate and remember the importance of these values."

Mrs. Cardicole tells him they are pulling their strings every time the bell rings specifically so they can meet up in the hallway. One day, the Ardalent's (or demon) string goes taut and mute and all the residents are silent and in the hallway. The strings come back in automatically, no Lester there, and when Oliver investigates, no Lester or Sable either. The residents are unsettled, and Oliver decides to not look for any more about their participation in the ritual. Going against the routine, Mrs. Cardicole only feeds the Ardalent small portions of their bodies this time, keeps some and has a new baby in the end.

When his string had been pulled taut, a bell would ring. This happened each day at the same time. After pulling his, he would meet with the rest of the residents in the hallway and they would stare at each other trying to figure out the mystery. Oliver thought it was backwards that the residents of that particular building responded to a bell without knowing who was in control of it.

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: William Jones is credited with first using the symbol of π to represent the concept of the ratio between a circle's circumference and diameter. The mathematical formula itself has been recognized as a universal ratio for several thousand years. Pioneers in mathematics like the Sumerians and Greeks believed that no matter how large or small a circle was, the ratio of 3.14159265 was a constant. 

One individual was determined to do his own independent research on the sacred laws of Pi. He was determined to find a meaningful exception to the universal reliability of Pi. He experimented with sophisticated math algorithms and controversial new research data. He cross-multiplied base integers in intricate ways. He applied square and cubed roots to each part of his equations to see if it might affect the never-changing outcome. Try as he might, the long-forgotten gods who invented quantum physics were determined to foil his efforts to find a flaw in their system. The exception to the rule of Pi remained elusive.

They take one of Tobias' guns and also take the girlfriend he was with, and the leader tells Tobias they did it for the revolutionaries as they drove off.

**Critique**: 'Tobias Kelly goes to the coffee shop which is about to go out of business run by a decent employee.'
The model names the narrator Tobias Kelly, which is not proven in the story. Also, he was already in the coffee shop at the start of the story. There is also no mention of the coffee shop being run by a decent employee.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It indicates that the name "Tobias Kelly" is not proven in the story, suggesting that the name should be removed or replaced with a more accurate description of the character. It also clarifies that the character was already in the coffee shop at the start of the story, which implies that the phrasing should be adjusted to reflect this. Additionally, the critique points out that there is no mention of the coffee shop being run by a decent employee, suggesting that this detail should be removed.

**Critique**: He is not rescued by the Land Fauna

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the fish is not rescued by the Land Fauna, which directly contradicts the resolution provided in the answer. This implies that the resolution involving the Land Fauna is incorrect and should be removed or corrected.

He eventually succeeds in catching a line thrown by a land-fauna, but is injured in the process. He passes out before he can find out what happens next. From the description, it seems that Mike's plan was successful, and he is on his way to finding the answers he seeks.

**Critique**: He is not successful it is implied that he dies

**Rationale**: The critique provides a clear implication that the current answer is incorrect regarding the outcome of Mike's journey. It states that Mike is not successful and implies that he dies. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the part that suggests Mike's plan was successful and that he is on his way to finding answers.

**Critique**: Ralph Josselyn's political career is more important than his birth and death dates.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the focus of the summary should be more on Ralph Josselyn's political career rather than his birth and death dates. However, it does not provide specific details about his political career that should be included, such as particular achievements or roles.

### Sample 784/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Ralph Josselyn was a 15th-century English politician who held several political offices, including two terms as Lord Mayor of London. He was a member of the Worshipful Company of Drapers, of which he would become the Master in 1457-8. He became an alderman, of Cornhill Ward, in 1456. In 1464 he was elected to the first of his two mayoral terms. During this term, he was one of four London citizens made a Knight of the Bath, at the coronation of Edward IV's queen, Elizabeth Woodville. After his first mayoral term, Josselyn continued to be active in the city's affairs. He was elected to Parliament, representing the City of London, in 1467. In 1471, he raised a force to repel the assault of Thomas Neville, Bastard of Fauconbridge, when the latter attacked the city in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue the imprisoned King Henry VI from the Tower of London. Josselyn was elected to a second term as mayor in 1476. During this term, he initiated a huge effort to repair the city's walls, which had fallen into grave disrepair. He procured massive quantities of bricks and lime, levied taxes to pay for the significant costs of the repairs, and provided for the work to be supervised by a hand-picked panel of citizens representing each of the city's wards. He also took measures to curb the abuses of bakers and victuallers within the city. Josselyn seems to have married three times. His first wife, Margery, may have been either the daughter or the widow of another draper, Thomas Aylesby. His second wife, Philippa, was the daughter of Philip Malpas, another London alderman and (unlike Josselyn) a staunch Lancastrian; her sister married Thomas Cooke, another mayor of London. His third wife was Elizabeth Barley, daughter of William Barley and sister of Henry Barley, MP for Hertfordshire; she survived him and married Sir Robert Clifford, son of Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron Clifford. She and her new husband were sued by her father over ownership of a manor in Linslade, previously owned by Josselyn. Josselyn died on 25 October 1478 and was buried at St Swithin's Church in London, of which he had been a benefactor; a memorial erected to him in Sawbridgeworth church has caused some authors to state he was buried there. He seems to have had no surviving children, as his heir was his nephew George Josselyn, son of his elder brother Thomas.

**Critique**: The answer almost copies the entire article. It should be completely rewritten within the limitations mentioned by the question.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the current answer is too detailed and closely resembles the original source material, suggesting that it should be rewritten to fit the requirement of a ~3 sentence summary. However, the critique does not provide specific guidance on which details to include or exclude to create a concise summary. Without additional information on what aspects are most important or relevant, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to determine which details are essential for a brief summary.

**Question**: Write a ~2 sentence summary.

**Answer**: It seems that the EGS:NP characters have found themselves amid a pack of Velociraptors - clever girls, at that! The repercussions and results of such a meeting will be evident next Wednesday.

**Critique**: The summary seems to be taking into inference that there is a pack of Velociraptors, which doesn't necessarily have to be the case. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the inference of a "pack of Velociraptors" may not be accurate, but it does not provide any specific information on what should be included instead. Without knowing what the correct scenario is, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the actual situation involving the EGS:NP characters.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why does the main character want to commit suicide?

**Answer**: The main character wants to commit suicide because they cannot find a reason to stick around in the face of uncertainty. The view from the bridge is beautiful, but it is not enough to convince them to change their mind and reconsider their choice. They feel empty inside and feel that there is nothing left for them in this world.

**Critique**: The world is not enough

**Rationale**: The critique "The world is not enough" does not provide specific information or guidance on how to improve the answer. It is a vague statement that does not clarify what is incorrect or what should be added or changed in the current answer.

### Sample 851/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: What happened to humans?

**Answer**: Humans became extinct.

**Critique**: Though the humans lost billions, extinction means there are none left. There are 5 humans left. Furthermore, this answer doesn't address the cause, and therefore doesn't answer the question.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that there are still 5 humans left, which allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the statement about extinction. However, the critique also mentions that the answer doesn't address the cause of what happened to humans, but it does not provide any information or implication about what the cause might be. Therefore, while the critique allows for a partial improvement (correcting the extinction claim), it does not provide enough information to fully address the question about what happened to humans, as it lacks details on the cause.

**Critique**: Does not specify who McCabe is.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer lacks information about who McCabe is. However, it does not provide any specific details or context about McCabe's identity or role.

**Question**: Why is the author confused?

**Answer**: The author is confused about the accusations against McCabe.

**Critique**: While this is correct, it does not explain what is confusing about the specific accustations.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer lacks an explanation of what specifically is confusing about the accusations against McCabe. However, it does not provide any details or implications about what those specific confusions might be. Without additional information or context, it is not possible to improve the answer to include what is confusing about the accusations.

### Sample 888/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Why is the author confused?

**Answer**: The author is confused because the article does not make it clear whether McCabe leaked information to the press or whether he authorized others to do so.

**Critique**: This isn't completely correct. It is clear that he authorized others to do so. The question is whether that classifies as a leak and therefore misconduct.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It clarifies that McCabe authorized others to leak information, which is a key detail missing from the original answer. The critique also suggests that the confusion lies in whether this action constitutes a leak and misconduct. Therefore, the answer can be improved by stating that the author is confused about whether McCabe's authorization of others to leak information classifies as a leak and misconduct. This can be done without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: What was the investigation he leaked concerned with?

**Answer**: The investigation he leaked concerned with was the probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server.

**Critique**: Grammar (the phrase "concerned with was" is confusing).

**Rationale**: The critique points out a grammatical issue with the phrase "concerned with was," which is indeed confusing. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by rephrasing it to correct the grammar.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what the investigation was actually concerned with. It clarifies that the investigation was about the FBI and how they handled the probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, rather than the use of the server itself. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the focus of the investigation.

**Question**: What does the narrator mean by "once, we were brothers"?

**Answer**: They were brother combatants and worked together on the same team. The veterans they soldiered with fell out with what they saw, they wanted nothing more to do with combat, they wanted to put it behind them, whereas the narrator felt they had to stay to protect each other.

**Critique**: The second sentence is unclear, especially the part about the narrator wanting to stay.

**Rationale**: The critique identifies that the second sentence is unclear, particularly regarding the narrator's desire to stay. This implies that the sentence should be clarified or rewritten to better convey the intended meaning. The critique does not provide specific information on how to clarify the sentence, but it does indicate which part of the answer needs improvement. However, without additional context or information from the source material, it is challenging to rewrite the sentence accurately.

### Sample 900/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Why does the narrator say "the hippies will avoid us"?

**Answer**: He's referring to the combat and violence he probably perpetuated in Ukraine.

**Critique**: The answer is unclear, or, to be more precise, the connection between the violence and the hippies in unclear. Hippies are generally for peace and against war, so that is probably the reason.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the connection between the violence and the hippies is unclear, but it also provides a probable reason: hippies are generally for peace and against war. This implies that the narrator believes the hippies will avoid them because of their association with violence, which is contrary to the hippies' values. Therefore, the critique provides enough information to improve the answer by clarifying this connection.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 901/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Why does the narrator say "the hippies will avoid us"?

**Answer**: Indicating that the hippies (alternative lifestyle people) will probably tell the public that there's something wrong with people with military backgrounds i.e. like him.

**Critique**: 'There's something wrong with people with military backgrounds' is maybe not the best way to describe it. Hippies are generally against war and for peace.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the phrase "there's something wrong with people with military backgrounds" is not the best description and implies that the hippies' avoidance is due to their general stance against war and for peace. This provides enough information to improve the answer by rephrasing it to reflect the hippies' anti-war sentiment. For example, the answer could be revised to: "Indicating that the hippies, who are generally against war and for peace, will probably avoid people with military backgrounds like him." This improvement can be made without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the remark about the hippies is related to their general stance on peace and war, rather than the brother's beliefs. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by focusing on the hippies' general beliefs instead of the brother's stance.

**Critique**: The second sentence might not be necessary at all.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the second sentence might not be necessary, which implies that the sentence could be removed to improve the answer. Since the critique specifies which part of the answer might be unnecessary, it provides enough information to make a concrete change without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: The answer could also be just that the question is too vague.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the question might be too vague, but it does not provide any specific information or guidance on how to improve the answer regarding the most heroic moment. It does not clarify what could be considered heroic or provide any details that would allow for a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Critique**: The answer completely confuses the characters and the events in the story. The narrator's former brother-in-arms is the one who has the gun to his head now. Also, this has nothing to do with heroism.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer confuses the characters and events, and it also states that the described event has nothing to do with heroism.

At the time of the story, they're at an airport in Crimea. The brother tries to convince the narrator to join him and Russia, but the narrator is not swayed.

**Critique**: It's not that the narrator's former brother-in-arms wants to convince him to come to the Russian side. He wants to kill him.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the brother's intention is not to convince the narrator to join Russia, but rather to kill him. This allows the editor to revise the last sentence of the summary to accurately reflect the brother's true intentions without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 910/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator is at an airport in Crimea. His brother has a gun to his head that he's threatening to shoot. A conflict from when they were both in the military many years before is mentioned. The conflict didn't change a lot or result in much tangible gain, but people are still divided on it. The brother is a nationalist who opposed the war and is from Russia, while the narrator is an American.

**Critique**: The last sentence is incorrect. They are both Americans, and they fought together for the US Army, but the narrator's fellow soldier defected to Russia.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It corrects the factual inaccuracies in the last sentence by stating that both individuals are Americans who fought for the US Army, and clarifies that the narrator's fellow soldier defected to Russia. This information allows the editor to revise the last sentence to accurately reflect the characters' nationalities and military affiliations without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 911/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The time period of the story is undefined, although it seems as if it is set sometime in the present, or after Sept. 11th, 2001. The relation between the protagonist and the person with the gun is that they both used to be part of the same military company. The conflict in the story appears to be Crimea, although this information isn't mentioned. The protagonist's point of view seems marginalized, as he feels unworthy of his brothers' acknowledgement.

**Critique**: The conflict in question is the Crimean Conflict, and it is in fact clearly mentioned.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the conflict is the Crimean Conflict and that it is clearly mentioned in the source material. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the statement that the conflict "appears to be Crimea" and that it "isn't mentioned." The improved answer can explicitly state that the conflict is the Crimean Conflict and that it is mentioned in the story.

**Critique**: The narrator is at a Crimean airport, not traveling to Crimea.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer.

His militia pleads to the soldier that he cannot divulge his reasons for needing to go home, and no one in his country needs to know the horrors that he has seen and experienced.

**Critique**: The answer is very confusing and completely misses the points of the story and the events. It needs a complete overhaul.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the entire answer is confusing and misses the main points of the story, suggesting that a complete overhaul is necessary.

**Critique**: The answer is actually a series of options to choose from, which was not the purpose of the task.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer is structured as multiple-choice options, which is not suitable for the question asked. This implies that the answer should be a single, cohesive statement rather than a list of options. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by selecting the correct option and rewriting it as a complete sentence. Based on common knowledge, the correct answer is that "Better Call Saul" is a television series on AMC that follows New Mexico lawyer, Jimmy McGill. Therefore, I can rewrite the answer as: "Better Call Saul is a television series on AMC that follows New Mexico lawyer, Jimmy McGill."

**Question**: What is Better Call Saul?

**Answer**: A television series aired on AMC that has just been renewed for a fourth season. The series seems to be about a lawyer named Jimmy McGill who takes on a second identity or persona know as Saul Goodman, who is the go-to attorney of the criminal underworld. It also seems to have a narrative tie-in with another show, Breaking Bad.

**Critique**: The last sentence could be clearer, since it is stated in the text that Better Call Saul is a prequel to Breaking Bad.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the clarity of the last sentence in the answer. It suggests that the narrative tie-in with Breaking Bad should be explicitly stated as a prequel relationship. Therefore, the answer can be improved by revising the last sentence to clearly state that Better Call Saul is a prequel to Breaking Bad.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that there is no answer provided. As an editor, I cannot improve or create an answer without any information about "Better Call Saul" from the source material.

**Question**: What will the 4th season show? 

**Answer**: That it is a documentary about Jimmy's tale, going from a shyster lawyer to a reckless criminal mastermind with a lifestyle to match.

**Critique**: The word 'documentary' could be a bit misleading.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the word "documentary" might not accurately describe the nature of the show. This implies that the show is not a documentary, and the term should be replaced with a more appropriate descriptor. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by removing or replacing the word "documentary" with a term that better fits the context, such as "series" or "drama," depending on the nature of the show.

### Sample 931/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: What is a Network-Sanctioned Spoiler?

**Answer**: According to the announcement, a network-sanctioned spoiler is related to what was revealed last season on _Better Call Saul_: Jimmy's brother Chuck died in a tragic house fire.

**Critique**: The answer seems to only relate to the show in question, while the question seems more general.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer is too specific to a particular show, while the question is asking for a more general definition of a "Network-Sanctioned Spoiler." However, the critique does not provide any information or implications about what a general definition might be. Without additional information or guidance on what constitutes a network-sanctioned spoiler in a broader context, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material or having more context about the term.

### Sample 933/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: This season, in the wake of Chuck's death, Jimmy McGill seeks to change his life and becomes Saul Goodman. As he does so, everything from his legal practice and relationship to his acumen are put in jeopardy. Chuck’s death also upends his relationship with Kim Wexler as each person takes a different perspective on the affair. In the meantime, Gus Fring’s endgame disintegrates as the cartel goes into chaos and Nacho Varga clashes with greater forces.

**Critique**: Chuck's death affects Kim and Howard, which I believe the third sentence is about.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that Chuck's death affects both Kim and Howard, implying that the current answer should mention Howard's involvement or perspective as well. However, the critique does not provide specific information about how Howard is affected or what his perspective is. Without additional details, it is not possible to concretely improve the answer to include Howard's role or perspective without referring back to the source material.

However, the critique does not provide any specific information about the show or its renewal that could be used to improve the answer. Without knowing which show is being referred to or any details about its renewal, I cannot write a better answer.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the date of the report is not mentioned in the original text, but the answer already includes a date ("Thurs. 9/6").

### Sample 946/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: In Amazon's upcoming Lord of the Rings series, Will Poulter will play one of the leading roles. The young actor managed to snatch one of the most coveted positions for young actors. The specifics of the role aren't disclosed.  The series is being developed by the writing team of JD Payne and Patrick McKay. The only information about its plot is that it will take place in the Second Age of Tolkien mythology and explore stories before The Fellowship of the Ring.

**Critique**: The mention that the role is coveted is not necessary to summarize.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the mention of the role being "coveted" is unnecessary for the summary.

### Sample 947/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Will Poulter has been cast in one of the lead roles of an upcoming Lord of the Rings TV series produced by Amazon. The series is likely to be an origin story of J. R. R Tolkien's classic novels. The only information available about the plot is that it will explore a new story of Middle Earth preceding "The Fellowship of the Ring".

The series is being developed by the writing team of J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay, and it is also set to be directed by J. A. Bayona. Little is known about the plot of the series other than it will explore new storylines preceding J. R. R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring.

**Critique**: Poulter's previous roles do not need to be mentioned (especially considering the phrasing of the line in this summary is vague).

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on what to remove from the answer, namely the mention of Will Poulter's previous roles. This allows for a concrete improvement to the summary by eliminating the unnecessary information about his past work, which is not directly relevant to the summary of the Amazon's Lord of the Rings series.

Chaos ensues in the formerly peaceful town and people are being killed left and right by Jazhira and Gavin. The decision to leave the party was a mistake that will now come to haunt everyone.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the article did not mention Al Hussein's post or position and that he was not chosen to investigate human rights violations in Yemen. However, it does not provide any information on what Al Hussein's actual role or position is, nor does it suggest who was chosen for the investigation.

### Sample 1024/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is the neighbour shovelling?

**Answer**: She is shoveling a sidewalk that has no snow on it, and she talks about a storm.

**Critique**: She is doing these things, but she insists there was a storm, and the narrator doesn't find out why she believes this when they can see nothing indicative of a storm. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides additional context about the neighbor's actions and beliefs, specifically that she insists there was a storm despite there being no visible evidence of one. This implies that the answer should focus on the neighbor's insistence on the storm rather than just stating her actions. Therefore, the answer can be improved by incorporating this information to reflect the neighbor's belief in the storm, even though the narrator sees no evidence of it.

### Sample 1025/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is the neighbour shovelling?

**Answer**: It seems weird it would be shovelling for no reason like there was never any snow.

**Critique**: I agree, and I think she might be shoveling because there is actually snow, and the narrator just isn't seeing it.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests a reason for the neighbor's shoveling, which is that there might actually be snow, and the narrator is simply not perceiving it. This provides a specific direction to improve the answer by incorporating the possibility of snow being present, which the narrator might be unaware of. Therefore, the critique gives enough information to revise the answer to include this potential explanation.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 1026/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is the neighbour shovelling?

**Answer**: The neighbour is shovelling because there is snow on the ground, despite there being no snowstorm. Although the rest of the world has changed, the grass and the ground are the same, suggesting that everything has changed for the worse. The neighbour is just trying to adjust to this new reality.

**Critique**: I don't think this is a bad or feebly-constructed interpretation, but I think that, given the information indicating the narrator is hallucinating or something similar, we can assume maybe the narrator is wrong about their being no storm and no snow.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the narrator might be hallucinating, which implies that the statement about there being no snowstorm might be incorrect. However, it does not provide specific information on how to adjust the answer to reflect this possibility. The critique does not offer a clear alternative explanation or specific details that can be used to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

**Critique**: I don't think this is a bad or feebly-constructed interpretation, but I think that, given the information indicating the narrator is hallucinating or something similar, we can assume maybe the narrator is wrong about their being no storm and no snow.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the narrator might be hallucinating, which implies that the statement about there being no snow might be incorrect. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by suggesting that the neighbor is shoveling because there is actually snow, contrary to the narrator's perception. The critique provides enough information to adjust the interpretation of the situation without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1028/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~13 sentence summary.

**Answer**: I open the door and examine the interior of my house. My parents are gone. They've left everything behind. 
As I take the first step down, my mother's voice yells "Stop!". I cringe. It was all in my head. There was no one there except me.
The door to the living room was broken and I'd ripped off one of the hinges trying to get out. The front door opens. I enter the living room and find myself completely alone. This is beyond strange.

There was no one anywhere in town. I'd left my house and walked down the street. I passed the "heaven's little closet" store. It was once a pizza place called "little pieces of heaven". The owner ignored me because on the other side of the street was the bus station and the bus I'd taken had taken me away.

**Critique**: This should be written in the third person as you're talking about the text-not as someone in the text.

**Rationale**: The critique provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by changing the narrative perspective from first person to third person. This implies that the entire summary should be rewritten to reflect an external viewpoint rather than a personal account. For example, "I open the door" would become "He/She/They open the door," and so on throughout the text. This is a specific and actionable change that can be made without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: It means app developers and service providers only have abilities users are giving them to use.

**Critique**: No, it helps users by not stealing their data

**Rationale**: The critique provides a contrasting explanation to the current answer, suggesting that the primary benefit of radial decision making is related to data privacy rather than the abilities granted to app developers and service providers. This implies that the answer should focus on how radial decision making protects user data. Therefore, I can improve the answer by emphasizing the data protection aspect without needing to refer back to the source material.

Why does this radial decision making make such a big difference?

**Answer**: When they offer tokens rather than an email address it prevents other companies from using it for profit by selling or sharing it.

**Critique**: No it helps users by not removing their data

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is incorrect but does not provide enough information to correct it. It mentions that the decision helps users by not removing their data, but it does not explain how this relates to the concept of radial decision making or why it makes a big difference. Without additional context or details, it is not possible to improve the answer based solely on the critique provided.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Will Apple be able to shift the locus of control?

**Answer**: Yes, Apple seems likely to be able to change the locus of control for user privacy, both in terms of third-parties using its ecosystem and also for its own user data. The new single sign-on service, as well as the HomeKit adjustments for security cameras and location use, all indicate that Apple is intending to increasingly shift the control over privacy from providers to consumers themselves.

**Critique**: It's not clear at this stage

**Rationale**: The critique states, "It's not clear at this stage," which indicates that the answer's certainty about Apple's ability to shift the locus of control is questionable. However, the critique does not provide any specific information or alternative perspective that would allow for a concrete improvement to the answer. It does not suggest what might be unclear or provide any details that could be used to adjust the answer.

**Answer**: According to the passage, art critics believe the statue of Christopher Columbus is "inferior" and "unremarkable" because it is described as "inferior" and "unremarkable" by art critics.

**Critique**: Circular, vacuous answer

**Rationale**: The critique identifies that the answer is circular and vacuous, meaning it doesn't provide any substantive reasoning or evidence for why art critics think the statue is inferior. However, the critique does not provide any specific information or suggestions on how to improve the answer. It simply points out the flaw without offering a direction for improvement.

Who is William Abbot?

**Answer**: William Abbot is an English politician who served as a Member of Parliament for Melcombe Regis in 1437. He was a son of John Abbot and had two brothers who were also MPs.

**Critique**: The model uses the wrong use of verb here, 'William Abbot is an English politician...' The person being discussed is late.

**Rationale**: The critique points out a specific issue with the verb tense used in the answer, indicating that the present tense "is" should be changed to the past tense "was" because William Abbot is no longer alive. This provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the verb tense without needing to refer back to the source material.

What were Democrats' and Republicans' reactions to Trump’s first State of the Union address as president?  

**Answer**: The Congressional Black Caucus laughed when Trump touted the African-American unemployment rate. The Senate Majority Leader noted Trump giving his speech on the wages he’s offering to the American people “while he robs them blind,” referring to the low wages and high cost of living. While some parts of Trump’s speech received praise, many attendees viewed the speech as hyperbolic. The White House was adamant on claiming the ratings of Trump’s State of the Union address was the highest in history.

**Critique**: The response should include that Democrats resisted applause on many occasions.

This is a concrete improvement that can be made based on the critique alone.

### Sample 1093/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~2 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The article discusses the spread of the COVID-19 virus in Canada and the precautions being taken to prevent its spread. The article also discusses the precautions being taken by Queen's University and Kingston Police to prevent the spread of the virus.

**Critique**: The first sentence is redundant, and the article is more about the virus in the University area than Canada as a whole. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer. It suggests that the first sentence is redundant, which implies that it should be removed or rephrased to avoid repetition. Additionally, the critique indicates that the focus of the article is more on the University area rather than Canada as a whole, suggesting that the summary should emphasize the local context rather than a national one. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1094/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What did White house press secretary, Stephanie Grisham have to say about John Kelly?

**Answer**: Grisham said that Kelly never said that and that if he had, she would have thrown him out of the office because he wanted to "come back into the action like everybody else does."

**Critique**: No-Trump said that.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the statement attributed to Grisham was actually said by Trump. However, it does not provide any information about what Grisham actually said. Without knowing Grisham's actual statement, I cannot improve the answer. The critique only points out an error but does not provide the correct information needed to revise the answer.

### Sample 1095/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What did White house press secretary, Stephanie Grisham have to say about John Kelly?

**Answer**: Grisham said that Kelly never said that, and if he had said anything like that, Trump would have thrown him out of the office.

**Critique**: No-Trump said this quote, not Grisham. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the quote attributed to Grisham was actually said by Trump. This provides enough information to correct the attribution in the answer. The editor can revise the answer to accurately reflect that Trump, not Grisham, made the statement. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it allows for a specific correction to be made without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1096/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How would Trump not have been in the middle of an impeachment inquiry?

**Answer**: According to John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff, the Trump administration could have averted the current probe into the president by having better advising and guidance in place.

**Critique**: This is correct, but perhaps more accurately, Kelly says he could have prevented all this. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific suggestion that implies a more accurate phrasing of the answer. It suggests that John Kelly claimed he personally could have prevented the impeachment inquiry, rather than just implying that better advising and guidance in general could have done so. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by attributing the prevention directly to Kelly's potential actions.

### Sample 1097/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How would Trump not have been in the middle of an impeachment inquiry?

**Answer**: The statement from Kelly implies White House advisers could have prevented it.

**Critique**: This is accurate, but a partial answer, because Kelly thinks his presence and employ could have prevented it. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides additional information that can be used to improve the answer. It specifies that Kelly believes his presence and employment could have prevented the impeachment inquiry. This allows for a more complete answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The improved answer could incorporate this detail by stating that Kelly thinks his presence and employ could have prevented the impeachment inquiry, in addition to the implication about White House advisers.

### Sample 1098/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How would Trump not have been in the middle of an impeachment inquiry?

**Answer**: Kelly implied the Trump administration would not be in the midst of an impeachment inquiry if someone who told the truth were advising him. Presumably, Trump would not be in the middle of an impeachment inquiry if someone advising him told him not to do anything to violate the law.

**Critique**: This is a lot of words to say the not-quite-right thing. Kelly thinks he himself could have stopped this all.

**Rationale**: The critique implies that the answer should focus on Kelly's belief that he personally could have prevented the impeachment inquiry. It suggests that the current answer is too verbose and not entirely accurate in capturing Kelly's perspective. Using the critique, I can improve the answer by directly stating that Kelly believes his own involvement could have prevented the situation, without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 1099/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How would Trump not have been in the middle of an impeachment inquiry?

**Answer**: Kelly suggests it was because Trump was surrounded by staff members who would not tell him the truth.

**Critique**: Yes, but Kelly posits he himself could have prevented this.

**Rationale**: The critique provides additional information that can be used to improve the answer. It suggests that Kelly believes he personally could have prevented Trump from being in the middle of an impeachment inquiry. This implies that the answer should include Kelly's self-assessment of his potential role in preventing the situation. Therefore, the answer can be improved by adding this specific detail about Kelly's perspective.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who was crying?

**Answer**: The main character was crying.

**Critique**: Main character in this case is subjective as the narrator and the woman are both the main characters.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the term "main character" is subjective because both the narrator and the woman are considered main characters. However, it does not provide enough information to determine who was actually crying. Without additional context or information from the source material, it is not possible to improve the answer to specify who was crying. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

### Sample 1101/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who was crying?

**Answer**: The protagonist is crying.

**Critique**: Neither the narrator nor the woman has been assigned to a narrative role of a protagonist or antagonist. As such, the term protagonist can apply to either of the two characters.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the term "protagonist" is ambiguous because neither the narrator nor the woman has been clearly defined as the protagonist or antagonist. However, it does not provide enough information to determine who is actually crying. Without additional context or clarification from the source material, it is not possible to improve the answer to specify who was crying. The critique highlights an issue but does not offer a solution or imply a specific correction that can be made without consulting the source.

### Sample 1102/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who was crying?

**Answer**: The narrator's lover.

**Critique**: Lover is an interpretation of the role. She could be a wife, mistress, girlfriend, friend, etc. Even if a romantic relationship is somewhat implied, this is not confirmed.  

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the term "lover" is an interpretation and suggests that the relationship is not explicitly confirmed. However, it does not provide a specific alternative or confirm what the correct relationship is. Without additional information from the source material, it is not possible to determine the correct term to use for the relationship. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to improve the answer without needing to go back to the source material.

### Sample 1103/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who is the narrator?

**Answer**: The narrator does not have a name.

**Critique**: While the narrator is not named, identity can be defined by other factors such as their relation to the other character/s in a narrative, or the actions/roles they took in the story.


**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the narrator's identity can be defined by factors other than a name, such as their relationship to other characters or their actions/roles in the story. However, it does not provide specific information about what those relationships or actions/roles are. Without this specific information, I cannot concretely improve the answer to define the narrator's identity beyond stating that they do not have a name. Therefore, I would need to refer back to the source material to identify these other factors.

**Critique**: While the narrator is not named, identity can be defined by other factors such as their relation to the other character/s in a narrative, or the actions/roles they took in the story.


**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the narrator's identity can be inferred from their relationship to other characters or their actions/roles in the story. However, it does not provide specific details or examples of these relationships or actions. Without access to the source material, it is impossible to determine what these factors are and how they define the narrator's identity.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the narrator's identity can be inferred from their relationship to other characters or their actions/roles in the story. However, it does not provide specific details or examples of these relationships or actions. Without access to the source material, I cannot determine what these factors are or how they define the narrator's identity.

Was the narrator leaving her?

**Answer**: This information can't be found,but the story context doesn't indicate it.

**Critique**: Story clearly indicates: "I left." 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that directly contradicts the current answer. It states that the story clearly indicates "I left," which implies that the narrator did leave. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing it to reflect that the narrator did indeed leave, based on the information provided in the critique. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it provides enough information to improve the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1107/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What relationship did the narrator share with the lady?

**Answer**: They were having a romantic relationship

**Critique**: A romantic relationship is heavily implied but not distinctively stated. The answer must reflect that this is not a fact but a suggestion.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the romantic relationship is implied but not definitively stated, indicating that the answer should be adjusted to reflect this uncertainty. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can modify the answer to indicate that the romantic relationship is a possibility rather than a confirmed fact. For example, the answer could be revised to: "It is suggested that they may have been in a romantic relationship." This change aligns with the critique's implication that the relationship is not definitively stated.

### Sample 1108/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: A handsome narrator is speaking to a woman who is sitting with her back to him. He is trying to lie to her, but cannot keep a steady voice. She is asking him why he doesn't love her. Then she asks him what the illness is. 

He heads to the front door and is walking out but the woman angrily asks what it is that was wrong with them. He leaves.

**Critique**: Too many furbished details:
- narrator may or may not be handsome
- there is no indication that the narrator is trying to lie
- the woman only asks "why" but with no further context
- there is no mention of an illness
- the woman asks what is wrong with her 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific points that indicate inaccuracies in the current answer. It suggests that the details about the narrator being handsome, trying to lie, and the mention of an illness are not supported by the source material. Additionally, it clarifies that the woman only asks "why" without further context and questions what is wrong with her, not them. These points allow for concrete improvements to the answer by removing or correcting the inaccurate details and adjusting the dialogue to reflect the critique's information.

### Sample 1109/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator watches as a woman becomes overcome with despair and anger. The woman's questions about her identity leave the narrator at a loss for how to respond. The narrator leaves the room as the woman screams at them with regret and understanding.

**Critique**: Inconsistent information in the summary:
- her questions are not implied to be about identity
- in the end, the woman screams as she does not understand what is wrong with her

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific points of inconsistency in the summary. It clarifies that the woman's questions are not about identity and that her screaming is due to a lack of understanding about what is wrong with her. This information allows for concrete improvements to the summary by adjusting the description of the woman's questions and the reason for her screaming, without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1110/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The protagonist watches the person they love cry, and though they want to comfort them, they stay silent. The other person grows angrier and begins shouting. Finally, the protagonist leaves, not knowing why the other person is so heartbroken. This makes them realize the depth of not knowing where you are in the world, but they feel regret for leaving.

**Critique**: The story does not confirm if the narrator does not know why the woman was heartbroken -though it implies that the narrator is aware of the reason and this is why the narrator has decided to become strong in order to leave.

There is no regret in the narrator's feelings.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It implies that the narrator is aware of the reason for the other person's heartbreak and that the narrator's decision to leave is a conscious choice to become strong, rather than an act of regret. Therefore, the answer can be revised to reflect these insights without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1111/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Why is the story obsessed with gender?

**Answer**: This story takes place in a feminist paradigm. Gender is important to the characters who live in this society.

**Critique**: Not really a feminist paradigm per se, but after the Gender Wars, the government imposed that everyone must practice gender-neutrality. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the context of the story, namely that it is set after the Gender Wars and involves a government-imposed practice of gender-neutrality. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by replacing the vague "feminist paradigm" with the specific context of the Gender Wars and the government's role in enforcing gender-neutrality. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it provides enough information to improve the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: "The State of the Union" - remove "of the Union"

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on what to change in the answer by instructing to remove "of the Union" from "The State of the Union." This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique implies that the correct term should be "The State" instead of "The State of the Union," which can be directly applied to improve the answer.

### Sample 1119/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator is a doctor who has just finished checking the results of the couple's mandatory gen-pref tests. The couple did not want a male doctor for the procedure, and so the doctor was disappointed to learn that it was indeed a boy. However, after examining the fetus, the female partner starts to cry when she is told it is a boy, since the couple live in a part of the world where male children are considered undesirable.

**Critique**: "gen-pref" - chnage to "Gen-PreF"

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about a spelling or capitalization error in the term "gen-pref," suggesting it should be changed to "Gen-PreF."

**Critique**: Provide more context about the world the characters inhabit.

**Rationale**: The critique requests additional context about the world the characters inhabit, but it does not specify what kind of context or details are needed. Without specific information or implications about the world, it is impossible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the setting or societal norms that might be relevant.

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: A doctor that has undergone gender transition operations and alterations strives to enforce gender neutrality laws enacted after the gender wars. All sorts of gender neutral laws and customs are implied. When the patient is informed that their child is a boy, they're told the only option is termination because there are too many boys in their current sector. 

**Critique**: "When the patient is informed that their child is a boy, they're told the only option is termination because there are too many boys in their current sector." - lacks the proper transition of how the patient entered the story.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer lacks a transition explaining how the patient enters the story. However, it does not provide any specific information or suggestions on how to create this transition. Without additional details or context from the source material, it is not possible to improve the answer by adding the necessary transition.

**Answer**: The author of the passage is a doctor at an old-world hospital who encounters a patient couple looking to terminate their pregnancy because they already have too many male children. He breaks the news to them that the fetus is male, and they both cry at the news.

**Critique**: "a patient couple looking to terminate their pregnancy because they already have too many male children." and "they both cry at the news" - are highly inaccurate. Lacks one more sentence. The entire summary needs an overhaul.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that specific parts of the answer are "highly inaccurate" and suggests that the entire summary needs an overhaul. However, it does not provide any information on what the correct details should be or what the missing sentence should include.

**Answer**: This journal entry recounts a visit to see a pregnant couple in which the visiting doctor has to break the news that their child is male, meaning stricter government regulations will require that the pregnancy be terminated.

**Critique**: "the visiting doctor" - the doctor isn't visiting. The couple went to see him/her. The summary also has only one sentence. Needs a complete overhaul.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the doctor is not visiting the couple, but rather the couple went to see the doctor. This allows for a concrete improvement by correcting the context of the visit. However, the critique does not provide enough information to address the rest of the summary or to create a complete overhaul, as it does not specify what other details should be included or corrected.

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Taldi is a census town and a gram panchayat within the jurisdiction of the Canning police station in the Canning I CD block in the Canning subdivision of the South 24 Parganas district in the Indian state of West Bengal.

This implies that the answer should be adjusted to emphasize the apple fritter company rather than the fire. Therefore, I can improve the answer by shifting the focus from the fire to the apple fritter company, as suggested by the critique.

### Sample 1219/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Maximillian Garvey's wife and child had been killed in front of his eyes by The King's Ghost's Hand. Maximillian was already a genius, but the betrayal drove him into insanity. Now he was forced to flee to a new world where he could start afresh. He packed all his supplies and a vial of black liquid before stepping into the portal.

**Critique**: His child wasn't killed. Rather, he was taken by the King's guars to ensure Maximillian's good behavior.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It corrects the detail about Maximillian's child, stating that the child was not killed but taken by the King's guards. This allows for a concrete revision of the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The revised answer would involve changing the part about the child being killed to reflect that the child was taken instead.

### Sample 1220/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Maximillian Finds that he had been charged with treason by the king. When his wife and son were sentenced to death by the Reaper's Hand, Maximillian was in such a rage that he could recall every second of it. His son, Max, was taken away to insure his future behavior. He decided to escape to a new world, through a portal, with all his needs. He left and nobody ever saw him again.

**Critique**: His son isn't sentenced to death, only his wife.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It clearly states that only Maximillian's wife was sentenced to death, not his son. This allows for a concrete revision of the answer by correcting the part about the son's sentencing. The editor can change the sentence to reflect that only the wife was sentenced to death, while the son was taken away for a different reason.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 1221/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Maximillian Garvey faces down the executioners who arrive to kill him for treason. As Garvey shrieks in raw horror, he sees his wife, Jazira, and their son, Fangs, die in front of him. Weathered with guilt, Garvey decides to travel through a portal. He does a final check of his supplies and remembers that Fangs was taken by the king's guard to ensure his future good behavior. At this time, Garvey vanishes.

**Critique**: The name "Fangs" for Garvey's son is made up and does not appear in the source text.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the name "Fangs" is incorrect and does not appear in the source text. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing or correcting the name of Garvey's son without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique implies that the name should be changed to whatever is correct or simply removed if the correct name is not known.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 1222/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator finds a portal that will take them to a place that's free of the mad king they have been running from. Because of the crimes they've committed while trying to escape the king, they never want to see their child again. The narrator uses a concoction made of black stuff that's the size of a starless night before leaving with the supplies they have. Nothing is mentioned about their child after returning from the king.

**Critique**: It is not stated that Garvey enver wants to see his child again.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about Garvey never wanting to see his child again is incorrect. This implies that the sentence containing this information should be removed or corrected. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer by removing or altering the incorrect statement about Garvey's feelings towards his child. Therefore, the critique is constructive.

**Classification**: Constructive

### Sample 1223/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Maximillian Garvey's life falls apart when the King accuses him of treason punishable by death. Guards break into his home, murder his wife, and kidnap his son so he would behave. Maximillian lives a life devoid of life. He invents a portal that will transport him to a new world where he can escape his past and start over. No one ever sees him again, not even his son, who returns from a childhood spent as an adopted prince. 

**Critique**: The line "Maximillian lives a life devoid of life" is unclear and could better reflect his state of mind.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the phrase "Maximillian lives a life devoid of life" is unclear and suggests that it could better reflect his state of mind. This implies that the sentence should be revised to more accurately convey Maximillian's emotional or psychological condition. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can improve the answer by rephrasing the sentence to something like "Maximillian falls into a deep despair" or "Maximillian becomes emotionally numb," which would more clearly describe his state of mind.

**Critique**: The fact that the statue was installed in a Boston neighborhood is evidence against this answer.

**Rationale**: The critique provides evidence that contradicts the current answer by stating that the statue was installed in a Boston neighborhood, which implies that it was not transported to be re-sold. This suggests that the purpose of the transportation was likely for installation rather than resale. Therefore, the critique implies a correction to the answer by indicating the actual purpose of the transportation.

Tim Gurner, a luxury property developer in Australia, has also faced criticism for comments he made on 60 Minutes in Australia, implying that young people can't afford to buy property because they're wasting money on fancy toast and overpriced coffee.

**Critique**: " Tim Gurner, a luxury property developer in Australia, has also faced criticism for comments he made on 60 Minutes in Australia, implying that young people can't afford to buy property because they're wasting money on fancy toast and overpriced coffee." can be omitted since the question only asks who Jason Chaffetz is.

**Answer**: The woman is a cyborg.

**Critique**: There should be less certainty as we have evidence but no definitive answers.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the current answer is too definitive and implies that the answer should reflect uncertainty. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can adjust the answer to reflect this uncertainty by changing it to something like, "The woman might be a cyborg, but there is no definitive evidence." This adjustment aligns with the critique's suggestion to express less certainty.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who is the woman?

**Answer**: The woman is a cyborg just like the protagonist.

**Critique**: This could be accurate but we don't know so the language should be less certain.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the language in the answer should be less certain because the information about the woman being a cyborg is not confirmed. This implies that the answer should be rephrased to reflect uncertainty, such as using "might be" or "is possibly" instead of "is." Therefore, I can improve the answer by making it less definitive without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1348/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who is the woman?

**Answer**: The woman is a cyborg, created for warfare.

**Critique**: We don't know for certain so the language should be less certain.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the language in the answer should be less definitive because the certainty of the woman's identity as a cyborg is not confirmed. This implies that the answer should be modified to reflect uncertainty, such as changing "The woman is a cyborg" to "The woman might be a cyborg" or "The woman is believed to be a cyborg." This change can be made without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides clear guidance on how to adjust the language to reflect uncertainty.

### Sample 1349/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~1 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The protagonist is a male cyborg making love with a female cyborg during wartime, presumably in the future. 

**Critique**: We don't know the protagonist is male, or that either of them is a cyborg for sure.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the gender of the protagonist and the fact that they are cyborgs are not confirmed. This implies that the answer should be revised to remove these assumptions. Therefore, the improved answer would avoid specifying the protagonist's gender and the cyborg nature of the characters, focusing instead on the confirmed elements of the scenario, such as the setting being wartime and presumably in the future. This can be done without needing to refer back to the source material, as the critique provides enough guidance on what to change.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the story is not fragmented verse and that the answer does a poor job of identifying the narrator's voice. However, it does not provide any specific information or suggestions on how to accurately describe the narrator's voice or what the correct form of the story is. Without additional details or guidance, it is not possible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material to understand the correct form and voice of the narrator. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

### Sample 1395/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~6 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator persuades people to be wise about recycled pizza boxes. They say that because pizza boxes are made of corrugated cardboard, they are recyclable. The reason some pizza boxes are not recyclable is that the juicy toppings and cheese stick to the pizza box. Once they are caked with oil or grease, they are difficult to recycle.

Additionally, pizza boxes usually have moisture, which could harbor mold and bacteria if composted. One way to avoid such events is to ensure the pizza box is pest free. Properly disposing them will be helpful, too.

**Critique**: The oil is what causes problems when composting too, and "properly disposing them" is the subject of the article

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It indicates that oil is a problem not only for recycling but also for composting, which can be added to the explanation about why pizza boxes are difficult to compost. Additionally, the critique points out that "properly disposing them" is the subject of the article, suggesting that the answer should focus more on disposal methods. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by expanding on the issues with oil in composting and emphasizing disposal methods.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about Indonesia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), including its rank and the extent of its claim. However, it does not directly address what Indonesia is known for, as highlighted in the article. The critique introduces new information that could be relevant to the question, but without knowing how this relates to the original article's focus, it's unclear how to integrate this into the answer.

**Critique**: The question is specific in the information it wants, so only the part about the EEZ is needed.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that only the part about the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is needed to answer the question. This implies that the mention of "the island country" is unnecessary for the specific information the question seeks.

**Critique**: The question asks how many islands Indonesia has, not just the main islands. This also changes the context of "what are they called".

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer only addresses the main islands, while the question asks for the total number of islands in Indonesia. However, the critique does not provide the total number of islands or any additional names beyond the main ones. Therefore, without the source material, I cannot provide the total number of islands or a complete list of their names.

### Sample 1418/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~7 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Beatriz Morelos, a mother of four, was scheduled to be deported on Tuesday to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, which is in an area that the U.S. Department of State warns travelers to avoid “due to violent crime, including homicide, armed robbery, carjacking, extortion and sexual assault,” according to its website. Morelos’ husband, Jose DeJesus, said he feels his family’s worst nightmare has come true. Morelos, 33, was awaiting deportation at an ICE detention center in Tiffin, Ohio, as of Monday evening, but her attorney, Elizabeth Ford, said she is working to get the U.S. to rethink its decision. Ford said she is trying to get ICE to grant Morelos a stay, which she admits is difficult because of the way the country’s new immigration laws are written. “It is absolutely impossible for people in her situation and in many other people’s situations to correct their status with how the laws are written now,” Ford told WEWS on Monday. “If she was able to correct her status, she absolutely would have, just like many of the other people would.” Ford said that Morelos does not have a criminal history and that she would be separated from her four young children, who are U.S. citizens, and her husband, who’s in the U.S. on a visa. “I can’t imagine putting a mother, who’s in her mid-30s with four U.S. citizen children, there alone,” Ford told WEWS. “She has no family in Mexico. Her entire family is in the United States. It’s absolutely horrific to think that this is where this young woman is going.”

**Critique**: The summary feels more like a re-written report and could use some editing to reflect that it is a summary.

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: 125 Yemeni children dying per day in the Middle East is the newest and worst tragedy that has struck the region. The death toll is continuing to rise because of Saudi-led blockade.

50,000 children have died in 2017. The blockade on deliveries of aid by the Saudi-led coalition is preventing the transport of aid to the Yemenis.

Iran's supply of missiles to the Houthi-Saleh alliance is the reason given for the blockage, but the UN monitors said they have seen no evidence to support the claim.

The Trump administration has supplied the US-made munitions to the Saudis, and Yemenis have often found the remnants as well.

**Critique**: 130 not 125

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific correction to the number of Yemeni children dying per day, changing it from 125 to 130.

### Sample 1453/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Paul, who seems to be from a working-class background, is sitting in a laundromat that he describes in poor aesthetic condition. He seems ashamed as his daughter looks up at him, choosing not to check that his zipper is done up correctly. He flashes on an image of himself with a woman in bed, wet and slapping. She asks him what he likes, and before he has time to think about her question, he imagines himself back into his daydreams. After he leaves the restroom and his daughter, he sits down again with thoughts of the young woman with perfect breasts.

**Critique**: He actually checks his zipper which is now that he's ashamed of.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts the current answer, indicating that Paul does check his zipper, which is the source of his shame.

**Critique**: There's no evidence that suggests Paul hugging and kissing his daughter.

**Rationale**: The critique specifically points out that there is no evidence of Paul hugging and kissing his daughter.

His ex-wife shows up, smelling of smoke, and solicits the Armalite rifle, which the narrator uses to kill her and the lawyer in a rage. The narrator later discovers that the lawyer was delivering the key to the portal to Gretta, and kills him when the lawyer threatens him with a gun. The narrator explains that Jericho is actually the key to the portal and completes the deed by shooting the lawyer between the eyes.

**Critique**: It is incorrect that the lawyer knew about the portal.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the lawyer did not know about the portal, which directly contradicts a part of the current answer. This allows for a concrete improvement by removing or altering the part of the answer that states "the lawyer was delivering the key to the portal to Gretta" and "the lawyer threatens him with a gun" since these are based on the incorrect assumption that the lawyer knew about the portal. The rest of the answer can remain as is, or be adjusted to reflect the correct sequence of events without the lawyer's knowledge of the portal.

She announces she has claimed Jericho as her own and grabs him. The protagonist gets angry and shoots Gretta, killing her. The lawyer arrives and is shot by the protagonist, also dying. Jericho is the key to a portal to god-like powers.

**Critique**: "The protagonist gets angry and shoots Gretta, killing her. The lawyer arrives and is shot by the protagonist, also dying." This can be written as one sentence to fit the ~3 sentence summary.

**Rationale**: The critique provides a clear suggestion on how to improve the answer by combining two specific sentences into one.

**Critique**: It is incorrect that the lawyer is the narrator's.

**Critique**: The model's sentence is not well structured here, '...and his new book will be addressing what Democratic leaders initially drafted 10 articles...' is confusing. 

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the sentence structure is confusing, specifically the part about Mr. Eisen's new book. However, it does not provide specific guidance on how to restructure the sentence to improve clarity.

### Sample 1484/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe the "narrower case" and what makes it narrower.

**Answer**: House Democrats initially drafted 10 articles of impeachment against President Trump accusing him of a wide range of high crimes and misdemeanors. However, before the case went to trial, House Democratic leaders decided to narrow the focus to just Trump's campaign to pressure Ukraine to incriminate his Democratic rivals. This was done due to concern about lack of consensus among Democrats in conservative districts, and the fear that a more expansive case would be viewed as overreach. Thus, the narrower case pursued was based on abuse of power by enlisting a foreign power, obstruction of investigations, and obstruction of the Mueller inquiry.

**Critique**: The model does not make use of punctuations at the right angles in the answers here, '... against President Trump accusing him of a wide...' and here '...in conservative districts,...'


**Rationale**: The critique points out specific issues with punctuation in the answer, indicating where punctuation is missing or incorrect. This allows for a concrete improvement to be made to the answer by adjusting the punctuation in the specified locations. The critique provides enough information to make these changes without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Answer**: The narrower case was whittled down to Trump's interactions with Ukraine, according to Eisen's book.

**Critique**: The model does not describe what the narrower case is about. It does not directly answer the question asked.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer does not directly describe what the "narrower case" is about, which is a valid observation. However, it does not provide any specific information or implications about what the narrower case entails beyond mentioning Trump's interactions with Ukraine. Without additional details or guidance on what the narrower case specifically involves, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material. The critique fails to provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

### Sample 1486/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe the "narrower case" and what makes it narrower.

**Answer**: Mr. Nadler did not pursue all the articles against President Trump, but he still included some of them. The book says that Mr. Trump "obstructed Mr. Mueller's investigation, engaged in the hush money scheme carried out by Mr. Cohen, abused power, obscured the rule of law, and targeted his adversaries with the power of his office".

**Critique**: '...engaged in the hush money scheme carried out...' the model omits a hyphen in between hush money.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about a typographical error in the answer, specifically the omission of a hyphen in the phrase "hush money scheme." This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adding the hyphen, changing it to "hush-money scheme." No additional information from the source material is needed to make this correction.

### Sample 1487/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Describe the "narrower case" and what makes it narrower.

**Answer**: The narrower case implied charging Trump with obstruction of the Senate investigation into the pressure campaign against Ukraine, thereby smuggling in the unadded charges for all the other crimes President Trump committed too.

**Critique**: The model's answer fails to mention the initial ten articles gathered by House Democrats to impeach Trump and how it became a narrower case when the committee decided to cut it down to three.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what is missing from the answer, namely the initial ten articles gathered by House Democrats and the decision to narrow it down to three. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by including these details, which explain what makes the case narrower. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it provides enough information to enhance the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How did Trump obstruct Mueller's investigation?

**Answer**: The article that would have charged Trump with obstructing Mueller's investigation alleges that Trump endeavored to hinder or impede the special counsel's investigation, specifically by firing former FBI director James Comey and directing White House aides to lie to investigators, among other actions.

**Critique**: The model outsourced its answer.

**Rationale**: The critique "The model outsourced its answer" does not provide any specific information or guidance on how to improve the answer. It does not indicate what part of the answer is incorrect or lacking, nor does it suggest what should be included or changed. Without additional details or context, it is impossible to make a concrete improvement to the answer based solely on the critique.

However, the critique does not provide any information or implications about how Trump obstructed Mueller's investigation. It only questions the validity of the current answer without offering any details or corrections that could be used to improve the answer.

**Answer**: The Committee staff members drafted nine articles of impeachment against Trump including allegations that he obstructed Mueller's investigation. In the end, House Democrats decided to focus their impeachment efforts on Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine.

**Critique**: The model's answer does not directly answer the question. It's referring to the Trump impeachment process.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer does not directly address the question about how Trump obstructed Mueller's investigation, instead focusing on the impeachment process related to Ukraine. However, the critique does not provide any specific information or implications about how Trump obstructed Mueller's investigation. Without additional details or guidance on what the correct information should be, I cannot improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

### Sample 1495/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~2 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Former White House Ethics Counsel Norman L. Eisen details the decision made by House Democrats to pursue a narrower case against President Donald Trump, rather than including more allegations of high crimes and misdemeanors. House Democrats ultimately focused on Trump's interactions with Ukraine, rather than a broader case, reasoning that some Democrats in conservative districts would not support a kitchen-sink prosecution. Despite the narrower case, House Democrats won no Republicans in the Senate and only one in the House. Critics argue that Democrats mishandled the matter by focusing too narrowly on Ukraine.

**Critique**: The summary is over two sentences long, and the model uses inappropriate punctuation marks here, '...House Democrats ultimately focused on Trump's interactions with Ukraine, rather than...'

**Rationale**: The critique points out two issues: the summary exceeds the requested two sentences, and there is inappropriate punctuation. The first issue is clear and actionable: the summary needs to be condensed into two sentences. The second issue is less clear because it does not specify what is inappropriate about the punctuation or how to correct it. Without specific guidance on the punctuation, I cannot make a concrete improvement regarding that aspect without referring to the source material. However, I can address the sentence length issue by condensing the summary.

**Classification**: Non-Constructive

### Sample 1496/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~2 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Norm Eisen, who drafted the case for impeachment against President Trump, lists the raw account of the House Judiciary Committee rejecting to include more political objectives in the case as it could cost them the support of the Democrats. The Senate Democrats and House Democratic leaders thought that those would be too risky.

**Critique**: Why is the model shortening Norman Eisen's first name to 'Norm?'

**Rationale**: The critique questions the use of "Norm" instead of "Norman" for Eisen's first name. This implies that the correct name should be "Norman Eisen." Therefore, the answer can be improved by changing "Norm Eisen" to "Norman Eisen" without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique provides enough information to make this specific correction.

**Question**: Write a ~2 sentence summary.

**Answer**: This post reports about the House Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Congress approval to impeach Mr. Donald Trump in 2020. This was because the House democrat's thought President Trump was harming the country.

**Critique**: How was the president harming the country? The model does not detail the specifics as stated in the article.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the answer lacks specific details about how President Trump was allegedly harming the country, as mentioned in the article. However, it does not provide any information or implications about what those specifics might be. Without access to the source material, it is impossible to improve the answer by adding the necessary details about the alleged harm. Therefore, the critique does not provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

**Answer**: At the time of the document, Norm Eisen, a lawyer working with the House Democrats in the effort to impeach President Trump, was releasing a book that gives an inside account of the impeachment effort. The document discusses some of the claims inside the book.

**Critique**: The model shortens Norman Eisen's first name to 'Norm.'
'The document discusses some of the claims inside the book.' such as?

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the name "Norm" should be "Norman," which is a specific correction that can be made without needing to refer to the source material. However, the critique also asks for specifics about the claims discussed in the book, which requires information not provided in the critique. Therefore, while the name correction is constructive, the request for more details about the claims is non-constructive because it does not provide enough information to improve the answer without referring back to the source material.

### Sample 1499/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~2 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Essentially, House Democrats initially drafted 10 articles of impeachment against President Trump before narrowing their focus to his pressure on Ukraine to incriminate his Democratic rivals. They ended up choosing to focus on just that one article in order to reach bipartisan consensus, but some Democrats regret that decision now, as the case was weaker and didn't resonate with the public.

**Critique**: The model's sentence structure is flawed and slightly wordy here, 'Essentially...,' '...in order to...' and here, '...They ended up choosing...'

**Rationale**: The critique points out issues with sentence structure and wordiness but does not provide specific guidance on how to improve these aspects. Without specific suggestions or examples of how to rephrase the sentences, it is not possible to make concrete improvements to the answer without referring back to the source material or having additional context. The critique identifies a problem but does not imply a clear solution.

**Answer**: You are everywhere and in everything.

**Critique**: "You are everywhere and in everything." - change 2nd person writing (you) to 3rd person. A complete rewrite is needed for this to make sense.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by changing the perspective from second person ("you") to third person. This implies that the sentence should be rewritten to reflect a third-person perspective, such as "They are everywhere and in everything" or "It is everywhere and in everything." The critique does not require additional information from the source material to make this change, as it focuses on the grammatical perspective rather than the content itself.

This implies that the answer should reflect the idea of being less significant or less substantial than the wind. Without needing to refer back to the source material, I can rewrite the answer to align with this implication, such as "To be less than the wind."

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the event described in the answer is not about drowning a child but rather resembles a baptism. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the description of the event from "drown a child" to something more akin to a baptism. Therefore, the critique gives enough information to revise the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1510/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is the story obsessed with gender?

**Answer**: It is not clear why the story focuses on gender, but, because it was written by a PHD, it might have gotten too complicated for it to all be explained in the story form.

**Critique**: This story is a work of fiction. It wasn't really written by a PhD.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that corrects a factual inaccuracy in the answer. The answer incorrectly attributes the complexity of the story to it being written by a PhD, which the critique clarifies is not true. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by removing the incorrect attribution to a PhD.

### Sample 1511/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is the story obsessed with gender?

**Answer**: The story is interested in gender primarily because of the clinic's restrictions on cohabitation for partners and the resulting potential need for a termination. The doctor is consistently oriented toward gender throughout the journal entry, in an effort to make sure that the criteria for cohabitation is being observed.

**Critique**: This is not the reason the story is "obsessed" with gender. The story doesn't surround a cohabitation issue. The story takes place in a gender-obsessed future/utopia.

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific reason for the story's obsession with gender, stating that it takes place in a "gender-obsessed future/utopia." This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by replacing the incorrect explanation with the one provided in the critique.

### Sample 1513/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is the story obsessed with gender?

**Answer**: The story is obsessed with gender because both the male and female patient worry endlessly about how their genders will affect their interactions with the doctor. The author was disappointed to find a male would be attending the appointment and is focused most strongly on the male patient. Their attempts to sculpt their appearances to be visually kei is reminiscent of early norms of gender adhering which suggests the author has an outdated perspective on gender. The author also focuses on how all aspects of the patient's relationship and lives must adhere to specific criteria or there will be sanctions from the State.

**Critique**: Only the final sentence sort of states why the story is obsessed with gender. The story takes place in a gender-obsessed future/utopia.

**Rationale**: The critique provides a specific reason for the story's obsession with gender, stating that it takes place in a "gender-obsessed future/utopia." This information allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by incorporating this context into the explanation.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What is the narrator's gender?

**Answer**: The narrator's gender is female. The protagonist announces herself as "Mystr S., PHD," and has gone through various physical changes in order to present as male. Despite the protagonist's presentation, the male partner is able to figure out the protagonist's true gender based on various cues. Ultimately, the protagonist tells the couple that the fetus is male and offers them the option to terminate the pregnancy.

**Critique**: The man doesn't really figure out the protagonist's true gender. This should be omitted. Protagonist is also not clear when "narrator" is also being used, perhaps interchangeably. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on what to change in the answer. It indicates that the part about the man figuring out the protagonist's true gender should be omitted, which is a clear instruction for improvement. Additionally, the critique points out a potential confusion between the terms "protagonist" and "narrator," suggesting that the answer should clarify or consistently use these terms.

**Critique**: The tone of the article seems overall to be neutral, so the line about the author's opinion on the practice seems fabricated.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the statement about the author's opinion being controversial and inhumane is not supported by the tone of the article, which is described as neutral.

### Sample 1569/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~2 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Michigan has become the first state to ban the National Security Agency's intrusive data collection practices, by passing a law that prohibits law enforcement and state agencies from turning over personal data to the federal government without due process. The use of warrantless data against Americans has been illegal since June of 2015 however, the law has still been well upheld.

**Critique**: "While the NSA’s warrantless data collection was ruled illegal by a court in June 2015, it has continued and the government has attempted to cover up its illegal actions by writing them into law" implies that the law hasn't necessarily been upheld.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that contradicts the current answer's claim about the law being upheld. It implies that the NSA's warrantless data collection has continued despite being ruled illegal, and that the government has attempted to legitimize these actions through legislation.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Summarize the plot of The Body.

**Answer**: The body of Maya Verma, a powerful businesswoman who died of a heart attack, has disappeared from the morgue. Ajay Puri, the husband of Maya and owner of a lab, is called in for investigation and is seen as a suspect. Strange incidents start happening to Ajay, including that Maya's dead body reappears and Ajay starts to suspect that she is trying to exact revenge on him. In flashbacks, it is revealed that Ajay killed Maya and disguised it as a heart attack using a cardiotoxin. Ajay confesses this to SP Jairaj, and when SP orders the police to arrest Ajay, Ajay falls down in chest pain and is revealed to be Ritu, the daughter of SP Jairaj. The plot of the film is thus ultimately about a revenge plan hatched by Ajay and Ritu against Maya.

**Critique**: Ajay isn't Ritu as the second to the last sentence of the answer claims. The sentence is also a bit unclear. 

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that Ajay is not Ritu, which directly addresses an inaccuracy in the answer.

**Answer**: The Body is a 2019 Indian Hindi-language film. The "game" that the film's protagonist finds himself trapped in with Maya, who is dead, is a ploy crafted by the film's producers, utilizing the death of Rishi Kapoor's character, SP Jairaj Rawal, after which the character is still alive.

**Critique**: There is no mention of SP Jairaj's death in the passage.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the mention of SP Jairaj's death is incorrect. This implies that the part of the answer discussing SP Jairaj's death should be removed or corrected.

### Sample 1594/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The Body is a suspense thriller film about a dead businesswoman, Maya, who vanishes from the morgue before autopsy. Her husband Ajay is suspected for her murder and must stay in the morgue until her body is found. Maya begins to haunt him and a plan is revealed that Ajay and Ritu worked together to kill Maya; her daughter Isha is revealed to be SP Jairaj's daughter. At the end, Ajay learns that he is being poisoned with the same cardiotoxin used to kill Maya and was part of a plot by Isha with her father, SP Jairaj.

**Critique**: "revealed that Ajay and Ritu worked together to kill Maya; her daughter Isha is revealed to be SP Jairaj's daughter." This sentence is unclear as it refers to Isha as Maya and SP Jairag's daughter.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the sentence is unclear because it mistakenly refers to Isha as Maya and SP Jairaj's daughter. This implies that the sentence should be clarified to accurately reflect the relationships between the characters. Without needing to refer back to the source material, the editor can improve the answer by rephrasing the sentence to correctly identify the relationships, such as stating that Isha is SP Jairaj's daughter, without implying she is Maya's daughter.

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The writer of this piece explains that there is in fact an exception to the reliable rule of Pi (the mathematical formula that describes the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle). This exception is found in the '4 units system', when inverted with the 'no complications equation'. Whilst happily concluding that this system does not disprove Pi, the writer notes that it will leave the headstrong physicist questioning their 'chaos theory' endeavors.

**Critique**: The explanation was done by the older peer, not the writer of this piece.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer. It clarifies that the explanation was given by an older peer, not the writer of the piece.

### Sample 1630/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The author discusses the history of Pi - a formula that mathematicians have long considered a fundamental principle. However, he shares the story of one such mathematician who dedicated years of his life seeking to refute Pi, only to come up empty-handed. In the end, the scientist's elderly colleague points out that there is an exception to Pi - the "No Pi 4u" formula.

**Critique**: It omits mentioning that the mathematicians were early pioneers like the Sumerians and Greeks.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the answer should include information about the early pioneers of mathematics, such as the Sumerians and Greeks. This provides enough information to improve the answer by adding a sentence or two about these early mathematicians and their contributions to the history of Pi. Therefore, the critique is constructive because it gives a clear direction on how to enhance the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1631/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator presents an argument against the commonly accepted belief that Pi is a universally accurate ratio that can be applied to all circles. The essay specifically mentions one individual's attempt to disprove this theory after unsuccessfully trying for many years, only to be informed by a more experienced physicist that a different formula is in fact accurate. In short, that formula is "No more Pi 4u", and it appears to be more accurate than Pi.

**Critique**: "In short, that formula is "No more Pi 4u", and it appears to be more accurate than Pi" is misrepresented. It is not a 'more accurate formula', but a no-complication equation that the elder peer gave to the young man in a way to tell him to bring his life's work to an and.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about the misrepresentation in the answer. It clarifies that "No more Pi 4u" is not a more accurate formula but rather a dismissive statement from the elder peer to the young man.

Overall, patches for these vulnerabilities have been marked by significant technical difficulties." - the question is not open-ended and a simple answer would suffice, making this section optional. Can be deleted.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests that the detailed explanation provided in the answer is optional and that a simple answer would suffice. However, it does not specify what the simple answer should be. The critique implies that the detailed information can be removed, but it does not provide enough information to determine what a concise, sufficient answer would be.

**Rationale**: The critique questions the basis of the answer by pointing out that the information about Avis Little Eagle not having children is not stated in the text. However, it does not provide any alternative information or suggest what the correct answer might be. Without additional information or a suggestion of what is correct, I cannot improve the answer. I would need to refer back to the source material to verify or correct the statement about Avis Little Eagle's children.

**Question**: Why did the UN indefinitely postpone the presentation?

**Answer**: They wanted all references to the suppression of press freedoms in Turkey removed to raise the question "What do you do when one of the founders of UNAOC demands you to edit your press freedoms presentation."

**Critique**: The postponement wasn't done to raise any question. The quote is made up as well.

**Question**: How is the media suppressed in Turkey?

**Answer**: The media is suppressed by throwing hundreds of journalists in jail and trying to export its suppressions elsewhere.

**Critique**: The media isn't suppressed in Turkey by suppressing it elsewhere.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about exporting suppressions elsewhere is incorrect. This implies that the part of the answer stating "trying to export its suppressions elsewhere" should be removed or corrected. The critique provides enough information to make a concrete improvement by removing the incorrect part of the answer, focusing only on the accurate part about journalists being jailed.

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: World Press Freedom Day, a day created by the UN to celebrate press freedom. The News Literacy Project was putting forth a presentation at the UN's Alliance of Civilisations to celebrate the same. But, just before the event, the UN said they would postpone the presentation indefinitely if NLP did not remove a part of the presentation related to press suppression in Turkey.

This shows the hypocrisy of the UN. And not only that but by doing so, instead of suppressing the topic it got a lot more attention.

**Critique**: "Alliance of Civilizations" is misspelled.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about a spelling error in the answer. With this information, I can correct the spelling of "Alliance of Civilisations" to "Alliance of Civilizations" without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The News Literacy Project was set to give a presentation on World Press Freedom Day at the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, but the Alliance cancelled the presentation unless references to Turkey's press freedom suppression were removed. The cancellation has instead put focus on Turkey's recent suppression of press freedom, in light of the UN's reluctance to openly address it. Nonetheless, donations to the News Literacy Project help ensure they can continue creating resources for students interested in news literacy.

**Critique**: The donations part is part of the meta-content, not the article. It should be removed.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the part about donations is not relevant to the article's content and should be removed. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by eliminating the irrelevant information about donations. Therefore, the critique allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: A non-profit organization dedicated to increasing news literacy in students had planned a presentation to commemorate World Press Freedom day, but found out just before that the event had been unexpectedly canceled by the UNAOC unless any references to press restrictions in Turkey were removed. It seems that in trying to suppress discussion, the UNAOC succeeded only in creating more attention towards the dangers of suppressing press freedoms in Turkey.

**Critique**: The suppression drew attention to the press freedoms in Turkey, not to the dangers of it.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what is incorrect in the answer. It clarifies that the attention was drawn to "press freedoms in Turkey" rather than "the dangers of suppressing press freedoms in Turkey." This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adjusting the phrasing to accurately reflect the critique's point.

**Question**: Write a ~5 sentence summary.

**Answer**: A group called The News Literacy Project was set to present at the UN Alliance of Civilizations on World Press Freedom Day, but the group was told their presentation was "indefinitely postponed" due to references to the press suppression in Turkey. The UN's actions appeared to unintentionally draw attention to the suppression of press freedoms in Turkey, which has a reputation for doing so. Supporters of The News Literacy Project can choose to support the group financially to keep it running.

**Critique**: The support part doesn't belong to the article's content.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the part about supporting The News Literacy Project financially is not relevant to the article's content.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What are Federal Reserve officials baffled about?

**Answer**: Federal Reserve officials are baffled about why average US workers have not seen a rise in wages despite a historically low unemployment rate. The paper argues that there is more labor slack in the job market than is suggested by the official data, due to under-employment and weak bargaining power for workers.

**Critique**: The second sentence is irrelevant to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the second sentence is irrelevant to the question, which is about what Federal Reserve officials are baffled about. The first sentence directly addresses the question by stating that officials are baffled about the lack of wage increases despite low unemployment. The critique implies that removing the second sentence, which discusses labor slack and bargaining power, would improve the answer by making it more focused on the question. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the second sentence without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the recovery model mentioned in the answer is not in the article and is irrelevant to the question. However, it does not provide any information about what the expectations by the Fed actually were. Without knowing what the correct expectations are, I cannot improve the answer.

### Sample 1691/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

What were the expectations by the Fed?

**Answer**: The Fed has been baffled by the lack of wage growth despite a historically low unemployment rate. Researchers find that the official number of unemployed fails to capture the reality of the job market, namely the impact of underemployment that affects worker bargaining power. The Fed's decision to raise interest rates is believed to be based on a misunderstanding of the labor market and risks stunting the recovery.

**Critique**: The sentence about raising interest rates is irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the sentence about raising interest rates is irrelevant. This provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by removing that specific sentence. The critique does not require additional information from the source material to make this change, as it directly identifies which part of the answer should be altered.

What were the expectations by the Fed?

**Answer**: The expectations by the Fed are that wage growth should be high given the low unemployment rate. However, the paper argues that there is more slack in the job market than the Fed thinks, which leads to stagnant wage growth. In addition, rising inflation rates are beginning to erode wage gains.

**Critique**: The sentence about raising interest rates is irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique mentions a sentence about raising interest rates being irrelevant, but the provided answer does not contain any mention of raising interest rates. Without additional context or information from the source material, it is unclear which part of the answer the critique is referring to.

However, the critique does not provide the correct information about who Jerome Powell is or what his current position is.

**Answer**: Nearly 10% to 3.9%.

**Critique**: The joblessness rate fell from 10% to 3.9%, not by 10% as the answer implies.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that corrects the misunderstanding in the answer. It clarifies that the joblessness rate fell from 10% to 3.9%, rather than falling by 10%. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adjusting the wording to accurately reflect the change in the jobless rate.

**Answer**: It has fallen drastically to 3.9% (a year before, it was 10%).

**Critique**: The article never said that 10% unemployment figure was from the previous year.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement about the 10% unemployment figure being from the previous year is incorrect. However, it does not provide the correct timeframe for the 10% figure. Without knowing the correct timeframe, I cannot accurately revise the answer to reflect the true context of the 10% figure.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

How much of the US jobless rate fallen?

**Answer**: The US jobless rate has fallen sharply from 10% to 3.9% last month.

**Critique**: The wording of the answer implies that unemployment fell in a single month, which is not true.

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the wording of the answer is misleading because it suggests that the unemployment rate fell from 10% to 3.9% in a single month. This implies that the answer should be rephrased to accurately reflect the timeline of the decrease in the jobless rate. Without needing to refer to the source material, the editor can improve the answer by rewording it to indicate that the decrease occurred over a longer period, rather than in a single month. For example, the answer could be revised to: "The US jobless rate has fallen sharply over time, reaching 3.9% last month from a previous high of 10%."

### Sample 1699/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~2 sentence summary.

**Answer**: A new paper has presented a compelling explanation for why wages are not rising amid a historically-low unemployment rate. The paper argues that underemployment, which includes involuntary part-time work and job creation in low-wage industries, is preventing workers from having the requisite bargaining power to ask for raises. While the headline unemployment figure is low, these measures fail to capture the true extent of joblessness. More Fed rate hikes could be premature and crimp the recovery.

**Critique**: The question asks for a two-sentence summary. The last two sentences can be removed.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by indicating that the last two sentences should be removed to meet the requirement of a two-sentence summary. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. By removing the last two sentences, the answer will be concise and adhere to the question's requirement.

**Critique**: The answer is completely made up and irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is "completely made up and irrelevant," but it does not provide any information on what the correct or relevant content should be. Without specific guidance or details on what the summary should include, it is impossible to improve the answer without referring back to the source material. The critique fails to provide enough information to make a concrete improvement to the answer.

### Sample 1701/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~2 sentence summary.

**Answer**: According to a new paper, increasing labor "slack" due to underemployment and weak bargaining power is skewing wage growth lower than expected, leaving workers in a poor position to bargain for raises. Fed Chairman Powell had been baffled by the lack of wage growth, but the authors of the paper suggest this is no surprise due to the lack of bargaining power of workers. The authors caution that raising rates prematurely may further constrain growth.

**Critique**: The answer repeats the low bargaining power of workers. The answer should remove that and combine the last sentence into the previous one so that it's both non-redundant and has two sentences as the question asks.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by removing the redundant mention of low bargaining power and combining the last sentence with the previous one to meet the requirement of a two-sentence summary. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

The phenomenon is described as extending beyond the US to other rich European nations.

**Critique**: The answer should summarize the meat of the article instead of the second sentence. As it stands, it's almost non-informative.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the second sentence of the answer does not effectively summarize the main content of the article and suggests that the summary should focus on the core message or main points of the article. However, it does not provide specific information about what the "meat of the article" is, leaving the editor without enough information to improve the summary without referring back to the source material.

How do the boy and the mother feel about each other?

**Answer**: It seems that both the boy and the mother care for each other but refuse to admit it.

**Critique**: "The empty women with her son. He was empty too." is evidence that neither mother nor son knew what to do with their emotions. There is no evidence of the son's feelings towards the mother in the story. Her son is empty when he returns and incapable of caring for his mother. Change the answer to reflect only the mother's feelings.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific evidence from the story ("The empty women with her son. He was empty too.") and clearly states that there is no evidence of the son's feelings towards the mother. It also suggests that the son is incapable of caring for his mother. This implies that the answer should focus solely on the mother's feelings, as there is no evidence of the son's feelings. Therefore, the critique gives enough information to revise the answer to reflect only the mother's feelings, without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: There is no evidence in the story that the boy missed his mother while he was out exploring the world. Change the answer to reflect this imbalance of care.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the boy did not miss his mother while he was out exploring the world. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by adjusting the statement about the boy's feelings. The critique implies that the relationship is imbalanced in terms of care, which can be reflected in the revised answer.

**Critique**: "And he was off to experience the world. Motherless." is evidence that the son leaves his mother to experience the world. Correct the action of the son in the answer.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific evidence that the son leaves his mother to experience the world, which implies that the current answer should be corrected to reflect this action. The critique suggests that the boy's action of leaving is significant and should be included in the answer.

How do the boy and the mother feel about each other?

**Answer**: The boy and his mother feel deeply connected to each other, but they also feel hurt and confusion because he left for awhile. However, both remain hopeful that he will return and their relationship can continue to grow.

**Critique**: "Slowly, quickly, coldly he spoke to his mother. "Fine," he would say. "You're not my mother," he would say." is evidence of the terms on which the son left his mother. Correct the answer to reflect that the boy denies the connection with his mother.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific evidence that contradicts the current answer's claim of a deep connection between the boy and his mother. It suggests that the boy denies the connection by quoting his dismissive and cold statements to his mother. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by changing the description of their relationship to reflect the boy's denial of the connection.

Is there a conflict between them? Is it resolved?

**Answer**: The conflict is that the boy emotionally takes from his mother and doesn't give back. The behavior doesn't change, but the mother resolves that it is the cycle of how things work.

**Critique**: "I hoped that she had finally found what she needed, but I wouldn't be the one to know." is evidence that it is unclear from the text if the conflict was ever resolved. Include this uncertainty in the text.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific evidence from the text ("I hoped that she had finally found what she needed, but I wouldn't be the one to know.") that suggests the resolution of the conflict is uncertain. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by incorporating this uncertainty into the explanation of the conflict's resolution.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Is there a conflict between them? Is it resolved?

**Answer**: It seems as though the conflict is that she understands all that her son means when he claims she's not his mother. It seems part of the conflict is resolved when he comes back.

**Critique**: "So she sat, she cared for him, and her life went on. "My little boy will be back any day now," she repeated to herself. But he was not. She didn't know who the broken down man sitting on her couch was. She knew he needed a mom, but she knew not who he was." is evidence that she did not recognize her son when he came back and that a part of the conflict still remained. Include this fact in the answer.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific evidence from the source material that indicates a part of the conflict remains unresolved. It suggests including the fact that she did not recognize her son when he came back, which directly addresses the question about whether the conflict is resolved. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by incorporating the unresolved aspect of the conflict.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific evidence of a conflict between the mother and the boy, which can be directly included in the answer.

**Critique**: "The first day I saw her after he came back I didn't recognize her."  is evidence that her son returned toward the end of the story. Remove the second sentence of the answer due to this. It is superfluous.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that the son's return happens toward the end of the story, which implies that the second sentence of the answer is not necessary for describing the setting. The critique suggests removing the second sentence because it is superfluous. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by focusing on the setting without the unnecessary detail about the son's return. Therefore, the critique is constructive as it guides the editor to improve the answer without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1717/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The story is about a mother who loves her son; the boy emotionally takes from his mother, and he emotionally hurts her. One day he leaves and she feels very empty; she waits for his return. He finally returns as a broken down man; he's empty. He continues to take from his mother, and she resolves that it is the cycle of how things work.

**Critique**: "I hoped that she had finally found what she needed, but I wouldn't be the one to know. Neither would the pastor. Only the boy. He would speak and we would listen, but we would never be sure." is evidence that the feelings of her son remains unclear. Include this as the final sentence in the answer.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific text that should be included in the answer, which allows for a concrete improvement without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: The narrator is a bystander to the story. The mother is one of the main characters of the story. Remove the first sentence of the answer.

### Sample 1721/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The boy would speak nonstop to his mother in complete gibberish, enjoying himself whenever his mother would understand the nonsense he spoke to her. She would give the boy everything he wanted, allowing him to leave her without a mother when he grew up. He would come back after years and the mother would quickly accept him. He would then leave again, leaving her without a son once more.

**Critique**: "Slowly, quickly, coldly he spoke to his mother. "Fine," he would say. "You're not my mother," he would say." is evidence that the boy hurts his mother with his words. Correct the answer to reflect the conflict between the mother and her son.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific evidence that the boy's words hurt his mother, which implies a conflict between them. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by incorporating the idea of verbal conflict into the summary. The critique suggests that the relationship is not just about the boy leaving and returning, but also about the emotional impact of his words on his mother.

### Sample 1722/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Why is the story obsessed with gender?

**Answer**: The story is obsessed with gender because the main characters are living in a society where gender is strictly regulated. The characters are constantly reminded of their gender, and the author notes that the couple is "more comfortable" with a "male" doctor. The story also mentions that the couple is not yet legally life partners, but they have cohabited for two and a half years, which is the legal requirement in their society. The author also notes that there are too many male children in their society, and that the couple will need to schedule a termination.

**Critique**: 'The story also mentions that the couple is not yet legally life partners, but they have cohabited for two and a half years, which is the legal requirement in their society. ' is irrelevant.

**Rationale**: The critique specifically identifies a portion of the answer as irrelevant, allowing for a concrete improvement by removing that part.

It implies that the story's setting involves enforced gender neutrality, which is different from the concept of a non-binary gender system. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by clarifying that the story is set in a future where gender neutrality is enforced, rather than simply stating that gender is no longer binary.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why do skiers carry a bag in one of the main races?

**Answer**: The skiers carry a pack as a way to symbolize the weight of an 18-month-old child. This race, along with the Norwegian Birkebeinerrennet and the American Birkebeiner, is one of three Birkebeiner Loppets held worldwide.

**Critique**: Judas 5 is a star

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It states that Judas 5 is a star, not a planet. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by correcting the description of Judas 5 from a planet to a star.

**Question**: Write a ~4 sentence summary.

**Answer**: The narrator is on a mission to check out the solar system around Judas 5, a star. The star is billions of miles from Earth. He pilots a small shuttle with only one other person for company, his computer. The retros are busted, so the narrator's mission is dreadfully cut short.

**Critique**: The star probably is "billions of miles from Earth" but that is not stated in the input

**Rationale**: The critique points out that the statement "billions of miles from Earth" is not supported by the input, implying that this part of the answer may be inaccurate or speculative. However, the critique does not provide an alternative or confirmable distance, nor does it suggest how to correct or replace this information.

**Critique**: Did not meet the 3-sentence summary requirement. Add one more sentence.

**Rationale**: The critique provides clear guidance on how to improve the answer by specifying that an additional sentence is needed to meet the requirement of a three-sentence summary. This is a straightforward instruction that can be acted upon without needing to refer back to the source material. The critique does not specify the content of the additional sentence, but it does not need to, as the requirement is purely structural (adding a sentence) rather than content-specific.

Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.

**Critique**: "President Trump says it doesn't matter if he misled the media about his son's infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian nationals." - while OK on its own, this statement needs a reason why the lie didn't matter. Add something about the New York Times.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests adding a reason why President Trump believed the lie didn't matter and mentions the New York Times, but it does not provide specific information about what to include regarding the New York Times.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Why is the 350-acre old-growth being purchased?

**Answer**: The old-growth forest in Cambridge-Narrows is being purchased by Community Forest International through its carbon offset program. The trees are storing tons of carbon and CFI is working to preserve mature forests and help reduce carbon emissions. The company pays CFI in order to preserve mature trees. The working land conservation easement placed on the property helps dictate what can or cannot be done on the land.

**Critique**: This doesn't really answer the question because the question asks "why" its being bought, not "how". Include that it's being sold because the owner, Weatherly, refuses to let it be cut

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It indicates that the reason for the purchase is related to the owner's refusal to allow the forest to be cut. This directly addresses the "why" aspect of the question, which was missing from the original answer.

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who is Robena Weatherly?

**Answer**: Robena Weatherly is an environmentalist who owns a 350-acre old-growth forest in Cambridge-Narrows. CFI has purchased the forest using carbon offset earnings, and has plans to put a "working land conservation easement" on the property to protect it.

**Critique**: The second sentence is irrelevant to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the second sentence is irrelevant to the question, which asks who Robena Weatherly is. This implies that the second sentence, which discusses CFI's actions regarding the forest, should be removed to improve the answer. The critique provides enough information to make this change without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1791/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Who is Robena Weatherly?

**Answer**: Robena Weatherly is an environmentalist who was approached by Community Forest International about selling her family's 350 acre forest. CFI purchased the forest through its carbon offset program with money contributed by Hemmings House Pictures. The land will be protected under a 'working land conservation easement'.

**Critique**: The second and third sentence are irrelevant to the question.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the second and third sentences are irrelevant to the question, which is about identifying who Robena Weatherly is. This implies that the answer should focus solely on her identity as an environmentalist. Therefore, I can improve the answer by removing the second and third sentences, leaving only the relevant information about her being an environmentalist. This can be done without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: This answer is false. There is no mention of her founding anything

**Rationale**: The critique states that the answer is false and specifically points out that there is no mention of Robena Weatherly founding anything. However, it does not provide any information about who Robena Weatherly actually is or what she is known for. Without additional details or corrections, I cannot improve the answer to accurately describe who Robena Weatherly is.

### Sample 1793/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Answer the following question based on the above passage:

Explain carbon offsetting.

**Answer**: Through carbon offsetting, businesses that emit more carbon than average offset their emissions by paying to preserve old-growth forests. They estimate their annual emissions, and CFI calculates how many tons of carbon a preserved forest can soak up. The amount is then divided into a set price, and the business pays CFI to preserve the old-growth forest. The old-growth forest is put under a "working land conservation easement" restricting what can happen on the land.

**Critique**: The final sentence isn't really necessary for answering the question.

**Rationale**: The critique specifies that the final sentence is unnecessary for answering the question about carbon offsetting. This implies that the sentence about the "working land conservation easement" can be removed to improve the answer. The critique provides clear guidance on what to change without needing to refer back to the source material.

### Sample 1799/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Community Forest International has bought an old-growth forest in Cambridge-Narrows through its carbon offset program. The forest, which has been in environmentalist Robena Weatherly's family for four generations, will now be preserved for the future. The deal was made possible by inputs from local business owner Greg Hemmings, and CFI plans to put a working land conservation easement on the property.

**Critique**: The article doesn't say the deal was made possible by Greg Hemmings. He's just named as someone who will be using the program.

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the statement about Greg Hemmings' role in making the deal possible is incorrect. It implies that the answer should be revised to reflect that Greg Hemmings is merely a participant in the program, not a key figure in facilitating the deal. Therefore, the answer can be improved by removing or altering the part about Greg Hemmings' involvement in making the deal possible, based on the information provided in the critique.

### Sample 1800/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Community Forest International is nonprofit organization based in Sackville, Nova Scotia. They buy old-growth forests in order to protect them from harvesting. They calculate how much a business emits and then pay to store this amount of carbon in their preserved forests.

**Critique**: The first and second sentence could be combined so that room could be made to mention WEatherly and how she sold her family's old growth forest to prevent it from being cut down.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests combining the first two sentences to make room for additional information about Weatherly and her actions. However, it does not provide specific details about Weatherly or her family's old-growth forest, such as who Weatherly is or the significance of her actions. Without this information, I cannot accurately incorporate the suggested content into the summary. Therefore, I would need to refer to the source material to understand and include the details about Weatherly and her family's forest.

### Sample 1801/1851 - [Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: Community Forest International has purchased an old-growth forest in Cambridge-Narrows through its carbon offset program, in order to preserve it for future generations. The non-profit is buying offsets from the forest to offset carbon produced by its client businesses. The forest, named the Robinson Conservation Forest, has trees dating back some 250-300 years old. The family that owned it, environmentalist Robena Weatherly, consulted her family and agreed the sale was the right thing to do. A "working land conservation easement" will protect the property moving forward.

**Critique**: The second and third sentence could be removed because the summary only calls for three sentences.

**Rationale**: The critique suggests removing the second and third sentences to meet the requirement of a three-sentence summary. This is a clear directive that allows for a concrete improvement to the answer by reducing its length to fit the specified format. The critique provides enough information to make this change without needing to refer back to the source material.

**Critique**: This should be in past tense and use "at the time of the article" for further accuracy.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific guidance on how to improve the answer by suggesting a change in tense and the addition of a phrase for temporal accuracy. This allows for a concrete improvement to the answer without needing to refer back to the source material. The editor can revise the sentences to past tense and include "at the time of the article" to enhance accuracy.

### Sample 1803/1851 - [Non-Constructive]

**Question**: Write a ~3 sentence summary.

**Answer**: This article describes the dealings of a 350-acre old-growth forest bought by Community Forest International charity working to preserve forests. They purchase the old-growth and make sure what is done with it is in keeping with their preservation program. They went to the people with the land and worked with them to make sure everything was in line with their needs since she plans to live where the remainder of the old-growth lies.

**Critique**: This article isn't about the dealings of the forest, but of the dealings between Weatherly and the charity. 

**Rationale**: The critique indicates that the focus of the article is not on the forest itself but on the interactions between Weatherly and the charity. This implies that the summary should be adjusted to emphasize the relationship and dealings between Weatherly and the charity rather than the forest. However, the critique does not provide specific details about these dealings, so it is unclear how to accurately rewrite the summary without additional information from the source material.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information about what Sandberg actually told the government officials of Canada and the EU.

**Critique**: It is not true that he continues to serve as Rampike's editor and publisher, as the journal ceased publication in 2016.

**Rationale**: The critique provides specific information that can be used to improve the answer. It states that the claim about Karl Jirgens continuing to serve as the editor and publisher of Rampike is incorrect because the journal ceased publication in 2016. This allows for a concrete revision of the answer by removing or correcting the part about his ongoing role with Rampike.
