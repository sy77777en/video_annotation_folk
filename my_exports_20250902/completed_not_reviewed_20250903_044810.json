The temple, with its ornate roof and stone statues, occupies the background, spanning from the left to the right side of the frame. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing more closely on the main subject while still including the surrounding individuals. In this new shot, the main subject remains in the center, but the camera angle brings him closer, making his upper body more prominent. The accompanying figures are now less visible, appearing smaller and partially cropped out. The temple continues to serve as the backdrop, though less of its details are visible due to the tighter framing.

After climbing over the structure, the character continues moving towards the upper right, reaching the archway, and is then located in the upper right of the middle ground. The user interface elements are located in the foreground, across the bottom third of the screen. Specifically, a magenta scroll-like element is on the bottom left, containing a white abstract pixelated figure next to \"04\" and, initially, a green shoe icon below it; this green shoe icon later disappears from the scroll and reappears as a magenta shoe in the middle ground, positioned near the left wall within the game world. In the bottom center, the yellow pixelated word \"DAY\" and the white text \"00\" are displayed in the foreground. Another magenta scroll-like element is on the bottom right in the foreground, framing a red-outlined rectangular area which contains a white, abstract, curled-up pixelated figure.",

The camera remains below the subject, looking upward, which emphasizes the character\u2019s elongated limbs and dynamic poses. Surrounding objects such as the black grand piano, trash bin, fire hydrant, park bench, and streetlight are distributed across the left, right, and bottom areas of the frame, occupying both the foreground and middle ground. Industrial elements like pipes, a railway bridge, and a construction crane are mostly in the background, stretching from the left to the right edges and sometimes intersecting the middle ground. As the subject moves, the camera smoothly tracks its motion, shifting the subject\u2019s position from center to left or right, while the surrounding objects and structures appear to float or tumble, creating a sense of shifting perspective and spatial disorientation. The background remains filled with abstract, watercolor-like splotches, providing a static yet visually complex backdrop to the moving elements in the foreground and middle ground.",

The setting includes a mix of urban and rural environments, featuring clusters of rectangular apartment buildings with flat roofs and light-colored facades, interspersed with patches of trees and green spaces. Roads and railways cut through the scene, connecting the residential area to open fields and industrial structures with large, flat roofs and cylindrical tanks. The surrounding countryside consists of wide, grassy fields and scattered wooded areas, stretching into the distance. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by greens, grays, and browns, with no visible overlays or text elements present in the video.",
