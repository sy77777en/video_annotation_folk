There is no instance of the camera zooming in to focus on specific areas of congestion or notable vehicle movements, nor does it pull back for a broader view of the entire system.\n\n2. There are no close-up shots \u2014 only wide and extreme wide shots are present.\n\n3. There is no tracking movement in the video.\n\n4. The perspective changes through cuts, but this was not mentioned.",
