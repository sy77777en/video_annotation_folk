He is looking slightly to his right, which corresponds to the left side of the frame, not \u201clooking slightly to his left.\u201d\n\n3. Since it is his image being shown, the description \u201calthough with a slight adjustment in his pose where his head is tilted further back in the second shown frame\u201d is incorrect \u2014 instead, his image is gradually enlarged over the course of the video.",
