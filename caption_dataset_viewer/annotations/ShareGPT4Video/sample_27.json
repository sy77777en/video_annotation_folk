The correct description should be \u201cwith only two orange glows visible at the bottom,\u201d not \u201cbottom left.\u201d\n\n3. In fact, the camera remains static throughout the entire video, with almost no movement or shaking.\n\n4. The distribution and intensity changes of the light orbs are unrelated to the camera and are solely caused by the movement and behavior of the orbs themselves.",
