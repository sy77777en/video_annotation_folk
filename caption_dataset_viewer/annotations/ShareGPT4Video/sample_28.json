  "critique": "1. At the beginning, the camera zooms in on the speaker from an overhead point of view, then the video cuts to a frontal shot that zooms out on the speaker. You didn\u2019t clarify the specific camera movements, nor did you mention the cuts between different shots.\n\n2. Due to the cuts and transitions between shots, the camera perspective is not consistently static or unchanging.",
