<summary><h2>Is Lighting Quality Complex (Ambiguous)</h2></summary>


<h3>游댯 Label Name:</h3>
<code>light_quality_is_complex_ambiguous</code>


<h3>游닀 Definition:</h3>
Does the scene lack sufficient visual information to determine light quality, due to non-physically realistic shading, absence of visible shadow-casting surface areas, or visual degradation?

<details>
<summary><h4> Question (Definition)</h4></summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4> Alternative Question</h4></summary>

- Are shadows or surface cues too unclear to assess lighting?

- Is the lighting in the video stylized or non-physical?

- Are important visual cues missing, abstract, or degraded?

- Does the scene lack visible surfaces or shadows to judge from?

- Is the video too visually noisy or distorted to identify lighting type?

- Is the lighting unreadable due to low resolution or exposure issues?

- Is the shading inconsistent with real-world lighting behavior?

- Is the lighting impossible to categorize based on available cues?

<details>
<summary><h4> Alternative Prompt</h4></summary>

- A video where shadows are missing, abstract, or implausible.

- A shot where lighting cues are visually degraded or inconsistent.

- A scene too ambiguous or stylized to assess real-world lighting.

- A video with insufficient detail to determine shadow or highlight behavior.

- A frame where no usable shadow-casting surface is visible.

- A video with noise, blur, or compression that obscures lighting cues.

- A visually unclear or low-information scene for lighting classification.

- A sequence where light quality cannot be reliably judged.

<summary><h2>Light Quality Is Hard</h2></summary>


<h3>游댯 Label Name:</h3>
<code>light_quality_is_hard</code>


<h3>游닀 Definition:</h3>
Are all or nearly all visible surface areas within the scene lit by hard light, indicated by sharp-edged shadows with narrow or no penumbrae, or abrupt light-to-dark transitions, or textures that are strongly emphasized, or highlights that are small and bright, and no noticeable signs of soft light?
