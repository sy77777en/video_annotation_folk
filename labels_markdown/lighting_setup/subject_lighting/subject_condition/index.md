<summary><h2>Subject Lighting Is Unrealistic</h2></summary>


<h3>游댯 Label Name:</h3>
<code>is_subject_lighting_unrealistic</code>


<h3>游닀 Definition:</h3>
Does the video contain subjects, but the lighting is non-physically realistic, including animated, stylized, synthetic, 2D, or 2.5D content, making it too visually abstract to reliably analyze contrast and lighting direction?

<details>
<summary><h4> Question (Definition)</h4></summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4> Alternative Question</h4></summary>

- Is the lighting physically unrealistic or abstract?

- Is the scene 2D or 2.5D with unclear lighting properties?

- Are the lighting properties ambiguous or hard to interpret?

- Does the scene lack consistent shading or shadows?

- Is the lighting analysis too complex or uncertain?

- Are the lighting effects too stylized to analyze?

<summary><h2>Unclear or Light-Emitting Subject</h2></summary>


<h3>游댯 Label Name:</h3>
<code>is_unclear_or_light_emitting_subject</code>


<h3>游닀 Definition:</h3>
Does the video lack a clear subject visibly illuminated by external light, either because the subject is absent, ambiguous (e.g., scenery shot), or emits light or is engulfed by a light source in a way that obscures form shadows and highlights, making contrast and direction unreliable to judge?

<details>
<summary><h4> Question (Definition)</h4></summary>

</details>
