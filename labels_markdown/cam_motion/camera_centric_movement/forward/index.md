<summary><h2>Has Forward Movement (Relative to Camera)</h2></summary>


<h3>ðŸ”µ Label Name:</h3>
<code>has_forward_wrt_camera</code>


<h3>ðŸ“– Definition:</h3>
Does the camera move forward (not zooming in) with respect to the initial frame?

<details>
<summary><h4> Question (Definition)</h4></summary>

- Does the camera move forward in space based on its starting position?

- Is the camera moving forward (not zooming in) with respect to itself, creating a noticeable parallax effect?

- Is the forward motion of the camera clear in this shot by comparing the start and end of the shot?

- Is the camera dollying in with respect to itself?

- Is the camera dollying forward with respect to itself?

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4> Alternative Question</h4></summary>

- Does the camera move forward (not zooming in)?

- Is the camera moving forward?

- Is there clear forward movement when comparing the start and end of the shot?

- Does the camera travel forward in space, rather than zooming in?

- Is the camera pushing forward through the space?

- Does the shot feature a clear forward motion of the camera?

- Is the cameraâ€™s movement progressing forward rather than backward?

- Is the forward motion of the camera clear in this shot?

- Does the camera travel forward in space, rather than zooming in?

- Is the camera advancing in the scene?

- Does the perspective shift forward rather than relying on zoom?

- Is the camera physically traveling forward instead of adjusting focal length?

- Is the camera advancing, creating a strong sense of depth?
