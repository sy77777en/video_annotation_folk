<summary><h2>Has Backward Movement (Relative to Camera)</h2></summary>


<h3>ðŸ”µ Label Name:</h3>
<code>has_backward_wrt_camera</code>


<h3>ðŸ“– Definition:</h3>
Does the camera move backward (not zooming out) with respect to the initial frame?

<details>
<summary><h4> Question (Definition)</h4></summary>

- Does the camera move backward in space based on its starting position?

- Is the camera moving backward (not zooming out) with respect to itself, creating a noticeable parallax effect?

- Is the backward motion of the camera clear in this shot by comparing the start and end of the shot?

- Is the camera dollying out with respect to itself?

- Is the camera pulling back with respect to itself?

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4> Alternative Question</h4></summary>

- Does the camera move backward (not zooming out)?

- Is the camera moving backward?

- Is there clear backward movement when comparing the start and end of the shot?

- Does the camera travel backward in space, rather than zooming out?

- Is the camera pulling back through the space?

- Does the shot feature a clear backward motion of the camera?

- Is the camera's movement progressing backward rather than forward?

- Is the backward motion of the camera clear in this shot?

- Does the camera travel backward in space, rather than zooming out?

- Is the camera retreating in the scene?

- Does the perspective shift backward rather than relying on zoom?

- Is the camera physically traveling backward instead of adjusting focal length?

- Is the camera pulling back, creating a strong sense of depth?
