<h3>ðŸ“– Definition:</h3>
Does the camera move upward (not tilting up) with respect to the initial frame?

<details>
<summary><h4> Question (Definition)</h4></summary>

- Is the camera moving upward in space based on its starting position?

- Is the camera moving upward (not tilting up) with respect to itself, creating a noticeable vertical parallax effect?

- Is the upward motion of the camera clear in this shot by comparing the start and end of the shot?

- Is the camera performing a pedestal up movement?

- Is the camera elevating with respect to itself?

</details>
