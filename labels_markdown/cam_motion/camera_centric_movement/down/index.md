# Down Overview

<details>
<summary><h2>Has Downward Movement (Relative to Camera)</h2></summary>


<h3>ðŸ”µ Label Name:</h3>
<code>has_down_wrt_camera</code>


<h3>ðŸ“– Definition:</h3>
Does the camera move downward (not tilting down) with respect to the initial frame?

<details>
<summary><h4> Question (Definition)</h4></summary>

- Is the camera moving downward in space based on its starting position?

- Is the camera moving downward (not tilting down) with respect to itself, creating a noticeable vertical parallax effect?

- Is the downward motion of the camera clear in this shot by comparing the start and end of the shot?

- Is the camera performing a pedestal down movement?

- Is the camera descending with respect to itself?

</details>

<summary><h4> Alternative Question</h4></summary>

- Does the camera move downward (not tilting down)?

- Is the camera moving downward?

- Is there clear downward movement when comparing the start and end of the shot?

- Does the camera travel downward in space, rather than tilting down?

- Is the camera lowering through the space?

- Does the shot feature a clear downward motion of the camera?

- Is the camera's movement progressing downward rather than upward?

- Is the downward motion of the camera clear in this shot?

- Does the camera travel downward in space, rather than tilting down?

- Is the camera descending in the scene?

- Does the perspective shift downward rather than relying on tilt?

- Is the camera physically traveling downward instead of rotating?

- Is the camera lowering, creating a strong sense of vertical movement?
