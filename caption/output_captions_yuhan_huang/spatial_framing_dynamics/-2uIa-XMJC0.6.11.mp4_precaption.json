    "pre_caption": "The video captures a first-person perspective within a modern, high-tech indoor setting. In the center of the scene, a large, transparent screen dominates the middle ground, displaying a circular digital interface with a man in a gray hoodie and necklace. This man occupies the central area of the circular frame, which is positioned in the middle of the screen. To the right of the screen, in the background, there is a colorful wall with shades of blue, pink, and white. On the left side of the screen, in the foreground, a low shelving unit holds various items, including what appears to be a vinyl record player. As the video progresses, a hand wearing a red sleeve enters from the bottom of the frame, interacting with the screen's controls located at the bottom edge. Simultaneously, a smaller circular inset appears near the bottom right corner of the screen, showing another individual in a red hoodie. The camera remains at eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent viewpoint relative to the subjects and objects in the scene. The overall spatial arrangement emphasizes the interaction between the viewer and the digital interface, with the screen acting as the focal point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a man with short, brown hair, wearing a gray hoodie and a necklace, appearing within a circular frame that resembles a digital interface. A smaller circular frame appears, featuring a Black man in a red hoodie, with a focused expression. The setting suggests a virtual or digital communication scenario, viewed from a first-person perspective as the red hoodie man's hand briefly appears at the bottom of the screen. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot set indoors, featuring a modern, high-tech environment with floor-to-ceiling windows. A large, transparent screen displays a video call interface with a circular view of an outdoor urban setting, showing buildings and a clear sky. The time of day appears to be daytime, with bright natural light illuminating the scene. The screen also includes a smaller circular inset showing another person, suggesting a conversation. The room is sleek and futuristic, with colorful walls in shades of blue, pink, and white, and a low shelving unit on the left side, emphasizing digital communication technology.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
