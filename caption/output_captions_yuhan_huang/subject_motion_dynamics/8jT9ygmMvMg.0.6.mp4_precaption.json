As the camera progresses, the buildings on the left and right sides of the canal become more detailed, showing a mix of orange, yellow, and beige facades. The camera continues to move forward, revealing more of the canal and the buildings, including some greenery along the left side. As the camera ascends, the rooftops of the buildings come into view, showing terracotta tiles and various architectural details. The camera continues to rise, providing a broader view of the canal and the densely packed buildings, with more rooftops and distant structures becoming visible.",
