    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of the man, who is positioned slightly off-center to the left in the foreground. He stands in front of electronic equipment, including speakers and a monitor, which are located in the middle ground towards the left side of the frame. The man initially faces sideways, with his body oriented towards the right. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium close-up, bringing the man closer to the center of the frame. His gestures become more prominent; he raises his hand near his head, indicating interaction or communication. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. The background remains dimly lit with a greenish tint, emphasizing the low-light conditions and the presence of technology in the room. The man's movement from a sideways stance to a frontal orientation, along with his hand gestures, adds a dynamic element to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium build. He is wearing a dark bandana with a speckled pattern and a jacket over a dark shirt with a visible graphic or text. In the first part of the video, he is standing sideways to the camera, and in the second part, he gradually turns to face the camera, gesturing with his hand near his head while holding a cigarette. The setting appears to be dimly lit, with a greenish tint, suggesting night vision or low-light conditions.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a dimly lit room with a night vision effect, casting a green tint over the scene. The environment suggests a studio or control room, but due to the low-light conditions, the specific electronic equipment is difficult to identify. The walls are dark, and minimal lighting creates a shadowy atmosphere. A person is present, moving within the space, but they do not appear to be interacting with any visible devices. The scene is characterized by its low-light ambiance and the presence of technology, with the person adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
