    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer\u2019s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as \u201ca narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls\u201d or \u201ca vast desert with rolling dunes.\u201d Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like \u201ca rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights\u201d or \u201ca snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.\u201d For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as \u201ca wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.\u201d If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., \u201cThe shot transitions from day to night\u201d) or movement-based shifts (e.g., \u201cThe camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street\u201d). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes.**\"",
    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures an outdoor urban scene during the day. The video pans slightly right along a sidewalk paved with small square tiles. In the immediate foreground is a low, curved wall made of dark grey stone blocks, surmounted by a frosted glass barrier. Directly behind this structure are buildings lining the sidewalk. One building presents a light green, boarded-up facade adorned with various posters and blue and pink graffiti. Adjacent to it is another building entrance featuring a large glass window and door, partially covered by light-colored curtains from the inside, with small signs visible on the window pane. A dark drainpipe runs vertically down the building wall between these two sections. The sky visible above is clear blue.",
