    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer\u2019s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as \u201ca narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls\u201d or \u201ca vast desert with rolling dunes.\u201d Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like \u201ca rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights\u201d or \u201ca snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.\u201d For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as \u201ca wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.\u201d If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., \u201cThe shot transitions from day to night\u201d) or movement-based shifts (e.g., \u201cThe camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street\u201d). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle showing the environment in a three-quarters perspective.**\"",
    "pre_caption": "A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows the environment in a three-quarters perspective. The scene is set indoors within a dimly lit, rectangular room featuring aged, brownish walls and a large, light-brown woven rug covering most of the floor. A prominent stone fireplace with a lit fire occupies the back wall, flanked by bookshelves filled with books. Other furniture includes a wooden table and chairs near the fireplace and candlesticks providing light. An attached L-shaped entryway contains a small round wooden table, a standing candelabra, and a smaller rug. The area surrounding the visible room is entirely black. A character in green robes stands centrally in the main room, while another character in dark clothing is positioned in the entryway. Overlays are present: text at the bottom center indicates experience points gained and a level achieved; a Heads-Up Display (HUD) with icons and status bars occupies the bottom edge; a minimap is in the top-left corner; and a red circular \"TALK\" icon appears over the character in the entryway during the video.",
