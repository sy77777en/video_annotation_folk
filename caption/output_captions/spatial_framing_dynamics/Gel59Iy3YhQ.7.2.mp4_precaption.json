    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person's light-skinned hand, which has glowing, light-blue, vein-like markings on its back, gently pets a small, fantastical creature. The creature is round, covered in dark blue, velvety fur, and has large, black, expressive eyes. Atop its head is a crown-like arrangement of green leaves and small, brown, twig-like horns. The person's fingers stroke the creature's belly, causing it to close its eyes and nuzzle into the touch with a content expression. At the end of the video, the creature looks down and appears surprised by the markings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a lush, green forest with a soft-focus background, a person's hand gently interacts with a small creature. The creature is dark blue with a soft, furry texture, large black eyes, and a crown made of green leaves and small wooden branches. The hand, which has glowing blue, vein-like patterns on its skin, is seen touching the creature's belly. A reddish, textured cuff is visible on the person's wrist.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a small, blue creature is positioned in the foreground, slightly left of center. A hand, also in the foreground, occupies the center and right portions of the frame, gently stroking the creature. The creature initially looks up, then closes its eyes and nuzzles the hand before looking down towards the glowing markings on the hand. The background is composed of a blurry, out-of-focus green forest. The camera maintains a high-angle perspective, looking down upon the interaction.",
