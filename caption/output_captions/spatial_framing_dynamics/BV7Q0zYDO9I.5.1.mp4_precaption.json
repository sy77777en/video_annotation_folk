    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features several humanoid figures. In the midground, four light gray figures are in a push-up position on a gray floor, serving as the main focus of the scene. These figures are bald and wear light gray, short-sleeved t-shirts and shorts. The second and third figures from the left have distinctive black and white patterned forearms and hands, resembling robotic or prosthetic limbs, while the other two midground figures have plain light gray limbs. In the true foreground, a blurred blue figure is visible on the left side of the frame. Additionally, there are three blurred blue figures in the midground, not in the background, appearing to wear uniform-like attire including boots, and seem to be observing the figures performing push-ups.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting, characterized by a spacious hall with a smooth, grey floor and plain, light grey walls. In the midground, multiple humanoid figures, primarily white or light grey, are in a push-up position; some of these figures display black markings on their arms. In the foreground on the far left of the frame, there is a blue figure. Further back, several uniformly blue humanoid figures are standing, with three of them positioned behind the white or light grey figures. The scene is illuminated by even, diffuse lighting. An overlay text [40] is visible in the lower left corner of the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot. In the midground, four light gray figures are arranged horizontally across the center of the frame, performing push-ups. A blurred blue figure is visible in the foreground on the left side. Three additional blurred blue figures stand in the midground, positioned behind and slightly to the sides of the light gray figures. The camera is positioned at the level of the figures performing push-ups.",
