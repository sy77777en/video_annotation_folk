    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man wearing a dark, bulky spacesuit with a helmet that has a clear visor. His face is visible, showing a focused expression. The suit includes a backpack-like apparatus, suggesting space exploration or a similar environment. The man is oriented sideways, appearing to be in a confined or narrow space, possibly maneuvering or inspecting something. The lighting highlights the contours of his suit and helmet, emphasizing the technical and protective nature of his attire.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an indoor setting with low-key lighting. The environment features tall, dark, vertically ribbed walls or structures that dominate the background. These structures have a somewhat metallic appearance. An astronaut in a white and grey helmet and suit is visible in the foreground, partially lit, contrasting with the surrounding shadows.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a man in a spacesuit positioned slightly right of center in the middle ground, facing towards the left side of the frame. Tall, dark, ribbed structures occupy the background, particularly prominent on the left and top. The shot then transitions smoothly into a medium close-up, bringing the man's helmeted head and upper torso closer to the viewer while maintaining his position slightly right of center in the middle ground. During this transition, the man slightly lowers his head. The background structures remain visible but are less encompassing due to the tighter framing. Throughout the shot, the camera remains at the subject's level.",
