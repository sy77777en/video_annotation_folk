    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, light-yellow, oblong squash rests horizontally on a white, rectangular block. The squash is ribbed, with a thick, green vine attached to its left end and a dried, woody stem protruding from the right. To the right of the squash, a dark green baseball cap sits on a wooden surface. The cap features a circular logo on the front with an orange graphic in the center and white text that reads \"Giant Pumpkins\" and \"San Mateo\". In this time-lapse video, the squash initially appears on the rectangular platform, but as the video progresses, the platform disappears, and the squash is shown resting directly on the table.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Inside a structure with white fabric walls, a large, light-yellow, oblong squash is displayed on a pale, rectangular block. The block and squash are positioned on a wooden plank surface. A thick green vine, still attached to the squash, extends to the left. Next to the squash on the right is a dark green baseball cap with a distinct logo on its front. The camera remains stationary, providing a clear view of the squash, its vine, and the cap.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a large yellow squash rests on a white block in the center middle ground. To its right, a green baseball cap is positioned in the bottom right middle ground on a wooden table that spans the lower half of the frame. A green vine attached to the squash extends from the center-left towards the background, which is composed of white fabric walls. The video then transitions, showing the squash now resting directly on the wooden table in the center middle ground, with the white block having been removed from the scene. During this change, the camera briefly pans left, repositioning the squash to the right side of the frame, before panning back to the right to re-center the subject. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the video.",
