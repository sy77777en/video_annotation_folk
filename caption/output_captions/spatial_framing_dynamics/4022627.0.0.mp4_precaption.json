    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A multitude of dried banana chips are shown in a close-up, top-down view. The chips are thin, circular to oval slices, with a light yellow to pale beige color. The chips feature slightly darker, brownish, and somewhat textured centers, indicative of where the seeds were, and some chips also feature darker yellow centers around their seeds. The chips are piled together, creating a textured surface, with some pieces slightly curled or broken. The light wooden surface beneath the chips is visible in a few areas. The camera rotates slowly in a clockwise direction, creating the illusion that the chips are moving counterclockwise in circles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A top-down, close-up shot shows a pile of dried banana chips on a light-colored wooden surface. The chips are thin, ranging from round to oval in shape, with colors varying from light yellow to light beige, and each piece has a darker, brownish, textured center.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "In this close-up, top-down shot, a pile of dried banana chips fills the entire frame, occupying the foreground. The chips are spread evenly from edge to edge, creating a single, textured layer. The camera is positioned directly above the subjects and rotates slowly in a clockwise direction, which creates the visual effect of the entire pile of chips rotating counter-clockwise.",
