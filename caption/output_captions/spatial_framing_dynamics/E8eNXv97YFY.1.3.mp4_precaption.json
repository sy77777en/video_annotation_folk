    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of people and several vehicles are gathered on the deck of a ferry. The vehicles include a dark green SUV on the left with a spare tire mounted on its rear, a silver car in the center, and a black SUV on the right. A portion of a white car is visible in the lower-left foreground, and a motorcycle is positioned in the space between the green, silver, and black vehicles. The people, mostly men of various ages with light to medium brown skin, are dressed in casual attire such as T-shirts and collared shirts. They are positioned around and on top of the vehicles, some standing and others sitting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From the deck of a moving ferry, the scene captures a crossing over a wide body of water during a dramatic sunset. The sky is filled with dark, heavy clouds, while the horizon glows with orange and yellow light from the setting sun. In the distance, a city skyline is silhouetted against the colorful sky. The ferry's deck is crowded with vehicles, including a dark green SUV and a black SUV, parked alongside motorcycles. Numerous passengers are visible among the vehicles, standing and sitting as the ferry moves through the choppy water, which reflects the evening light.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, the deck of a ferry occupies the lower half of the frame, filled with vehicles and people. A green SUV is on the left, a silver car is in the center, and a black SUV is on the right, all positioned in the middle ground. People are scattered around and between these vehicles in the foreground and middle ground. The ferry is moving forward across a body of water that extends from the immediate foreground to the background. In the distant background, a city skyline stretches across the horizontal center of the frame, silhouetted against a sunset sky that fills the top portion of the scene. The primary movement is the ferry traveling forward, causing the water to rush past the sides of the vessel.",
