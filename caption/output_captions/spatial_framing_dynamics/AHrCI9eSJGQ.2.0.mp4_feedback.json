    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a high-angle perspective. In the foreground, the tops of shipping containers occupy the bottom third of the frame, leading from the bottom corners toward the center. The dark ocean fills the middle ground, situated horizontally across the center of the scene. In the background, the sky occupies the top two-thirds of the frame, with a band of dark clouds positioned just above the horizon and a vast, star-filled sky visible above the clouds. A text and logo overlay is positioned in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a breathtaking maritime scenery shot captured from the bow of a massive container ship on the open ocean at night. Above, a spectacular, star-studded sky, featuring the dense band of the Milky Way, is partially obscured by low, dark clouds. A distant thunderstorm flashes intermittently, illuminating the cloud formations from within and casting a faint glow on the horizon. The shot lacks a single main subject, instead emphasizing the immense scale and atmosphere of the natural environment. The focus is on the awe-inspiring juxtaposition of the serene, star-filled cosmos and the dynamic, stormy weather over the vast, dark sea. The ship itself serves primarily as a vantage point, with the tops of its containers in the foreground guiding the viewer's gaze into the epic scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Aboard a container ship at night, the scene captures stacks of red and dark-colored shipping containers extending toward the open sea. Above, a vast, star-filled sky displays the Milky Way. Low on the horizon, dark clouds are intermittently illuminated from within by flashes of lightning. The sea is dark, with a few distant lights visible on the horizon. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays a red YouTube logo next to the white text \"JEFFHK\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
