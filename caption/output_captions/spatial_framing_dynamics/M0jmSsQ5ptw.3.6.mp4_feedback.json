    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of an outdoor scene, with a large wooden crane positioned in the right middle ground. A toy biplane hangs from the crane's arm in the center-right middle ground, while a white mailbag is suspended between two smaller wooden posts in the center-left middle ground. The background is composed of an arid field and distant mountains. As the crane's arm rotates, the camera moves in, reframing the scene to a medium shot. The toy plane travels from the right to the left across the middle ground, eventually reaching the center-left of the frame where it hooks the mailbag. The camera maintains a position at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, yellow, wooden lattice crane stands on the right, featuring a tall A-frame base and a long, rotating arm from which a large, black, trapezoidal prism counterweight hangs. Suspended from the front of the crane's arm is a light-yellow toy biplane with two sets of wings, wheels, and red and blue markings on its tail. As the crane's arm rotates, the toy plane moves along a wire and uses a hook to catch a white cloth bag with the word \"MAIL\" printed on it in black. The bag is suspended on a separate line stretched between two smaller, yellow wooden A-frame posts.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene is set in a wide, arid field under a partly cloudy blue sky. A large, wooden, lattice-style crane stands on the right, featuring a black trapezoidal prism counterweight suspended by a chain. To the left, a series of wooden A-frame supports holds a taut wire. A small, tan model biplane is suspended from this wire, moving from right to left. A white bag with \"MAIL\" printed on it is attached to a separate line stretched between two smaller, yellow wooden A-frame posts. As the crane's arm rotates, the toy plane uses a hook to catch the mailbag. The background consists of a dry, grassy expanse with a wire fence, and distant hills and buildings are visible on the horizon.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of an outdoor experimental setup with several yellow structures, including a rotating crane holding a yellow toy plane, set against a backdrop of open fields and distant mountains. The crane rotates as the camera moves closer. Then, the toy plane hooks a white bag suspended in the air. \n\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
