    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a man with brown skin is shown laying bricks. He is wearing purple patterned shorts, a white sleeve on his left arm, and a black band on his right wrist. His hands are actively positioning a rectangular, reddish-orange brick onto a wall structure that is being built with wet, gray mortar. Below him, a green plastic basin contains more mortar and a trowel with an orange handle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, is set at an outdoor construction site during the day. The perspective looks down past the person's legs and feet towards their hands, which are carefully placing a rectangular, reddish-orange brick onto a layer of wet, gray mortar. This brick is being added to a low wall built upon a rough concrete foundation. The ground below is reddish-brown dirt, and approximately one story below, a blue hose is visible. On the same elevated level as the person, a green tub of mortar is positioned to the left of their legs, and a thin white guideline string is located to the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, a person's hands and a brick are centered in the foreground, positioned directly above a low wall that stretches horizontally across the middle ground. The person's legs and feet occupy the bottom center of the frame in the foreground. In the middle ground, a green basin of mortar is located in the bottom left, while a concrete structure and a thin white guideline string are on the right. The ground of the construction site is visible in the background at the top of the frame. The hands make slight adjustments, tapping the brick into place on the wall.",
