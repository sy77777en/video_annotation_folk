    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man is positioned in the left foreground against a solid black background. He is initially seen from the chest up in profile, looking upward. As he raises his arms and tilts his head back to face the top of the frame, the camera tilts upward to follow his movement. This action causes his head to move toward the center of the frame, and the shot tightens on his face and neck. The camera is positioned below the subject, looking up at him throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Against a completely dark background, a Black man with braided hair is visible. He wears a dark green jacket or jumpsuit, which has a yellow and black circular patch on the left side of the chest and appears slightly distressed. Around his neck is a thick, chunky necklace. He looks upward with his mouth slightly open and raises his arms, captured from what seems to be a low-angle perspective.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a solid black background, a person in a dark green jacket raises their arms and looks upward. The jacket features a zipper on the chest and a small, circular yellow and black pin on his right breast. A thick, beaded necklace is visible around the person's neck, and their hair is styled in braids. The scene is dimly lit, with light catching the side of the person's face and jacket.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
