    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot depicting a long, narrow, and seemingly endless corridor. The focus is on the disorienting and vast scale of the environment itself, creating an eerie, liminal atmosphere rather than highlighting a specific subject. Every surface, including the floor and the towering parallel walls, is covered in a uniform grid of small, pale yellowish-green tiles with dark grout lines. The space is filled with a thick, hazy fog that obscures the far end of the corridor, and the scene is bathed in a diffuse, sourceless light of the same sickly green-yellow hue, enhancing the unsettling and sterile quality of the location. The perspective is slightly distorted with darkened, curved edges, as if viewed from inside a mask or through a wide-angle lens.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moves through a long and narrow corridor. The walls, floor, and ceiling are completely covered in small, square, off-white tiles with dark grout, creating a uniform grid pattern throughout the space. The corridor is illuminated by a diffuse, yellowish-green light, and the far end disappears into a bright, hazy mist. Beyond the mist, the space continues with the same design, featuring small, square, off-white tiles with dark grout.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot from a first-person perspective, presented as a wide shot. The camera is positioned at the start of a long, narrow corridor, with towering tiled walls occupying the left and right sides of the frame and a tiled floor at the bottom. These surfaces converge toward the center background, where the corridor disappears into a bright, hazy mist. The camera moves steadily forward down the center of the corridor, causing the walls and floor to scroll past from the foreground toward the background. The entire scene is framed with darkened, curved edges, suggesting the view is seen through a mask or a wide-angle lens.",
