    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium-long shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, with his arms outstretched. He is situated in a grassy field, while rolling hills covered in trees occupy the background. The camera then moves steadily forward, causing the framing to tighten from a medium-long shot into a close-up that centers on the man's face and upper chest as he looks up. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man is shown smiling with his arms outstretched. He wears a red headwrap with white circular patterns, which is tied into puffy knots on the sides of his head. He has on a white pearl necklace. His outfit consists of a large, unzipped, blue puffy jacket with a colorful floral pattern and matching pants. The jacket has wide, wing-like sleeves that are spread out as he holds his arms to the side, revealing his skin and visible tattoos near his upper body and abdomen. He looks up with a smile.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a sunlit, open field filled with dry, golden-brown grass. In the background, rolling hills are densely covered with dark green trees under a clear sky. A person wearing a colorful, puffy jacket and a red head covering moves through the field with their arms outstretched. The entire scene is captured with a grainy, film-like quality, giving it a vintage aesthetic as the camera follows the person's movement.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
