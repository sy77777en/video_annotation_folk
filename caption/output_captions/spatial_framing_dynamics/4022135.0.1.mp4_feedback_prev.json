    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle wide shot from the stadium stands, capturing the football field in the middle ground, which extends from the bottom to the center of the frame. The stands on the opposite side fill the background across the top half of the frame, with a cloudy sky visible above. Initially, the back of a spectator's head is in the bottom right foreground. The camera then pans to the right, revealing more of the stadium. This movement brings the right end zone and a goalpost into the middle ground on the right side, while a building labeled \"RYAN FIELD\" enters the frame in the background on the far right. Simultaneously, more spectators in the immediate foreground are revealed at the bottom right, including a man in a cap shown in profile, as the initial spectator's head shifts toward the bottom center of the view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures an open-air football stadium during a game, with the stands densely packed with spectators, many of whom are wearing purple and yellow attire. The green football field is marked with white yard lines, a large \"N\" logo at midfield, and \"BIG\" logos. Players in white uniforms with purple numbers and helmets are visible on the field, engaged in gameplay. Two tall light towers with bright lights illuminate the stadium under an overcast sky. As the camera pans to the right, the building labeled \"RYAN FIELD\" becomes visible, along with several spectators in the foreground at the right corner of the scene. One individual, seen from the back, has light brown hair and wears a red visor. Next to this person, a man with light skin is shown in profile, looking towards the field; he wears a dark green baseball cap and a grey long-sleeved top. Partially visible behind him is a woman with blonde hair, and another spectator wearing a purple hat is seen in the lower right. The pan also reveals more of the field, including a purple end zone with \"WILDCATS\" written in white and a goalpost. Many other people are visible in the row.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A level-angle, panning shot captures a wide view of a crowded American football stadium, Ryan Field, on an overcast day. The green turf is marked with white yard lines, a large white \"N\" logo at midfield, and the word \"WILDCATS\" in the end zone. Football players in white and dark uniforms are positioned on the field. The stands are packed with thousands of spectators, many wearing purple. Beyond the stadium, a line of green trees and distant buildings are visible beneath a grey sky. Tall light towers with bright lights are on. As the camera pans to the right, it reveals more of the stadium's architecture, including a tan building with \"RYAN FIELD\" inscribed on its side. The back of a spectator's head is visible in the foreground at the bottom of the view.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an open-air stadium during a game, with the stands filled with spectators. The camera is positioned in the stand, initially showing the field and the stands opposite. It then pans to the right, showing some people in the foreground at the frame's right corner, along with parts of the field and distant stands.",
