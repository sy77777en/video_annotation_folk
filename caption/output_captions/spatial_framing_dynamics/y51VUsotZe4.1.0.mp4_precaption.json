    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This black and white video primarily features a light-colored, vintage sedan, likely from the 1940s or early 1950s, driving towards the viewer in the center of a dark street at night. The car has two bright, round headlights and a prominent, multi-slatted grille. As it moves forward, it passes by other light-colored vintage cars with illuminated round headlights. Further left, a building displays a partially visible sign reading \"RKO THEA\". The street is illuminated by rows of streetlights that appear as receding dots of light on both sides, with other dark vehicles parked along the roadside.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a nighttime scene on a city street, rendered in black and white. The camera's perspective appears to be from within a moving vehicle, looking forward down a dark road marked with a white lane divider. Several vintage cars with illuminated headlights are visible, with one light-colored car prominently positioned slightly to the left of center, also moving forward. On the left, a building with a lit sign reading \"RKO THEA\" is partially visible. Rows of streetlights appear as bright, receding dots in the distance, and other indistinct lights dot the surrounding dark buildings. The overall atmosphere is dark, with the primary illumination coming from the vehicle headlights and the streetlights.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a nighttime street scene. A light-colored vintage sedan is initially in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground and moving towards the foreground. To its left, another light-colored vintage car is also in the middle ground, moving forward. Further left, in the middle ground, a building displays a partially visible \"RKO THEA\" sign. Rows of streetlights are visible on both sides of the street, receding into the background. As the main sedan and the car to its left advance towards the foreground, increasing in size within the frame, the \"RKO THEA\" sign moves towards the left foreground before exiting the frame to the left. A white lane divider is visible in the center foreground, extending into the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
