    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a large, muscular humanoid figure with green skin, initially positioned on all fours in the foreground. The figure occupies the central part of the frame, with its body extending from the bottom left towards the center. In the background, stone buildings with architectural arches are visible, situated in the middle ground, while the sky forms the top portion of the frame. As the video progresses, the figure transitions from a crouched position to standing upright, shifting its 2D position slightly upwards and towards the center-right. This movement brings the figure's broad shoulders and upper body more prominently into view. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. The surrounding grassy area and stone structures remain static in the background, providing a stable backdrop for the subject's dynamic change in posture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a large, muscular humanoid figure with green skin and dark hair. Initially, the figure is on all fours, displaying a powerful and imposing physique. Later, it stands upright, highlighting its broad shoulders and intense expression. The subject is wearing dark pants, and its overall appearance is characterized by a robust and formidable build.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting on a grassy area surrounded by stone buildings, suggesting a campus or historical site. The time of day appears to be daytime, with mostly cloudy skies and only a few patches of blue visible. The environment is characterized by well-maintained grass and the presence of large, imposing stone structures with architectural arches, adding a sense of grandeur. The scene includes a large, muscular figure with green skin, positioned prominently in the foreground, displaying a powerful stance. The figure's rough and detailed texture emphasizes its strength and disrupts the otherwise calm atmosphere, creating a dynamic visual contrast.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
