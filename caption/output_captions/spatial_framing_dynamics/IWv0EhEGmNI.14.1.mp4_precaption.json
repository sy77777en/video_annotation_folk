    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two armed individuals dressed in full military gear, including camouflage uniforms, tactical vests, helmets, and backpacks. One person, whose hands and weapon are visible in the foreground, holds a black firearm and appears to be following the other, who is walking ahead and facing away. Both individuals are equipped with gloves and other standard combat accessories. Suddenly, the player in front jumps to the left and flies downstairs as an explosion occurs outside the window. In an instant, broken wooden boards, debris, flames, and smoke fill the field of vision, and the player is blown backwards, creating a tense, action-oriented environment involving military personnel navigating a hazardous area with significant destruction.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is presented from a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, and takes place indoors within a dimly lit, narrow hallway of a house or building. The environment features wooden floors and walls, with portraits of the characters hanging on the wall. A figure in military gear, wearing camouflage and carrying equipment, moves ahead in the hallway, their placement reinforcing the sense of urgency. Suddenly, an explosion occurs, causing flames to shoot up into the sky, with orange-red blast waves and debris flying everywhere. Dust fills the air, and the characters are swept away by the impact, resulting in a disoriented perspective. The outline of the characters' hands can be seen at the bottom of the screen. At the moment of the explosion, the screen is superimposed with dust and blood, enhancing the chaotic atmosphere. The color palette is dominated by dark browns, yellows, and the orange glow of fire. Overlay elements are present, including a faint white reticle or crosshair at the center of the view, which is not part of the physical scene but appears as a visual aid on the display.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective, with the hands and weapon of the main subject visible at the bottom center and foreground of the frame. Another individual in military gear is positioned ahead, occupying the center to right side of the frame and situated in the middle ground, moving away from the camera down a narrow hallway. The hallway itself extends from the foreground to the background, with walls and portraits visible along the left and right edges. The camera is at the same height as the main subject\u2019s eyes, level with the standing figures. As the explosion occurs, the individual in front jumps left and descends out of the frame, while debris, flames, and smoke rapidly fill the entire field of view, moving from the background and middle ground into the foreground and center. The perspective becomes disoriented as the blast pushes the camera backward, and broken boards, dust, and fire dominate the frame, obscuring clear spatial relationships. Throughout, a faint white reticle remains fixed at the center of the display, overlaying the scene but not interacting with the physical space.",
