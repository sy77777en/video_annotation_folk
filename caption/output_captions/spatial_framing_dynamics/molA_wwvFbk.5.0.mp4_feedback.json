    "pre_caption": "The video showcases an abstract sequence where vibrant light streaks and beams dominate the frame. These elements radiate from a central point located in the middle of the frame, extending outward in all directions. Initially, the light patterns fill the entire frame, creating a dense and immersive visual effect. As the sequence progresses, the camera moves forward, giving the impression of traveling through a tunnel-like structure. The light streaks shift dynamically, with some moving towards the foreground while others recede into the background. The left and right sides of the frame feature vertical lines that appear to be part of the tunnel walls, enhancing the sense of depth. The camera maintains a consistent height, aligned with the central axis of the light patterns, ensuring the viewer remains immersed in the forward motion. The overall spatial dynamics emphasize a continuous flow of light and color, with no discernible changes in the camera's angle or perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an abstract and dynamic display of vibrant colors and light patterns. It includes bright red, purple, and green streaks and beams that intersect and radiate from a central point, creating a sense of movement and energy. The colors blend and shift, with some areas appearing more intense and others more diffused. The overall composition is a kaleidoscope of light, with no discernible objects or figures, emphasizing a visually striking and immersive experience.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a dynamic and abstract scene filled with vibrant colors and light patterns. It features a kaleidoscope of bright red, purple, and orange hues, creating a sense of motion and energy. The environment is undefined, with no discernible natural or architectural elements, focusing instead on the interplay of light and color. The scene transitions smoothly, with streaks of light and color shifting and blending, suggesting movement through a tunnel of light. The overall atmosphere is immersive and visually striking, with a focus on the vivid and fluid visual elements.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
