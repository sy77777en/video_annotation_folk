    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a view from behind a young man with curly, dark brown hair, who is wearing a dark blue and red jacket with a dark blue hood and a white textured interior. As the scene shifts, a second man is revealed more clearly. This man has short, light brown hair, a light brown beard, and is wearing a blue t-shirt underneath a beige apron. He is looking toward the first man and smiling.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a brightly lit kitchen during the day, with white tiled walls and metal shelves stocked with clear and white plastic containers of ingredients. A silver stand mixer rests on a counter, and a magnetic strip on the wall holds several pairs of scissors. A window is visible in the background. Two men are present in the space; one, seen from behind in a dark jacket, interacts with another man who is wearing a blue shirt and a beige apron.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a medium close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a person in a jacket, viewed from behind, occupying the center and right foreground. A second person in an apron is partially visible in the middle ground to the left, with kitchen shelves in the top left background. As the foreground person moves, the camera's focus shifts, transitioning to a medium close-up of the second person, who becomes centered in the middle ground. The first person is now a blurred element in the left foreground, while the background kitchen, with shelves and utensils, is clearly visible behind the second person. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the scene.",
