    "pre_caption": "This screen recording of video editing software displays a video preview window in the top half of the frame and control panels in the bottom half. Within the preview, a close-up of a trench coat sleeve with a patch is positioned in the center-left foreground, while another part of the collar is visible to the right in the middle ground. The camera is level with the coat sleeve. Initially, the bottom of the screen shows a Color Wheels panel on the left and a Scopes panel on the right. The view then changes as the Color Wheels panel is replaced by a Tracker-FX panel. Simultaneously, digital tracking points appear around the patch in the preview window, and a forward tracking operation begins, indicated by a playhead moving across the timeline in the bottom-left panel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up shot shows the collar and upper sleeve of a beige trench coat. A rectangular patch with a dark blue border is affixed to the upper sleeve by two black buttons. The patch features a red and white Union Jack flag design, with the word \"TRENCH\" embroidered in white across its center. Digital tracking points appear around the patch and are connected by blue crosses, forming a rectangle that conforms to the patch's shape. To the right, another section of the collar shows a circular logo with a red and blue design and a white letter 'R' inside.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a video editing software interface shows a project in the color correction workspace. The interface features a video preview window, color wheels, and a Parade waveform scope displaying red, green, and blue channels. In the preview window, a close-up shot of a beige trench coat sleeve is being edited. The sleeve has a rectangular patch with a Union Jack design and the word \"TRENCH\" in white. A tracking tool is used to select this patch, and a forward tracking operation is initiated within the software's tracker panel.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
