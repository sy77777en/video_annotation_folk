    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot where a person's hands are the central focus in the foreground. A yellow cup is held steady in the bottom center of the frame, while a stainless steel pitcher is positioned in the upper left. In the background, a light-colored apron fills the frame. The pitcher pours a stream of milk from the upper left into the center of the cup, creating a white pattern on the coffee's surface. The hands, cup, and pitcher remain in their fixed positions as the pattern develops. The camera is stationary and positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with light skin, wearing a light-colored apron, holds a bright yellow, bowl-shaped ceramic cup with a white interior in their left hand. The cup contains a brown liquid, which is coffee. In their right hand, which has light green painted fingernails, the person holds a small, stainless steel pitcher. They are pouring a stream of white, steamed milk from the pitcher's spout into the coffee, creating an intricate white pattern on the surface of the brown liquid. The pattern develops into a series of stacked, curved lines, characteristic of latte art.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting, a person wearing a light-colored apron holds a round, yellow ceramic cup filled with brown coffee. Using their other hand, they pour white, steamed milk from a stainless steel pitcher into the cup. As the milk is poured, a white, layered pattern begins to form on the surface of the coffee. The person's fingernails are painted a light green color.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
