    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A humanoid figure with white hair, clad in a black suit and white gloves, is seated at a rectangular wooden table, viewed from directly above. This figure has both hands placed on a world map spread across the table. On top of the map, near the figure's right hand, lies a dark photograph depicting what appears to be an underwater scene with a glowing, elongated object. At the top left corner of the table, a black landline telephone rests. Another humanoid figure, dressed in a green uniform, stands partially visible to the right of the seated figure. The seated figure appears to be examining the map and the photograph. Two empty chairs with white seats are positioned on either side of the table, while the seated figure occupies a chair with a red cushioned backrest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is an indoor setting, viewed from an overhead perspective, focusing on a polished wooden table with a blue carpeted floor. On the table, a world map is spread out, and a photograph depicting a glowing object underwater is placed on the top right corner of the map. To the upper left of the map, a black landline telephone is located at the top left corner of the table. A figure with white hair, wearing a black suit and white gloves, is seated at the table, with their hands resting on the map and the photograph. The chair the figure is sitting on has a red backrest. Two chairs with white seats are visible on either side of the figure. Shadows of the table and chairs are cast on the blue carpet, likely from above. Overlay text \"(3);Historicpictoric.com\" appears in the lower left corner of the frame.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows two humanoid subjects at a table. One is standing, wearing a green military uniform, and the other is sitting, wearing a black suit. The sitting one presses a map and a picture on the table, suggesting they are examining the map. The camera is positioned above them, initially showing their full bodies. As the camera moves downward, only parts of their bodies are visible in the lower-right corner of the frame. The video focuses more on the map on the table, keeping it fully visible throughout.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from above, capturing two humanoid figures at a rectangular wooden table. The seated figure, in a black suit, is positioned centrally with both hands on a world map, while the standing figure in a green uniform is partially visible on the right. The camera is positioned above, initially showing their full bodies. As the camera moves downward, the focus shifts to the map, keeping it fully visible, while only parts of the figures remain in the lower-right corner. The map and a photograph on it are central in the frame, with a black landline telephone at the top left of the table. The seated figure's chair with a red backrest is visible, and two empty chairs with white seats are on either side. The camera maintains an overhead perspective throughout, emphasizing the map and table elements.",
