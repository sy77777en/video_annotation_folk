    "pre_caption": "The video captures a first-person perspective of a sled ride along a snow-covered path. The viewer sees the sled's steering wheel and ski-like front in the foreground, positioned centrally at the bottom of the frame. The rider's legs are occasionally visible, extending downward from the top of the frame into the bottom left and right corners. The snowy path stretches ahead, occupying the middle ground and center of the frame, with visible tracks running parallel. Snowbanks line both sides of the path, situated in the left and right middle ground. In the background, a dense forest of evergreen trees stands tall, filling the upper middle and top portions of the frame. The camera remains at the rider's height throughout, maintaining a consistent forward-facing angle as the sled moves steadily along the path. There are no significant changes in the spatial positioning of elements; the scene progresses smoothly, with the sled advancing along the snowy track while the surrounding landscape remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a snowy landscape from a first-person point of view, showing a person riding a sled with a steering wheel and a ski-like front. The casual forward-facing perspective occasionally reveals the rider's legs. The snow-covered path is surrounded by snowbanks and lined with tall evergreen trees, conveying a sense of movement along a snowy track with the sled's tracks visible in the snow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of a snowy outdoor setting, likely a winter landscape. The scene features a snow-covered road flanked by tall snowbanks on either side, with a dense forest of evergreen trees in the background. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cold, cloudy day. The road shows tracks from previous vehicles, indicating recent activity. The viewer's perspective includes parts of a sled or similar vehicle, with a visible steering wheel. The viewer is moving forward along the snowy path. The environment is serene, with the white snow contrasting against the dark green of the trees, creating a stark, wintry atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
