    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is shot from a first-person point of view, showcasing a snowy landscape with tall evergreen trees lining the sides of a snow-covered path. The person is seen operating a sled with a steering wheel. The person is wearing a dark jacket, and their hand is visible on the black, circular steering wheel. The sled has a metallic frame and features a logo with a blue background and white text. Although the sled is stationary, the person appears to be preparing to move along the snowy path.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of a snowy outdoor setting during the day. The scene features a snow-covered road flanked by tall evergreen trees, creating a serene winter landscape. The ground is blanketed in thick snow, with visible tracks indicating recent movement. The sky is overcast, contributing to the cold, wintry atmosphere. As the camera tilts down, a hand is seen gripping the steering wheel of a stationary sled. The environment is quiet and expansive, with the road curving gently through the forested area.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle shot of a snow-covered path in the center, which recedes from the foreground into the background. A snow-covered structure is on the left, and a large snowbank is on the right in the middle ground, with a forest of evergreen trees lining the background. The camera then tilts down, transitioning to a first-person point-of-view. In this new framing, a person's hand holding a black steering wheel occupies the center foreground. The person's legs are visible in the bottom left and bottom right corners. The front of the sled is positioned in the center, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, pointing down the snowy path that now fills the majority of the frame. The camera is positioned from the person's perspective, looking down at the sled and forward along the path.",
