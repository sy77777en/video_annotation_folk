    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a grayscale emblem, centrally positioned against a dark, textured background. The emblem is circular and depicts a hammer and a compass at its center, encircled by a wreath of wheat ears. At the base of the wreath, a tricolor ribbon, rendered in shades of gray, is visible. The emblem is initially illuminated by a bright spotlight from above, creating highlights and shadows that give it a three-dimensional, metallic or stone-like appearance. As the video progresses, the spotlight gradually dims, causing the emblem to fade into the black background until it is no longer visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a grey, metallic emblem of East Germany, featuring a hammer and compass encircled by a wreath of rye, positioned centrally on a dark grey wall over a matching floor. A spotlight from above initially illuminates the emblem, emphasizing its three-dimensional texture and casting shadows. Throughout the video, this spotlight progressively dims, causing the emblem to fade into darkness until the scene is almost entirely black, with only a faint light remaining on the floor beneath where the emblem was highlighted. The overlay text \"[36]\" is visible in the bottom left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a grayscale emblem, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, against a dark wall in the background. A floor surface is visible at the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground towards the middle ground. An overlay text \"[36]\" is consistently visible in the bottom left corner, in the foreground. Initially, a spotlight from above illuminates the emblem. As the video progresses, this spotlight gradually dims, causing the centrally positioned emblem to fade from view and eventually disappear completely. A faint light remains on the floor in the bottom center area after the emblem has vanished. The camera is positioned at the emblem's level.",
