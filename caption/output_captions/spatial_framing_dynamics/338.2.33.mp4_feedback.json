    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a man seated at a table in a restaurant. The man occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground. He is seated directly facing the camera, which is at his eye level. Behind him, in the middle ground, two large, ornate circular archways with intricate designs dominate the background. These archways are symmetrically placed, one on the left and one on the right side of the frame. Within these archways, blurred figures of people can be seen moving around, indicating a busy restaurant environment. The table in front of the man, also in the foreground, holds a neatly folded napkin. Throughout the video, the man remains stationary while the background figures continue to move subtly, creating a dynamic contrast between the stillness of the subject and the activity behind him. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man seated at a table in a restaurant. He has a medium-dark skin tone and is wearing a light yellow polo shirt. His hair is short and dark. The man is facing forward with a calm expression. The table in front of him is set with a folded napkin. In the background, there are other people, slightly blurred, moving around, suggesting a busy restaurant environment. The setting includes ornate decor with a circular design behind the man, adding a decorative element to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting within a warmly lit restaurant, characterized by intricate, circular wooden archways with ornate carvings. The environment is bustling, with blurred figures in the background suggesting movement and activity. The lighting is soft and ambient, casting a cozy glow over the scene. A table is prominently featured in the foreground, set with a neatly folded napkin and simple tableware. The overall atmosphere is inviting, with rich, warm colors and detailed decor contributing to a sense of elegance and cultural richness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
