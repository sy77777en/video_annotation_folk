    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man, who appears to be in his 30s or 40s, is shown in a close-up. He has dark, somewhat messy hair and stubble on his face. He is wearing a dark jacket over a patterned sweater and a light-colored, unbuttoned collared shirt. The left side of his face is illuminated by a light source, highlighting his features and contributing to the dramatic effect of the scene. His face shows a sheen of sweat and a distressed expression with furrowed brows and a downturned mouth as he looks downward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dark, enclosed interior, almost entirely consumed by shadow. A single, direct light source from the side illuminates a man, casting the other half of his face and the background into near-total blackness. In the dimly lit upper right portion of the scene, the faint texture of a wooden surface, possibly a beam or part of the ceiling, is discernible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A man is shown in a static medium close-up shot, positioned in the center-right of the frame and occupying the middle ground. The background is almost entirely dark, with a faintly visible wooden surface in the top right. The camera is positioned at the man's level.",
