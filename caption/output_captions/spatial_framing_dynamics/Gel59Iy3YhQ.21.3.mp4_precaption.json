    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases the gameplay of a pixel-art golf video game from a top-down perspective. The user interface displays information for the 2nd hole, a 650-yard Par 5. In the top left corner, a small avatar of a man with brown hair and a green shirt is shown next to his score of \"E\" and rank of \"2ND.\" The course itself is rendered with green trees, blue water, light brown sand traps, a striped green fairway, and a large area of blue land. A small, pixelated golfer character in a green shirt and brown pants is shown aiming a shot, with a white line indicating the ball's projected path. As the aim is adjusted, the distance to a red flag marker changes. The interface also includes a wind indicator, a slope indicator, a club selection menu showing \"DRIVER\" and \"PRO WOODS,\" and a long power meter at the bottom. In the bottom right corner, a large, white golf ball sits on a tee. The sequence shows the player aiming and then hitting the ball, which travels across the course.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed directly above the character and looks down on them, shows a pixel-art golf course. The course is composed of a striped green fairway, light tan sand traps, and dark blue water hazards, all surrounded by clusters of green trees and bushes. The camera pans to follow the flight of a white golf ball across the landscape, with the ball appearing to grow or shrink to indicate changes in distance. A heads-up display with multiple overlay elements is visible. In the top left corner, text indicates the hole number, par, and total yardage, along with the player's score. The bottom of the screen features the selected club, \"DRIVER,\" and a long power meter. In the top right, indicators show the wind speed and slope. A red flag icon on the course displays the changing distance to the hole.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene is captured from a high-angle, top-down perspective, showing a pixel-art golf course. Initially, a small golfer character is positioned in the center-left of the frame, standing on a sand trap in the middle ground. A heads-up display is overlaid in the foreground, with game information in the top left, club selection in the bottom left, a power meter at the bottom center, and environmental indicators in the top right. As the player aims, the camera pans to the right and zooms out slightly, following the aiming line across the course. After the shot, the camera rapidly pans to the right, tracking the white golf ball as it flies from the center-left toward the upper right of the frame. The camera's movement stops once the ball lands in a sand trap located in the upper right portion of the scene.",
