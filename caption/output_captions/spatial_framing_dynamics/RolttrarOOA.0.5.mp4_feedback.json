    "pre_caption": "This static medium close-up shot is framed from an over-the-shoulder perspective. A man is positioned in the left-center of the frame and in the middle ground, facing right. The back of a woman's head and her right shoulder occupy the right foreground. In the background, a mirror with lights is visible on the far left, while pink curtains are situated in the left-center.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man and a woman in a close interaction. The man, with wet, dark hair, has a slightly reddish-brown skin tone and is wearing a beige jacket over a blue shirt. His expression appears focused and intense as he looks at the woman. The woman, seen from behind, has long brown hair, but her skin color is challenging to determine from the video. Her face is not visible, but she is positioned close to the man, suggesting a conversation or confrontation. The setting is intimate, with personal items visible around them, indicating a private space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective, focusing on a character's upper body and the room ahead. The environment is a softly lit room with pastel-colored walls adorned with various decorations, including plush items and framed pictures. A window with sheer curtains allows diffused light to enter, creating a warm ambiance. The character in the middleground has wet hair, suggesting recent exposure to rain or water, and wears a light-colored jacket over a blue shirt. This detail enhances the intimate and personal atmosphere of the setting, with the character's expression and posture indicating a moment of interaction or conversation.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
