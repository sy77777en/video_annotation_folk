    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an aquatic interior scenery shot, capturing a view from a level angle at the surface of murky, green water within an enclosed tank. The environment is defined by stark, white-tiled walls under the bright, diffuse light of several small, high windows. The shot lacks a singular main subject, as the immersive viewpoint emphasizes the claustrophobic atmosphere and the unsettling quality of the confined space itself. The focus is on the overall environment rather than on the dark, curved form breaking the rippling surface in the foreground or the red and white object floating in the distance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a view from the surface of murky, greenish water within an enclosed space. The room's walls are lined with white rectangular tiles, and bright, diffuse light enters through several small, high windows. The water's surface is disturbed by ripples. In the immediate foreground, multiple inflatable toys of various colors float through the water, adding a playful touch to the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide scenery shot is framed from a low, water-level perspective, positioning the viewer at the surface of murky green water that fills the bottom half of the frame. In the background, white-tiled walls occupy the upper half, with several small, bright windows positioned near the top of the frame. A dark, curved form is visible in the bottom foreground, while a red and white object floats in the middle ground on the right. The camera bobs slightly with the water's ripples, maintaining a relatively stable position throughout the shot.",
