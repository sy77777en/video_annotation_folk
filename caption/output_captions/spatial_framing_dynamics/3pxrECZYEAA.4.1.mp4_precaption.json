    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up on the dark green, silhouetted forms of pine trees. The view then pulls back to reveal a stylized, bright red bird with large, outstretched wings flying upwards. The bird emerges from a vast forest of green, stylized trees covering rolling hills. As the bird continues to fly away into a light blue sky with white clouds, a winding, orange-brown road becomes visible in the valley below.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a 2D animated landscape, the scene begins with a close-up of dark green, stylized pine trees before the camera moves upward to reveal a vast, hilly terrain. The rolling green hills are covered in forests, and a single, winding orange-brown road runs through a valley. A red, bird-like creature with large wings ascends from the treetops, flying higher into the bright blue daytime sky, which is dotted with a few white, fluffy clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a wide shot of the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme close-up of dark green tree silhouettes that fill the entire frame. The camera then pulls back and tilts up, revealing a red bird that emerges from the center foreground and flies upward. As the camera continues to move back, the shot transitions into a wide shot, showing a landscape of green, forested hills in the middle ground and a blue sky with clouds in the background. The bird continues to fly up and away from a high angle, moving from the center to the top center of the frame and shrinking as it recedes into the background. A winding orange road appears in the middle ground valley, which occupies the bottom half of the frame, while the sky fills the top half.",
