    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a quiet residential neighborhood on a rainy day. The focus is on the broad, wet streets lined with modern houses, parked cars, and lush green hedges, all under a soft, overcast sky that diffuses the light and enhances the tranquil atmosphere. There is no main subject because the emphasis is on the overall environment and mood, highlighting the calmness and scale of the urban setting rather than any specific object or individual.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moves through a quiet residential neighborhood outdoors on a rainy day. The streets are wet, with smooth pavement reflecting the overcast sky and muted daylight. Modern houses with light and dark facades line both sides of the road, some with small, neatly trimmed green hedges and others with stone or tile accents. Utility poles and wires run parallel to the street, and several parked cars in shades of red, black, and silver are visible along the curb and in driveways. The sidewalks are bordered by low curbs and occasional patches of greenery, while the rain creates a subtle sheen on all surfaces, enhancing the subdued, cool-toned color palette of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a quiet residential neighborhood on a rainy day, capturing the entire breadth of the street and surrounding houses. Initially, the camera focuses on a wet street extending into the distance, with utility poles and wires running along the left side and modern houses on the right. As the camera pans to the right, it reveals more of the street, showing parked cars in various colors along the curb and in driveways. The houses, with their light and dark facades, are positioned in the middle ground, while the parked cars occupy the foreground. The camera remains at eye level throughout, providing a consistent perspective of the scene. The transition from the initial view of the street to the broader view of the neighborhood is smooth, maintaining the same wide shot size and gradually revealing more elements within the frame. The overall spatial composition emphasizes the tranquility and scale of the urban setting.",
