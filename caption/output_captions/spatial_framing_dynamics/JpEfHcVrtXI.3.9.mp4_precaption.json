    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark environment, a small, child-like figure is illuminated by a light source it appears to hold. The figure is clad in a bright yellow raincoat with a prominent, pointed hood that completely obscures its face and head. Scattered on the floor around this figure are several black, amorphous shapes that resemble puddles of a thick, dark liquid or small, shadowy creatures.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person 3D game video captures a small figure in a bright yellow raincoat running through a pitch-black indoor space. The figure is the sole source of light, casting a moving circle of illumination onto a dark, planked floor. This light reveals wet patches and amorphous dark shapes on the ground, while the rest of the environment remains in deep shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide, high-angle shot, a small figure in a yellow raincoat is initially positioned in the center-middle ground. A large, black, amorphous shape occupies the left foreground, while several smaller black shapes are scattered on the floor in the middle ground around the figure. The figure runs from the center toward the right side of the frame, staying in the middle ground. The light it carries moves with it, illuminating a wet patch in the center and briefly revealing a can-like object in the bottom right middle ground as it moves past. The camera remains static throughout the scene.",
