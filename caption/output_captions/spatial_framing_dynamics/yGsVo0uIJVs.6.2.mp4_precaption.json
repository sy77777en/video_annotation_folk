    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large, industrial ship navigating through the ocean. The ship is characterized by its dark hull with a red waterline and a series of white superstructures on deck. A prominent feature is the tall, yellow lattice tower positioned centrally, likely used for drilling or similar operations. The ship's deck is equipped with various equipment and structures, including containers, indicating its utilitarian purpose. The vessel is oriented with its bow facing forward, cutting through the waves, suggesting movement and purpose.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV shot, showcases an expansive ocean setting during daylight. The scene features a large ship with a prominent tower structure, likely a drilling rig, positioned centrally in the vast blue sea. The ship is characterized by its dark hull and white superstructure, with the tower displaying a metallic framework. The ocean's surface is slightly rippled, indicating calm weather conditions. The sky is clear, enhancing the visibility of the ship and the surrounding water. An overlay element, located in the bottom left corner, contains the number [2] and is not integrated into the scene or obstructing the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a large industrial ship in the ocean. Initially, the camera is positioned above the ship, capturing its entire length and breadth. The ship occupies the center of the frame, with its bow pointing towards the bottom right and its stern towards the top left. The yellow lattice tower stands prominently in the middle of the ship, both in the 2D center and in the middle ground of the scene. The ship's dark hull and white superstructures are clearly visible against the blue ocean. As the video progresses, the camera gradually descends to the ship's level, maintaining the ship's central position in the frame. Throughout the sequence, the ship remains stationary relative to the camera, with no significant changes in its orientation or position within the frame. The ocean surrounds the ship in all directions, forming the background of the scene. The camera's transition from above to the ship's level provides a dynamic shift in perspective while keeping the ship as the focal point.",
