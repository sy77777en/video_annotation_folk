    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a nighttime aerial cityscape shot, beginning with a high, out-of-focus perspective that captures the sprawling urban expanse as a glittering field of bokeh lights against the dark sky. The camera then descends and tilts, gradually bringing a specific multi-lane street into focus. This thoroughfare is illuminated by streetlights and the glowing signs of low-rise commercial buildings, with a few cars moving along its length. The shot lacks a central subject, instead emphasizing the vast, atmospheric quality of the city at night, using the patterns of light and shadow to establish a sense of place and scale.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone descends over a city at night, initially showing a wide, blurry expanse of multicolored city lights against a black sky. As the drone moves lower, the view comes into focus, revealing a street grid below. A main road with several lanes runs through the scene, populated by a few moving cars with white headlights and red taillights. The streets are lined with low-rise buildings, some of which have illuminated signs and windows, casting a glow onto the dark asphalt.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video features an extreme wide shot of a nighttime cityscape, with the scenery itself being the primary focus. The shot begins from a high-angle, out-of-focus perspective, showing the city as a vast expanse of blurred, multicolored lights scattered across the entire frame against a dark background. The camera then descends and tilts downward, causing the scene to gradually sharpen. The shot resolves into a clearer high-angle view, where a multi-lane street in the middle ground runs diagonally from the upper-middle part of the frame toward the bottom right. This street is flanked by low-rise buildings, and a few cars are visible moving along it.",
