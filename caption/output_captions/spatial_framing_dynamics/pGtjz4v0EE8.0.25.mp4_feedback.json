    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot of a church interior. Initially, an ornate chapel is positioned in the center background, with its gilded dome occupying the top center of the frame and an altarpiece below it. This chapel is flanked by dark marble columns in the middle ground. A red brick wall is visible in the left middle ground, and a large column stands in the left foreground. On the right, a marble wall with statuary is in the middle ground. The camera then pans to the left while simultaneously moving to the right. This motion causes the central chapel to shift toward the left side of the frame, while revealing more of the sculpted marble wall on the right. The camera is positioned at roughly eye level, angled slightly upward.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an interior scenery shot capturing the opulent and reverent atmosphere of a grand European church or cathedral. The camera slowly pans across the vast space, revealing a stunning display of architectural and artistic detail, from massive, dark marble columns and sections of exposed red brick to the elaborate white marble sculptures and reliefs adorning the walls. The primary focus is a deeply recessed chapel or apse, crowned with a magnificent, gilded dome featuring intricate patterns and figures. Below, a large, dramatic altarpiece painting is enshrined within an elaborate white marble framework, set above what appears to be a reliquary. There is no main subject, as the video's purpose is to immerse the viewer in the overwhelming scale, historical grandeur, and sacred ambiance of the environment itself, with ornate lanterns casting a warm glow that highlights the rich textures throughout the space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The interior of an ornate church features a lavishly decorated chapel set within a grand archway. The chapel's domed ceiling is gilded and coffered, with a large, dark painting serving as the altarpiece, framed in white sculpted stone. Below the painting rests a glass sarcophagus. Polished, dark marble columns stand on either side of the chapel. The wall to the left is exposed red brick, while the wall to the right is adorned with marble panels and statuary. The scene is illuminated by warm light from hanging lanterns and the white light streaming in from outside the window, which highlights the intricate gold and marble details, as the view pans slowly to the left while moving to the right, revealing more of the elaborate stonework along the church wall.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
