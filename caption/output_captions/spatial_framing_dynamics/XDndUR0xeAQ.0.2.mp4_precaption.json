    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An extremely muscular, light-skinned man with long, reddish-brown hair stands facing forward. He has a prominent jawline and a smug expression with squinted eyes. He is wearing a tight-fitting black short-sleeved shirt with white bands on the sleeves, black pants, and a pair of red boxing gloves on his hands. The perspective is from a low angle, looking up at him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors within a long, narrow aisle flanked by two towering, dark brown wooden bookshelves. These shelves are densely packed with books, extending high towards the ceiling. Overhead, rectangular fluorescent lights are recessed into the ceiling, casting a bright, downward glow. The camera's perspective starts from a low angle, looking up at a muscular figure in red boxing gloves, before tilting upwards to frame the individual's upper body as he stand prominently in the center of the aisle.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle shot centered on a man's lower torso and arms. His red-gloved fists are in the foreground, positioned at the bottom left and bottom right of the frame. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning to a medium shot that frames his upper body and head in the center. Throughout the shot, tall bookshelves are visible on the left and right sides, extending from the foreground into the background, while fluorescent lights are positioned at the top of the frame in the background. The camera maintains its low-angle perspective, looking up at the subject.",
