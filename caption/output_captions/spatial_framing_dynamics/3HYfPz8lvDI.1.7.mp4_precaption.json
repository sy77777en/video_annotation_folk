    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It focuses on the architectural design and scale of a modern building, characterized by its tall, imposing structure and numerous vertical lines created by windows and panels. The emphasis is on the building's height and geometric patterns, rather than a specific object or subject, highlighting the urban environment and atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases an outdoor urban setting featuring a towering modern skyscraper with a sleek, geometric design. The building's facade is composed of vertical lines and reflective glass panels, creating a pattern of alternating dark and light sections. The structure rises dramatically against a blue sky with visible clouds, suggesting a partly cloudy day. The scene is captured from a worm's eye view, emphasizing the height and imposing nature of the architecture. Overlay elements include bold white text centered on the screen, initially displaying the title \"Solar Convergence\" in a larger size, which then becomes smaller as \"SOLAR DEATH RAYS\" appears below it. These overlays are not part of the physical scene but provide contextual information.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, static scenery shot focusing on a modern skyscraper. The building is captured from a low-angle, worm's-eye view, with its facade filling the frame from the bottom edge and converging towards the top center. The skyscraper occupies the foreground and middle ground of the scene. In the background, a small portion of the sky is visible at the top of the frame. White text reading \"Solar Convergence\" appears in the center of the frame, followed by the text \"SOLAR DEATH RAYS\" appearing below it, also in the center. The camera is positioned significantly below the building, looking directly upwards.",
