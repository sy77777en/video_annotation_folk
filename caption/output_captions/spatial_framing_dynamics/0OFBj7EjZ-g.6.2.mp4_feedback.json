    "pre_caption": "This high-angle wide shot centers on a large, cylindrical water tank in the middle ground. A person is suspended horizontally in the upper-center of the tank, with a group of fish swimming below them in the bottom-center. In the background, the building's atrium floor is visible at the bottom of the frame, with a Christmas tree on the bottom right and another partially visible on the bottom left. The camera then slowly pulls back and up, transitioning the scene into an extreme wide shot that reveals more of the multi-story building, causing the central tank and the person inside to appear smaller within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing light-colored clothing is suspended horizontally in the middle of a massive, cylindrical water tank. The person is seen from a high angle, floating away from the camera with their limbs slightly outstretched. Below them, several elongated, greenish-yellow fish swim in a small group.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, the scene captures the interior of a multi-story building's atrium, illuminated by warm, artificial light. At the center of the space stands a massive, cylindrical aquarium with a dark gold metallic band around its upper rim. The tank is filled with blue water, where a person is seen floating near the surface, and several fish swim closer to the bottom. The surrounding atrium features a light-colored tiled floor, and on each side, a decorated Christmas tree is visible, totaling two trees. The camera slowly pulls back, revealing more of the building's architecture with its multiple levels of interior windows overlooking the central space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
