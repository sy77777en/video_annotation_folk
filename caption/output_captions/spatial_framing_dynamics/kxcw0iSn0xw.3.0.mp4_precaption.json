    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with light skin and short, dark hair, wearing a backward dark cap. He is dressed in a dark blue T-shirt with visible wet stains on the front that reflect sunlight. The man has his eyes closed tightly and is broadly grinning, showing his teeth. His facial expression suggests he is bracing for impact or reacting to something. In the second part of the video, a pink substance is seen splattering on his left face, adding to the stains on his shirt. The man remains in the same position throughout, with his head slightly tilted back.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting with a few leafy trees during the daytime. The environment features a person standing centrally, with a playful expression, as a burst of pink material, appearing wetter and somewhat solid, surrounds them, suggesting a dynamic and lively moment. The person's dark clothing contrasts with the vibrant colors of the pink material and the greenery, adding visual interest. The overall atmosphere is bright and energetic, with the natural elements and the colorful burst creating a vivid and engaging scene, despite the background being out of focus.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium close-up shot centers on a man positioned in the middle ground of the frame. Behind him, a background of green trees is out of focus. A pink substance enters the frame from the right and travels horizontally toward the center, splattering on the man's face. The camera remains static and is positioned at the man's level throughout the shot.",
