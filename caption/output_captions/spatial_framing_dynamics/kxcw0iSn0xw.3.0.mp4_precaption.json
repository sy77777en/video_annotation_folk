    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with light skin and short, dark hair, wearing a backward dark cap. He is dressed in a dark blue T-shirt with visible wet and reflective stains on the front, likely due to sunlight. The man has his eyes closed tightly and is smiling broadly, showing his teeth. His facial expression suggests he is bracing for impact or reacting to something. In the second part of the video, a pink substance is seen splattering on the left side of his face, adding to the stains on his shirt. The man remains in the same position throughout, with his head slightly tilted back.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting with a few leafy trees during the daytime. The environment features a person standing centrally, with a playful expression, as a burst of pink material, appearing wetter and somewhat solid, surrounds them, suggesting a dynamic and lively moment. The person's dark clothing contrasts with the vibrant colors of the pink material and the greenery, adding visual interest. The overall atmosphere is bright and energetic, with the natural elements and the colorful burst creating a vivid and engaging scene, despite the background being out of focus.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a man, capturing him from the chest up. Positioned centrally in the frame, the man occupies the foreground, with his body facing forward. His head is slightly tilted back, and his eyes are closed. A pink substance splatters onto the left side of his face, spreading across his features and dripping down his shirt. This action occurs dynamically, with the substance visibly impacting his face and scattering droplets around him. The background consists of leafy trees, which remain out of focus, placing the man firmly in the foreground. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's eye level throughout the sequence, ensuring the man remains the focal point. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning, keeping the viewer's attention fixed on the man's reaction and the splattering substance.",
