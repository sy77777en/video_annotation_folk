    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features four men outdoors. The leftmost man, with dark curly hair and a full dark beard, is wearing a light grey t-shirt and black shorts. He initially holds a red water balloon, which he throws. To his right, a man with short brown hair and glasses, dressed in a white t-shirt and dark shorts with a small logo, throws a blue water balloon. In the middle, a man with dark hair and a full dark beard, wearing a white t-shirt with a dark graphic print and dark green shorts, throws an orange water balloon into the air. On the far right, a man wearing a red baseball cap backward, a blue t-shirt with a graphic, and dark shorts, holds a knife with both hands and pops the red water balloon thrown by the leftmost man, causing water to spray.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a paved area, under a bright sky with a dense backdrop of green trees. Four men are present. Colorful water balloons\u2014red, blue, and orange\u2014are visible. One man, holding a knife, is positioned to interact with a red water balloon that is thrown towards him. Other balloons are tossed into the air, and the red balloon bursts, creating a visible splash of water.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium full shot with four men positioned across the middle ground. On the left, a man initially holds a red water balloon. To his right, in the center-left, a second man holds a blue water balloon. In the center, a third man holds an orange water balloon. On the far right, a fourth man holds a knife, facing the others. The man on the left throws the red balloon horizontally from left to right towards the man on the right. Concurrently, the men in the center-left and center throw their blue and orange balloons upwards; these balloons ascend from their respective positions towards the top of the frame. The man on the right intercepts the incoming red balloon with the knife, causing it to burst and spray water in the right portion of the middle ground. A paved area occupies the foreground and middle ground, with dense green trees forming the background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
