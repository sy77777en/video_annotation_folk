    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a flush toilet. The toilet bowl is positioned in the bottom left foreground. The tank is in the center middle ground, with its lid levitating directly above it in the top center middle ground. Bright blue water is visible inside the tank, also in the center middle ground, and a white flush handle is on the tank's right side, in the center-right middle ground. White text \"Flush toilet\" is overlaid in the bottom left foreground, while a blurred white object is in the top left background. As the shot transitions towards a full shot, the camera appears to pull back slightly, causing the entire toilet assembly to shift slightly towards the bottom left of the frame, revealing more of the bowl. Simultaneously, the blue water begins to flow from the tank down into the toilet bowl. The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a white/light gray flush toilet with a partially transparent or cutaway view. The toilet features a bowl with the seat down and a rectangular tank positioned above and behind the bowl. The lid of the tank is shown levitating above it, revealing the tank's interior filled with bright blue water. As the camera moves, you can observe the flow of blue water from the rectangular tank into the toilet bowl. A white flush handle is visible on the right side of the tank, and the overall appearance suggests a ceramic or similar smooth material for the toilet's construction.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a stylized, translucent gray flush toilet against a dark gray background with very dim lighting. The toilet tank is partially filled with bright blue, opaque water. The white, rectangular tank lid is shown levitating above the tank and appears to hover without lowering. In the bottom left corner, white text overlay reads \"[1,2,3,4] Flush toilet\". There is a blurred white object in the upper left corner of the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
