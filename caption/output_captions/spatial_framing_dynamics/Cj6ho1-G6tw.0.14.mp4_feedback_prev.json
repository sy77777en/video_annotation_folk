    "pre_caption": "A full shot displays a seagull in the foreground, positioned in the center-left of the frame, perched on a wooden structure that occupies the bottom-left quadrant. In the middle ground, another seagull stands centrally, situated behind the main subject and in front of a low stone wall that stretches horizontally across the frame. A grey utility box is visible in the middle ground on the right side of the scene. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a seagull perched on a wooden railing. The seagull has a white head and body with gray wings, and its beak is yellow. It is standing with its body slightly angled, occasionally opening its beak. In the background, another seagull is visible, positioned further away and appearing smaller due to the distance. The primary seagull's posture and actions are the main focus, with its distinct coloring and features clearly visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene is set at a harbor or pier during the day under an overcast sky. A white and grey seagull with a yellow beak stands on the edge of a reddish-brown wooden structure, its beak open. In the blurred background, another white seagull is visible, along with a low stone wall and a metal railing. To the right, a grey utility box is mounted on a post.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
