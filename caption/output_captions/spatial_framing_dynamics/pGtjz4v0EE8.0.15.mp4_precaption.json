    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures the vibrant diversity of St. Mark's Square in Venice, showcasing a bustling cityscape filled with tourists of various ethnicities. The camera's broad, panning view highlights the grand scale of the historic architecture and the lively atmosphere. On a bright, sunny day, the magnificent facade of St. Mark's Basilica stands in the background, partially obscured by white scaffolding, while the distinctive Gothic architecture of the Doge's Palace extends to the right with its elegant colonnade. The square is teeming with people in colorful and varied styles, some admiring the buildings, others walking through the crowd, and a few gathered around a souvenir cart selling vibrant t-shirts and hats.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On a sunny day in St. Mark's Square in Venice, Italy, crowds of tourists walk around the open plaza. As the camera moves forward, St. Mark's Basilica appears prominently in the middle ground, showcasing its domes and detailed facade, partially covered by white scaffolding. When the camera pulls back, the Basilica shifts to the background, revealing other buildings in the left background. To the right, the long, white colonnade of the Doge's Palace extends along the square. The scene includes a souvenir stand selling t-shirts and other trinkets amidst the pedestrians. The video captures different perspectives of the bustling square, filled with people under a clear blue sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a bustling city square populated by numerous people. Initially, a souvenir cart is located in the center-left foreground, with tourists occupying the foreground and middle ground. In the background, a large basilica is visible in the center-left, partially covered by scaffolding, while a long, arched building extends across the right background. The scene then cuts to a wider shot from a different position. In this new framing, a metal railing appears in the left foreground, with the crowd now situated in the middle ground. The basilica is positioned more centrally in the background, with the arched building to its right and another building to its left. The camera is positioned at approximately eye level with the people in the square.",
