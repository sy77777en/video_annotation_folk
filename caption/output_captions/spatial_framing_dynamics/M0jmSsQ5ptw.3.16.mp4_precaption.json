    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man wearing a tan hooded jacket, black pants, and a grey beanie with goggles pushed up onto it walks toward a helicopter while carrying a snowboard with a red and yellow design. He steps up into the open side door of the helicopter and sits down on a black bench seat, facing the camera and looking toward the side. The helicopter has a distinctive and colorful wrap; its front is yellow, while the main body and tail are covered in a busy, graffiti-style pattern of red, white, and dark blue or black. The \"Red Bull\" logo is featured prominently in red text on the side of the aircraft.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On a paved airfield marked with blue lines, a person in a tan hooded jacket and black pants walks toward a helicopter with its rotors in motion. The helicopter features a vibrant, graffiti-style wrap in red, white, and blue with prominent Red Bull branding, contrasted by a black and white nose, while the area surrounding the cockpit is yellow. The individual, carrying a snowboard, steps onto the landing skid and enters the open side door of the aircraft. The setting is outdoors under a cloudy sky, with a background of dry, grassy fields and distant mountains.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a man with a snowboard begins in the center foreground, walking toward a helicopter positioned in the middle ground, which is angled from the center-right toward the top-left of the frame. In the background, mountains are visible under a cloudy sky. As the man walks, the camera follows him, and he moves toward the center-left of the frame to step into the helicopter's open door. The shot tightens as he enters, with the final composition showing him sitting in the middle ground inside the helicopter, which now occupies the left and center of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the sequence.",
