    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman standing on rocks in a shallow stream. She is wearing a white T-shirt and light blue jeans, with short hair. The woman is facing to the right and appears to be in a mid-step position, suggesting movement or balance. Her posture is slightly bent forward, and she is looking down towards the water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a forest with moderate brightness due to tree cover, a person stands on the rocks beside a shallow, flowing creek. The surrounding environment is dense with green trees and foliage, with the ground covered in dirt and rocks. The scene is presented with a grainy, vintage film quality and is framed by black borders. Animated, hand-drawn overlays appear throughout the clip; a red, squiggly line traces the person's form, and blue and white scribbles are drawn over the water's surface.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a full shot of a woman positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground, standing on rocks beside a stream that occupies the foreground. The dense forest fills the background, with another person visible in the distant middle ground to the left. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. Throughout the shot, animated elements appear and disappear; first, a red, squiggly line traces the woman's form, and later, blue and white scribbles are drawn over the water in the foreground.",
