    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective through a green-tinted night-vision scope, a soldier holds a rifle equipped with a holographic sight. In front of them, another soldier, identified by on-screen text as Captain Price, wears a helmet, a tactical vest, and a backpack with a rifle attached. Captain Price uses bolt cutters to break a chain on a wire mesh gate and then pushes it open. After moving through the gate, they cautiously advance into a grassy area where several other armed figures, identified as Al-Qatala fighters, are seen in the distance near a building and a vehicle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, shows a nighttime scene through a green-tinted night vision display. The view is initially focused on another soldier in tactical gear who is using bolt cutters to break a chain on a tall, wire-mesh gate. After the gate is opened, the characters move forward into an overgrown, grassy area with trees in the background and a building on the left. The scene is overlaid with a heads-up display (HUD) that includes a vertical scale on the left and an ammunition count on the bottom right. White text subtitles appear as an overlay at the bottom of the screen, displaying dialogue, with the friendly character's name, Prince, in green, and the enemy's name, AI-Qatala Fighter 4, in red.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective at eye level, a rifle with a holographic sight occupies the bottom foreground. In the middle ground, another soldier is positioned in the center-left, cutting a chain on a wire mesh gate that extends across the frame. After cutting the chain, the soldier pushes the gate open to the right and moves forward. The camera follows, advancing through the gate into a grassy area. The soldier remains in the center middle ground, while a building appears on the left. In the middle-to-background area on the left, several other figures become visible near the building and a vehicle. The camera continues to move forward and pans slightly left, keeping the lead soldier in the center of the frame while observing the distant figures.",
