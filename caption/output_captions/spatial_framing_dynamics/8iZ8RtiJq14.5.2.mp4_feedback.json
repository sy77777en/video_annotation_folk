    "pre_caption": "This is a static shot. In the foreground, a beige, slatted panel is positioned on the left, occupying the left third of the frame and remaining in sharp focus. In the middle ground, a person sits on a light brown couch. The person is positioned to the right of the frame's center and is partially obscured by the foreground panel. The couch extends from the center to the right edge of the frame. The entire middle ground, including the person and the couch, is blurred. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing them in a medium shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A beige, slatted panel on the left is in sharp focus, partially obscuring the background. In the blurred background, a person sits on a light brown couch. This individual wears a light-colored, long-sleeved top and dark pants. Their head is brightly illuminated, creating a glowing effect that obscures any facial details.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space, viewed from behind a light-colored panel with horizontal slats on the left. In the blurred background, a light-colored sofa with cushions rests against a dark wall. A figure is seated on the sofa, wearing a light-colored long-sleeved top and dark pants, with a bright, white light glowing intensely from their head area.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person sitting on a couch in the background, with nearly half of their body covered by a wall-like object in the foreground. The focus is on the part of the object, leaving the person blurred.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
