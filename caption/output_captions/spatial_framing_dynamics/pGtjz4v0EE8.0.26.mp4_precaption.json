    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, focusing on the overall atmosphere and environment rather than a specific main subject. The scene is a time-lapse of the ancient Colosseum in Rome, which stands majestically illuminated by warm, golden lights against a dark twilight sky. A wide-angle, fisheye lens creates a sweeping, distorted perspective that enhances the grandeur of the architecture. In the foreground, the constant motion of city life is represented by long, flowing streaks of white, yellow, and red light from passing vehicles, creating a stark and beautiful contrast between the fast-paced present and the enduring historical monument.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A night time-lapse captures the Colosseum in Rome from a low, wide-angle roadside perspective. The ancient stone amphitheater is illuminated from below by warm, golden lights that highlight its tiered arches against a deep blue and black sky. In the foreground, long, bright streaks of white, yellow, and red light from moving traffic flow along the curved road. A streetlight on the right side of the scene casts an orange glow on the pavement and sidewalk, where a few people can be seen walking. Trees are visible in the background on the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot with no specific main subject, focusing on the overall environment. The shot begins with a fast motion blur of light streaks moving from left to right, which quickly resolves into a stable, low-angle time-lapse. In this view, the illuminated Colosseum is positioned in the middle ground, occupying the center and left of the frame. A road with flowing light streaks from traffic curves across the foreground from the bottom left to the bottom right. A tall streetlight stands in the foreground on the right side of the frame, while the dark sky and distant trees occupy the background at the top and far right. The camera remains stationary at a low height throughout the time-lapse.",
