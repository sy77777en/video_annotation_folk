    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a medium close-up shot that circles two individuals, a man with clown-like makeup holds a woman. The man has white face paint, dark, smudged makeup around his eyes, a smeared red smile that extends into scars on his cheeks, greasy, shoulder-length green hair, and is wearing a purple suit jacket with black leather gloves. The woman has brown hair styled in an updo and wears a dark top. The video begins with the back of the woman's head obscuring the man. As the camera moves, it reveals the man holding a small knife to the woman's cheek. The camera continues to rotate, showing the man's back to the camera and then settling on a view of the woman's face over his shoulder.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place indoors at night, within a dimly lit room during what appears to be a formal gathering. Large windows in the background reveal a dark city skyline with distant lights. In the background of the room, other guests are visible in soft focus, and a table is set with a white tablecloth and a floral centerpiece. The overall lighting is low, casting the environment in shadow.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot begins with the woman's head blocking the clown. As the camera rotates around the two of them, the woman is on the left side of the frame and the clown is on the right. The shot then transitions as the clown's back blocks the woman, and finally, the shot shows the woman on the right side through the clown's shoulder. Overall, it is a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The shot begins as a medium close-up, with the back of a woman's head in the foreground, obscuring a man behind her. The camera then circles the two subjects from left to right. As it moves, the man is revealed on the right side of the frame, holding the woman, who is positioned on the left. The camera continues its rotation, causing the man's back to move to the center-foreground and temporarily block the woman from view. The shot concludes with the camera positioned over the man's left shoulder, framing the woman's face on the right side of the screen. Throughout this movement, out-of-focus guests and a table are visible in the middle ground, with a dark city skyline in the far background. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level.",
