    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black and tan German Shepherd is shown in a horizontal orientation, suspended in mid-air and remaining still. A visual effect creates the appearance of a pole that vertically divides the frame in the middle. Positioned to the left of the dog is a child with short, dark hair, wearing a purple long-sleeved shirt and blue pants. The child stands with both arms raised toward the dog, as if assisting or spotting the animal.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene takes place in a room with white walls and a staircase visible in the background. A vertical pole, appearing as a visual effect, divides the frame in the middle. A dog is stationary near the pole, while a person in a purple garment stands to the left with arms raised. The environment is dimly lit, giving the grainy footage a greenish-yellow color cast. Several red rectangular objects with black-and-white patterns are affixed to the walls. The video is presented within a black frame overlay.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera frames a child and a dog, beginning with a middle shot of the child\u2019s body alongside a full shot of the dog. As the camera cranes upward, the framing gradually expands until both the child and the dog are captured together in a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle middle shot, framing a child in the bottom left foreground and a full shot of a dog suspended mid-air in the center of the frame. A vertical pole effect bisects the center of the frame, appearing to be in the same plane as the dog. In the background, red rectangular objects are visible on the wall in the top left, while a staircase occupies the background on the right. The camera then cranes upward, causing the framing to expand into a full shot that captures both the child on the left and the dog in the center. This movement also shifts the camera's perspective from a low angle to a position at the subjects' level.",
