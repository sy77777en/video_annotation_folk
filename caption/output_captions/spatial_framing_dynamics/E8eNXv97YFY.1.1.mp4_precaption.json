    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, featuring a large, reddish-brown stone monument with a multi-tiered, pagoda-style roof. The monument is centrally framed against a dynamic, time-lapse sky filled with fast-moving clouds that partially obscure a bright, hazy sun. In the background, a modern city skyline with several buildings provides a contrasting backdrop. There is no single main subject, as the shot's composition emphasizes the overall atmosphere and grand scale, focusing on the relationship between the imposing monument, the turbulent sky, and the surrounding urban environment rather than on a specific object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse video shows the Independence Monument in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, against a dramatic sky. The large, reddish-brown stone monument, designed with a multi-tiered, ornate roof in a traditional Khmer style, stands at the center of a public space. In the middleground and background, the modern city skyline includes several buildings and skyscrapers. The scene is set during late afternoon or early evening, as the sun, partially obscured, casts a glow behind fast-moving clouds that sweep across the sky. A few small figures of people can be seen on and around the monument's stepped base, which is flanked by small trees and flags.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, low-angle scenery shot. A large, reddish-brown stone monument is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The sky, filled with fast-moving clouds, fills the top half of the frame in the background, with a bright, hazy sun located in the top right. In the background, a city skyline with buildings is visible on the left and right sides of the central monument. Small trees and flags are positioned in the foreground and middle ground at the bottom left and bottom right, framing the scene. A few small figures of people are visible in the bottom center on the monument's base. The camera remains static, capturing a time-lapse of the clouds sweeping across the sky.",
