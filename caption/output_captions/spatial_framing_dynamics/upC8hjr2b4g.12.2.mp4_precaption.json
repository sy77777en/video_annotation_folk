    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man wearing a white lab coat, blue pants, a white shirt, and a belt, with short dark hair and sunglasses. He is positioned on the right side of the frame, facing forward. His left arm and hand are open, while his right hand is extended with the index finger pointing, as if indicating something. The man lacks facial features, and there is a white, geometric statue of a human figure resembling a classical bust positioned to the left, but the man is not facing it. The scene suggests a contemplative or analytical interaction.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit, undefined indoor space with a muted, greenish-gray color palette. A spotlight from above illuminates two figures. On the left, a white, low-poly, mannequin-like figure stands in profile, facing right. To the right and slightly in front of it, a more detailed, human-like figure in a white lab coat, white collared shirt, and blue trousers stands facing slightly left. This figure wears round glasses, has dark hair, and holds its right index finger extended in front of its head, as if pointing at something. The left hand is open and facing forward. Overlay text \"[26]\" is located at the bottom left of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium full shot. A man in a lab coat is positioned on the right side of the frame in the middle ground. To his left and slightly further back in the middle ground, a white geometric statue of a human figure is visible. The shot then transitions to a medium shot, bringing the subjects closer in the frame while maintaining their relative positions. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout.",
