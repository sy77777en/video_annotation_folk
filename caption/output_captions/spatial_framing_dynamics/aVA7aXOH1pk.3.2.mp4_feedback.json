    "pre_caption": "A medium shot, captured from a low angle, frames a central man in the middle ground with his right fist raised toward the top of the frame. In the foreground and slightly to the left of center, a woman is bent over. To the right of the central man, another man in sunglasses occupies the middle ground on the right side of the frame, while a fourth person is partially visible in the middle ground on the far left.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with blond hair, wearing a dark suit jacket over a white collared shirt, stands with his right fist raised. His face appears to have blood on the right side and around his open mouth. In front of him, a woman with blond hair tied back in a ponytail, also in a dark jacket, is bent over with her head down. To the right side of the frame, another man with short brown hair, wearing sunglasses, a dark suit, and a white collared shirt, is visible. A fourth individual, a man in sunglasses and a dark suit, is partially visible on the far left of the frame. In the background, an American flag hangs from cables suspended by a pole against a clear blue sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene is captured from a low angle against a clear, bright blue sky. In the center, a man in a dark suit and white shirt stands with his right fist raised. A red substance is visible on the right side of his face. He is surrounded by other individuals in similar attire, including a woman leaning toward him and a man in sunglasses to his left. In the background, an American flag on a dark pole waves against the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
