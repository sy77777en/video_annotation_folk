    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of the subjects, capturing their entire figures within the frame. Initially, the Spider-Man-costumed individual is positioned in the center-left of the frame, crouching low to the ground in the foreground. As the video progresses, this person stands up, moving towards the center of the frame while remaining in the foreground. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subject, ensuring the full figure is visible throughout the transition. In the background, another person dressed in a Spider-Man Noir costume is located towards the right side of the frame, walking away from the gazebo. This individual stays in the background, providing depth to the scene. The gazebo's structure occupies the middle ground, with its ornate metalwork and wooden ceiling framing the subjects. The surrounding urban landscape, including buildings and leafless trees, forms the backdrop, situated further back in the scene. The camera angle remains consistent, focusing on the Spider-Man-costumed individual's movement from a crouched to a standing position, while the other elements maintain their positions within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person dressed in a Spider-Man costume, characterized by its iconic red and blue colors with web patterns. This individual is positioned inside a gazebo-like structure, initially crouching low to the ground. As the video progresses, the person stands up, revealing more of the costume's details, including the mask covering the head and black sneakers. Another person, dressed in a Spider-Man Noir costume, is visible in the background, walking. The Spider-Man-costumed individual remains the central focus throughout the video, with their movements transitioning from a crouched to a standing position.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting in a public gazebo located in a city square. The time of day is during daylight, with overcast skies visible through the open structure. The gazebo features ornate metal railings and a wooden roof with a decorative pattern. Surrounding the gazebo, there are bare trees and multi-story buildings, indicating an urban environment. The scene includes a person in a distinctive costume, moving within the gazebo, with the cityscape providing a backdrop. The setting is calm, with no visible weather disturbances, and the architectural elements suggest a blend of traditional and urban styles.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
