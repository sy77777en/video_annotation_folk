    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot of a vast canyon at sunset. The expansive canyon, with its layered rock formations, is cast mostly in deep shadow, while a thin, winding river is visible at its bottom. Above, the sky is a dynamic canvas of dark, heavy storm clouds and lighter, puffy clouds against a backdrop of blue. Initially, the sun is hidden behind the clouds, emitting a gentle golden glow. As it gradually emerges through the gaps, this glow intensifies, casting sweeping sunbeams that illuminate the hazy atmosphere and parts of the distant landscape. In the distance, curtains of rain can be seen falling from the base of the darker clouds. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to capture the immense scale of the natural environment and the awe-inspiring atmospheric spectacle of the changing light and weather.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse captures a wide, elevated view of a vast canyon at sunset. The sky is filled with a mix of dark, heavy storm clouds and white, illuminated clouds against a blue background. As the sun dips toward the horizon on the left, its golden light breaks through the clouds, casting dramatic sunbeams that sweep across the layered rock formations of the canyon. Much of the expansive landscape is in shadow, with a winding river visible at the bottom. In the distance, rain appears to fall from the base of the dark clouds while the light and shadows continuously shift across the terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a vast canyon landscape with no main subject. The expansive canyon fills the bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground deep into the background. A small, winding river is positioned in the bottom left of the frame, deep within the canyon in the middle ground. The sky occupies the top half of the frame, with a layer of dark clouds situated horizontally across the middle ground and lighter clouds scattered in the background sky above. The sun, located off-screen to the top left, creates a glow from behind the clouds. As the video progresses, the sun's light source moves lower, casting sweeping sunbeams that originate from the top left and move across the middle ground of the canyon toward the right. The camera maintains a static, high-angle position, offering an elevated view across the entire scene.",
