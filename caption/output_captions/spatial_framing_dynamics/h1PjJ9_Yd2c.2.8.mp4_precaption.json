    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a girl washing her hands in front of a mirror. Initially, only her arms and a small part of her body are visible as she turns on the faucet. She is wearing a dark, short-sleeved shirt, and a black wristband along with a hair tie coil are noticeable on her right wrist, while her left arm does not have any accessories. Beneath the dark clothing on her left shoulder, a pink camisole-like garment is visible. As the camera tilts upward, her reflection in the mirror reveals her chest-up view, showing her with light skin and dark hair tied back. Her head is partially visible on the far right of the frame, and she appears focused on the task at hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place indoors in a modern bathroom with a minimalist design. The environment is softly lit, suggesting daytime, with natural light filtering through a window with horizontal blinds. Faintly visible through the blinds are trees and houses in a residential area. The bathroom features a sleek, white countertop with a chrome faucet and a white sink. To the right of the faucet, a cup holds colorful toothbrushes, adding a touch of color to the otherwise neutral setting, and a tube of toothpaste is located behind and to the left of the cup. The walls are light-colored, enhancing the clean and simple aesthetic. A woman is leaning over the sink and mirror, washing her hands. As the camera tilts upward, her upper body, from the chest up, becomes clearly visible in the mirror, contributing to the calm and everyday atmosphere of the scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a girl washing her hands in front of a mirror. It begins with a close-up of her turning on the faucet, showing only her arms and a small part of her body. The camera then tilts upward, revealing the chest-up body of the girl in the mirror and part of her head on the far right of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot, where the girl's right arm is in the center-left foreground, turning on a chrome faucet positioned in the center foreground. Her left arm is in the center-right foreground, under the running water in the white sink at the bottom foreground. A toothbrush holder is visible in the right middle ground, with a tube of toothpaste behind and to its left, also in the middle ground. The mirror in the background reflects the scene. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning the view. In the final framing, the girl's reflection, a chest-up shot, occupies the center-left middle ground of the mirror. The actual side of her head is visible in the far right foreground. The faucet and sink remain in the bottom foreground, though less prominent. Through the mirror, a window with horizontal blinds is visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
