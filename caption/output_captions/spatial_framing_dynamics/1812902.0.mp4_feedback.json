    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a seascape featuring a large, fortress-like structure on a rocky outcrop. The fortress occupies the central area of the frame, extending from the middle ground into the foreground, with its detailed architecture and earthy tones prominently displayed. Positioned slightly off-center towards the right, the fortress dominates the scene. The ocean surrounds the structure, filling the background and extending to the edges of the frame. In the top left corner, two boats are visible; one moves across the water, leaving a trail, while the other remains stationary. The camera maintains a consistent aerial perspective throughout, positioned above the fortress and the surrounding sea. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning of elements within the video, maintaining a steady and expansive view of the scene. The camera's height relative to the subject suggests it is significantly elevated, providing a comprehensive overview of the fortress and its interaction with the vast ocean.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a seascape scenery shot. It captures an expansive view of the ocean surrounding a large, fortress-like structure perched on a rocky outcrop. The focus is on the vastness of the sea and the imposing architecture, emphasizing the interaction between the natural and built environments. The water's deep blue contrasts with the structure's earthy tones, highlighting the scale and atmosphere rather than a specific object. The scene conveys a sense of isolation and grandeur, with the ocean's expanse and the fortress's detailed design as key visual elements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases an aerial view of a large, fortress-like structure situated on a rocky island surrounded by deep blue ocean waters. The setting is outdoors, with the time of day likely being midday, as indicated by the bright lighting and clear visibility. The structure features a combination of beige stone walls and red-tiled roofs, with a distinct geometric shape that follows the contours of the island. The ocean waves gently lap against the rocky base, creating a dynamic contrast between the solid architecture and the fluid water. Two boats are visible in the ocean; one is moving while the other remains stationary. On the island, there are some trees, vehicles, and a blue sports field, adding more detail to the scene. The overall composition highlights the isolation and prominence of the fortress within the vast expanse of the sea, under calm weather conditions.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
