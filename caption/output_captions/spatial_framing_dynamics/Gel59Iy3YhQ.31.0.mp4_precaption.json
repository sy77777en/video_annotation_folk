    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, stylized character stands on a stone platform, completely enveloped in a dark reddish-brown, hooded cloak from which two pointed ears or horns protrude. This character holds an object that emits a vibrant purple glow. A large, spectral creature materializes from beneath the water surrounding the platform, appearing as a translucent form outlined in a bright, neon-green glow. The creature has a stylized, squid-like appearance with long, curving tentacles and sheds small, light green water droplets as it fully materializes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video, a scene unfolds at night on a square stone platform surrounded by dark green water. The platform is enclosed by low stone walls and features four large, dark, stylized statues, with two at the corners and the other two near the center of the opposite side, one of which is broken and only has the lower part remaining. Lily pads float on the water's surface. A glowing green crescent moon symbol is etched onto one of the stone tiles. During the scene, a large, translucent, glowing green outline of a squid-like creature with long tentacles first touches the stone platform with two of its tentacles and then lifts itself up, its body emerging from under the water and materializing above the platform where a cloaked character stands.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot captured from a high angle, a small, cloaked character stands in the center of the frame on a square stone platform that occupies the middle ground. The platform is framed by four large statues, with two in the foreground at the bottom left and right corners and two in the background at the top left and right. Initially, small, glowing green arcs appear on the platform's edges in the middle ground. A large, spectral green creature then begins to emerge from the water in the background, behind the central character. Its glowing form rises upwards and expands, moving from the background into the middle ground until it towers directly over the character, dominating the central and upper portions of the frame.",
