    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white, shiny leather oxford-style dress shoe with black laces is shown on a red surface. A black, textured leather belt with a gold-colored buckle is draped over the top of the shoe. A small, bright green tree frog with a cream-colored underside and reddish-orange eyes appears from the left, climbs onto the belt, walks across it to the right, and then jumps off onto the surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor scene set on a red, textured carpet, a single white patent leather dress shoe with black laces rests on the floor, with a black leather belt and its gold buckle draped over the toe. Bright, warm light streams in from the background, which is out of focus. A small, green tree frog appears, climbs over the belt and shoe, and then hops down onto the carpet before moving away.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of a white leather shoe with a belt draped over it. A frog then appears from the bottom left, crawling on the belt. The camera tracks the frog as it moves left, and finally, the frog jumps to the ground.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle full shot of a white shoe positioned in the center-left of the frame, resting on a red surface that occupies the foreground and middle ground. A black belt is draped over the shoe in the middle ground. A small green frog enters from the bottom left, climbs onto the belt, and walks from left to right across the top of the shoe. The camera pans slightly to the right, tracking the frog's movement. The frog then jumps down onto the surface in the right middle ground and continues moving to the right, away from the shoe. The background remains out of focus with bright light throughout the shot.",
