    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the natural environment, emphasizing the lush greenery and dense forest. The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the overall atmosphere and scale of the forest, highlighting the beauty and tranquility of the natural setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a lush, dense forest setting during daylight. Tall trees with thick trunks and vibrant green foliage dominate the scene, creating a canopy that filters sunlight onto the forest floor. The ground is covered with a mix of moss, rocks, and fallen branches, adding texture and depth to the environment. The natural landscape is rich with varying shades of green, from the dark hues of the tree trunks to the lighter tones of the leaves. The scene conveys a sense of tranquility and natural beauty, with no visible human presence or structures, emphasizing the untouched wilderness.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a dense forest, capturing an expansive view of the natural environment. The camera remains at a consistent height, likely at eye level relative to the forest floor. Throughout the video, tall trees with thick trunks occupy the foreground and middle ground, extending vertically across the frame. These trees are positioned predominantly in the center and towards the edges, creating a sense of depth. The forest floor, visible in the lower part of the frame, features a mix of moss-covered rocks and scattered branches, primarily in the foreground and middle ground. Sunlight filters through the canopy, casting dynamic patterns of light and shadow across the scene. As the video progresses, there is a subtle shift in perspective, suggesting a slight pan or movement of the camera, which reveals more of the forest's interior. This transition maintains the focus on the lush greenery and the intricate details of the forest floor, enhancing the viewer's immersion in the tranquil and untouched wilderness. The absence of any significant changes in shot size ensures a continuous and immersive experience of the natural setting.",
