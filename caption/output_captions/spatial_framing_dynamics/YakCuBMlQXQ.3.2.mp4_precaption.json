    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with long, straight, platinum blonde hair and light skin, wearing a dark-colored jacket. Initially, the camera captures her from behind, where she is slightly out of focus. As the angle shifts to a side profile, the focus sharpens, revealing her facial features with her head slightly lowered. Her neutral expression is visible in these moments, and she remains the central focus throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors in a dense forest with tall, slender trees and a ground covered in grass and scattered fallen branches. The lighting suggests daytime, though the scene is shaded by the tree canopy, creating a subdued, cool-toned atmosphere. The environment features a mix of green and brown hues, with tree trunks displaying rough, dark bark. The forest floor is uneven, with visible roots and logs. There are no overlays, text, or digital elements present in the video. Motion is present as a figure with long, light-colored hair moves through the forest, their dark clothing contrasting with the natural surroundings. The camera maintains a steady, observational perspective, capturing the subject as they navigate the wooded terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot showing the woman from behind, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the middle ground, with the forest environment extending into the background on both sides. The camera is at her height, capturing her upper body and head as she moves forward through the wooded area. The trees and forest floor are visible in the background, filling the left, right, and upper portions of the frame, while the ground and fallen branches appear in the lower part. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a close-up from the side, with the woman\u2019s head and shoulders now filling most of the frame, still centered but shifted slightly to the right. Her face is in sharp focus, and her head is slightly lowered. The background trees remain visible but are more blurred and occupy the upper and left portions of the frame, while the forest floor is less prominent. Throughout, the camera maintains a steady, eye-level perspective, and the woman remains the central subject as she moves through the scene.",
