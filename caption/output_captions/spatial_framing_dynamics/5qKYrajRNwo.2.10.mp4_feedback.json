    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a young girl interacting with a large box. The girl occupies the center-right portion of the frame, positioned in the foreground. She leans forward towards the box, which is located slightly to her left in the middle ground. The box is a prominent object in the scene, situated near the center-left of the frame. The girl's actions involve opening the box; initially, her hands are on the latch, and then she lifts the lid, revealing the contents inside. The background features a wall with circular openings, casting light patterns across the scene. Various items, such as fabrics and other objects, are scattered around the room, filling the lower left and right areas of the frame. The camera remains at the girl's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young girl with light skin and long, dark braided hair. She is wearing a dark blue dress with short sleeves. The girl is interacting with a large, dark-colored box, which she is opening and peering into. Her posture is leaning forward, as she opens the latch and lifts the top part of the box, indicating curiosity or intent focus. The box appears to be made of a sturdy material. The setting suggests an intimate, possibly personal space, as indicated by the girl's close engagement with the box.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, dimly lit atmosphere. The environment features a wooden surface cluttered with various items, including a dark, rectangular box with a latch. The walls have a textured appearance, possibly made of wood or a similar material, with a pattern of circular openings allowing light to filter through, creating a dappled effect. The lighting casts soft shadows, enhancing the cozy ambiance. The scene includes a figure interacting with the box, adding a sense of curiosity and engagement. The overall color palette is earthy, with deep browns, greens, and hints of vibrant colors from surrounding fabrics.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
