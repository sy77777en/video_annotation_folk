    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot depicting a sterile, minimalist, and expansive interior reminiscent of a liminal space. The focus is on the environment and its unsettling atmosphere rather than a specific subject. The camera glides through a space defined by a stark contrast of textures: the lower half of the walls features a dark, mottled, concrete-like surface, while the upper walls and ceiling are covered in small, glossy white tiles. The floor is a geometric pattern of white and black tiles. The scene is illuminated by a light source that casts a sterile, slightly greenish glow, creating a dreamlike and eerie ambiance, which is further emphasized by a dark, arched doorway leading into an unknown space in the distance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moves through a stark, minimalist indoor space. The room features walls with a lower section of dark, textured material and an upper section of small white tiles that extend across the ceiling. The floor is also covered in white tiles, with a path and a larger section of black tiles leading forward. In the distance, a narrow, arched doorway opens into a dark, unlit area. The scene is bathed in a sterile, slightly greenish glow that permeates the environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot captured from a first-person perspective. The video begins with a wide shot of a minimalist interior. A dark, textured wall occupies the left side of the frame, while another is visible in the middle ground on the right. The upper walls and ceiling, featuring white tiles and two lights at the top, frame the scene. The floor at the bottom is composed of white and black tiles, with a black path leading from the foreground toward an arched doorway in the center background. The camera then glides forward, moving through the space and following the black tiled path. As it advances, the walls on the left and right expand to fill the periphery of the frame, and the arched doorway in the background grows larger, becoming the central focus.",
