    "pre_caption": "This close-up, overhead shot initially frames a child's hand extending from the top edge towards the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground. The hand holds a small blue ball, also in the center foreground, directly above a large, round container that occupies most of the frame and sits in the middle ground. This container is filled with light-colored granular pieces, visible in the middle ground and background within the container. The hand then releases the blue ball, which drops from its central position, sinking downwards through the granular pieces towards the bottom of the container while remaining in the center of the frame. The hand remains relatively stationary in the center-top foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a small, light-skinned child's hand positioned directly above the center of a round container. The child is holding a small blue ball, which is being naturally dropped into the water within the container, where it sinks to the bottom. The container has a metallic-looking rim and appears to be transparent or translucent, revealing its contents: a multitude of small, irregularly shaped, light-colored granular pieces, possibly cereal or pet food, in mixed shades of yellow and white.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot shows a small, pale hand reaching towards the center of a large, round, transparent glass container. The container is filled with a multitude of small, granular, multi-colored particles, predominantly light-colored with some yellow and darker specks. The scene appears to be set indoors with even, diffused lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
