    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a natural landscape scenery shot of a dark forest at night. The foreground is dimly illuminated, showing the trunks of several bare trees rising from a ground blanketed in dead leaves. Beyond this small patch of light, the woods recede into impenetrable blackness. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish a quiet, eerie atmosphere, focusing on the environment itself rather than a specific object or character.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark forest at night. In the foreground, several thin, bare tree trunks with gray bark are faintly illuminated. The ground, covered in a thick layer of dry, brown leaves, slopes gently upward and recedes into pitch-black darkness that obscures the deeper parts of the woods.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static wide shot of a forest scene at night, captured from a low camera angle. In the foreground, several bare tree trunks are positioned on the left and right sides of the frame. The ground, covered in leaves, occupies the bottom of the frame and slopes upward from the foreground into the middle ground. The center and upper portions of the frame are completely dark, forming the background of the scene. There are no changes in shot size, position, or camera movement throughout the clip.",
