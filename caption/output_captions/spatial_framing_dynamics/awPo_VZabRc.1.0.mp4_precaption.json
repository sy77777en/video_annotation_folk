    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of this animated video is a young man with pale skin and black, spiky hair. He wears a black jacket over a white t-shirt and is seen navigating through a crowded train car. Surrounding him are other passengers depicted in a similar stylized, angular art style. The passengers are either seated or standing, holding onto poles, leaning against railings, or facing the train doors, creating a packed environment through which the main character moves.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place inside a crowded, moving subway car, rendered in a stylized, angular animation. The interior is characterized by beige bench-style seating, vertical metal poles for standing passengers, and a dark, ribbed floor. Through the windows, a dark, blurred landscape suggests the train is in motion. The color palette is predominantly muted, with desaturated tones of gray, blue, and brown. The car is filled with various passengers, some seated and others standing, as the perspective shifts through the narrow aisle.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of the main subject positioned in the center middle ground, walking down the train aisle toward the camera. A passenger is in the right foreground with their back to the viewer, while other passengers are seated in the left middle ground and standing in the background. The shot then transitions into a close-up, reframing the main subject in the center foreground from the chest up as he holds onto a pole. In this final composition, surrounding passengers are relegated to the background and the bottom left and right corners of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
