    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of this animated video is a semi-transparent, glowing white toilet that assembles itself in the center of a dark, reflective space. Initially, its components\u2014the bowl, tank, and open lid\u2014are shown floating apart before coming together to form a complete unit. To the left and slightly closer to the camera, another toilet with a similar ghostly, semi-transparent white appearance is fully revealed at the beginning but then disappears from the left side of the frame. Before the central toilet becomes fully assembled, the white text \"Washdown toilet\" appears in the lower-left corner, along with a consistent display of the text \"[1,2,3,4]\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, minimalist setting with a reflective black floor, two semi-transparent, glowing white toilets are visible. The toilet in the center is initially shown in an exploded view, with its lid and tank cover floating above the bowl. These components then lower into place to form a complete toilet. To the left, another toilet of similar appearance is initially visible but disappears from view as the camera moves forward. The scene is rendered in a monochromatic style. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"Washdown toilet\" in white, and another overlay displays the text \"[1,2,3,4]\" in white.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot begins with two toilets positioned on a reflective surface. A partially visible toilet is in the foreground on the left, while another toilet is in the center middle ground with its components floating separately. As the shot progresses, the components of the central toilet lower and assemble into a complete unit. Simultaneously, the toilet in the foreground left moves out of the frame. The text \"Washdown toilet\" appears and remains in the bottom-left corner. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
