    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up of the front exterior of a large, two-story house built with red bricks, featuring multiple windows with white frames, a dark roof, and an arched wooden front door beneath a black light fixture. As the camera zooms out, it reveals a black metal fence with decorative finials enclosing a green lawn, and a substantial bush with red flowers near the house's entrance. The zoom-out action also includes the right-side fence pillar, a white stucco structure holding a black light fixture, which forms part of a black metal gate. Additionally, the adjacent white house with a red tile roof becomes visible on the far right, along with a small blue security sign staked in the lawn close to the fence.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows the exterior of a large, two-story red brick house with white-framed windows and a dark shingled roof, set behind a black wrought iron fence with spear-point finials. An arched wooden front door is a central feature of the house. In the foreground, the black wrought iron fence, along with a white stucco pillar featuring a modern black light fixture and a black wrought iron gate that opens onto a paved area, forms part of the property's boundary. In the midground, a well-maintained green lawn and various bushes, including one with red flowers near the entrance, are visible. The scene, captured during the daytime under an overcast sky, also reveals a neighboring house with a light-colored stucco exterior and a red tile roof to the right as the view widens slightly.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a zoom-in on the front door of a house, with a fence visible in the foreground. As the camera zooms out, it transitions to a wide shot, revealing the entire yard and the house.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot focusing on the central portion of a red brick house in the middle ground, its arched wooden front door centrally located within this view. A black metal fence spans the foreground across the bottom of the frame. To the left of the door in the middle ground is a large bush with red flowers, and a small blue security sign is staked in the green lawn at the bottom left, near the foreground fence. A white stucco pillar with a black light fixture is partially visible in the right foreground. As the camera zooms out, the shot transitions to a wide shot. In this wider view, the entire red brick house is now seen in the middle ground, positioned more towards the left of center. The black metal fence remains in the foreground, extending further across the frame. The white stucco pillar in the right foreground is now fully visible, with an attached black metal gate also in the right foreground. The green lawn occupies the area between the foreground fence and the middle ground house, and an adjacent white house with a red tile roof becomes visible in the background on the far right.",
