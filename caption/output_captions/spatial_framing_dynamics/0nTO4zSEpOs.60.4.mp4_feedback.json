    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a bustling urban scene at night, capturing a spacious, tiled pedestrian walkway in the foreground and middle ground. Several people are dispersed across the walkway, moving in various directions, with some carrying bags and wearing face masks. The individuals are primarily positioned in the center and right of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground. Tall, illuminated buildings with prominent signage, including one displaying the \"GMO\" logo, dominate the background, positioned centrally and to the left. The camera is at the height of the subjects, providing a clear view of the cityscape. The scene transitions slightly as the camera pans right, maintaining the wide shot while shifting the focus to include more of the illuminated skyscrapers and digital billboards in the background. The overall composition highlights the vibrant city atmosphere, with the glass railings and city lights reflecting off surfaces, enhancing the dynamic urban environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a bustling urban scene at night, with several people walking on a tiled pedestrian walkway. Some individuals are carrying bags, and a few are wearing face masks. The setting is surrounded by tall, illuminated buildings with prominent signage, contributing to a vibrant city atmosphere. The people are dispersed across the walkway, moving in various directions, suggesting a typical evening in a busy city area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor urban setting at night, featuring a bustling cityscape with modern architecture. The scene is set in a well-lit area with tall buildings, including one prominently displaying the \"GMO\" logo. The environment is characterized by a spacious, tiled pedestrian walkway with glass railings, where several people are walking. The city lights illuminate the area, reflecting off the glass and metal surfaces, creating a vibrant atmosphere. The weather is clear, allowing for an unobstructed view of the illuminated skyscrapers and digital billboards. Overlay elements include text in the bottom left corner, indicating \"Virtual Japan TV,\" which is not part of the physical scene.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
