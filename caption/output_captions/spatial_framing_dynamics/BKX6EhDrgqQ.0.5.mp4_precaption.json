    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white, vertically oriented self-service ordering kiosk is shown. It features a large, rectangular touchscreen with a black border, displaying the McDonald's ordering interface on a white background. The screen is titled \"Discover our menu\" and presents several food categories with corresponding images, including \"Highlights,\" \"McCrispy,\" \"McMenu,\" \"Double Hamburger Royale,\" \"Happy Meal,\" and \"Desserts.\" The images show various food items like burgers, fries, and drinks. A navigation menu with icons runs down the left side of the screen, and the McDonald's golden arches logo is in the top-left corner. At the bottom of the screen, the order total is displayed as \"0,00\u20ac\" next to an \"Add to your order\" button. Below the screen, on the kiosk's white body, there is a small black keypad and a horizontal slot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A white, rectangular self-service ordering kiosk is shown indoors against a background of gray and white tiled flooring. The kiosk features a large, vertical touchscreen displaying the McDonald's ordering interface, which is titled \"Discover our menu.\" The screen presents various food categories such as \"Highlights,\" \"McMenu,\" \"Happy Meal,\" and \"Desserts,\" each accompanied by an image of the food. A navigation menu runs down the left side of the screen, while the order total at the bottom shows \"0,00\u20ac.\" A payment terminal is integrated into the kiosk's body below the screen. In the bottom-left corner, a semi-transparent watermark overlay reads \"McDonald's Germany.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "A white, self-service ordering kiosk is captured in a static full shot, positioned in the center of the frame. The camera is positioned above the kiosk, providing a high-angle view that shows the top of the machine and the surrounding gray and white tiled floor, which extends from the foreground into the background. The kiosk itself occupies the middle ground of the scene.",
