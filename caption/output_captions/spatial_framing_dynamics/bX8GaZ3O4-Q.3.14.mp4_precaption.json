    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially focuses on a dark, cylindrical water sprayer in the foreground, which is actively spraying water upwards in a fine, fan-shaped mist. The focus then shifts to the middle ground, revealing a brownish-green frog with a light-colored throat pouch sitting on a dark rock. A second, more vibrant green frog with a bluish tint appears on an adjacent rock. Finally, a third, smaller green frog jumps into the scene from the lower left, landing near the other two but not on a rock. The frogs are positioned facing the sprinkler.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, from a level-angle perspective, a dark, cylindrical pop-up sprinkler head sprays a fine mist of water upwards. The scene is set on dark, damp ground with several rocks and blurred green foliage in the background. The water spray is illuminated, creating a bright contrast with the dark surroundings. During the sequence, three brownish-green frogs enter the scene, with two positioning themselves on the rocks near the sprinkler.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot, focusing on a small water sprayer in the foreground, fully in frame. The focus then shifts (rack focus) to three frogs in the middleground, which jump into the frame one by one.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a water sprayer positioned in the right foreground, with blurred rocks and foliage occupying the middle ground and background. The focus then racks from the sprayer to the middle ground, where a frog hops onto a rock in the center-left of the frame. A second frog then enters, settling on another rock just to the right of the first. Finally, a third frog jumps into the shot from the bottom left, landing on the ground in the middle ground, slightly in front of the other two frogs. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the sequence.",
