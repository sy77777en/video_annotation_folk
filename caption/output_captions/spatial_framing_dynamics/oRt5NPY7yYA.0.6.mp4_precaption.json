    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A long convoy of vehicles travels along a road through an arid, desert-like landscape. The main subject is a large semi-trailer truck positioned in the center of the convoy, featuring a dark-colored cab and a long, rectangular, unmarked white trailer. This truck is escorted by several other vehicles. In front of the white truck are three dark, boxy, armored military-style trucks. Leading the entire procession is a black and white police SUV. Following behind the central white truck are two more dark, armored military-style trucks, identical to those at the front. A second black and white police SUV brings up the rear, completing the single-file formation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a convoy of vehicles moving along a paved road that cuts through a vast, arid landscape. The scene takes place during the day under a bright, slightly overcast sky. The terrain consists of sandy, light-brown ground and rolling hills dotted with sparse, low-lying green bushes. In the distance, larger, pale hills form the horizon, with the faint silhouette of a city skyline visible. The convoy prominently features a large white semi-truck with a dark-colored cab and a long, unmarked rectangular white trailer, escorted by several dark, armored military-style vehicles and a police SUV at both the front and rear.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a convoy of vehicles is positioned horizontally across the center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. The main subject, a white semi-truck, is located at the center of this formation, escorted by armored vehicles and police SUVs. The camera tracks parallel to the convoy, moving from right to left, which keeps the vehicles relatively static in the center of the frame. This camera movement causes the sandy terrain and sparse bushes in the foreground to blur past, while the rolling hills and a faint city skyline in the background scroll by. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
