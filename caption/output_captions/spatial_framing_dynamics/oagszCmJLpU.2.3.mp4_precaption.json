    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a landscape scenery shot capturing a dramatic time-lapse of a powerful thunderstorm over a vast, flat plain as dusk transitions into night. The focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the weather event rather than a specific subject. A massive, dark, and turbulent storm cloud dominates the deep blue sky, its interior illuminated by frequent, brilliant flashes of white and purple lightning. As the sequence progresses and the sky darkens, faint stars begin to appear in the clearer sections, while the last vestiges of sunset cast a soft pink glow on smaller, peripheral clouds. Along the distant, dark horizon, a scattering of tiny, bright lights suggests a far-off town or sparse settlement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse captures a massive storm system developing at the time of sunset over a flat, dark landscape. The sky gradually becomes a deep, dark blue, with stars visible in the clearer sections. A large, churning mass of dark blue and black clouds dominates the view, with intermittent flashes of lightning illuminating its interior, revealing white and purple hues. The storm clouds move rightward and away from the camera, although the lightning does not have a prominent direction. Along the distant, flat horizon, a few small, bright lights are scattered.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape, captured from a static, low-angle camera position on the ground. A massive storm cloud formation dominates the top-left and center of the frame, situated in the middle ground and extending into the background. Below this, a thin, dark strip of land occupies the bottom of the frame. Throughout the time-lapse, the main cloud mass moves from left to right and appears to recede, while flashes of lightning illuminate its interior. The sky, visible in the top and right portions of the frame, transitions from deep blue to black, with stars becoming visible in the top-right background. A few small, stationary lights are scattered along the distant horizon in the background at the bottom of the scene.",
