The camera then tilts downwards, revealing a man in a wide shot. The man is situated in the bottom left foreground, standing on the edge of a rocky cliff. Sparse bushes are visible in the bottom left and bottom right foreground.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a wide view of a large, rugged mountain with steep, rocky surfaces and sparse vegetation at the top. As the scene progresses, the focus shifts to a man standing sideways to the camera on the edge of a rocky cliff. He is wearing a light gray sweater and a black beanie, with short hair visible beneath the hat. The man appears to be assessing the height of the mountain and the rocky cliff, looking up and down, possibly preparing to continue his climb. The transition from the mountain to the man on the cliff creates a sense of scale and perspective, highlighting the vastness of the landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video opens on a hazy, overcast day, showcasing a massive, grey granite rock formation dominating the background. Below, a dense, dark green evergreen forest covers the lower slopes and stretches into a valley. The camera then tilts downwards, revealing a rocky outcrop in the foreground. Sparse, dry bushes and a few gnarled trees cling to this outcrop. A person wearing a light-colored shirt and a dark beanie is seen on the edge of this rocky precipice, looking toward the rear side of the cliff, scanning up and down as if evaluating the height of the rocky mountain, possibly in preparation for further climbing.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a wide shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
