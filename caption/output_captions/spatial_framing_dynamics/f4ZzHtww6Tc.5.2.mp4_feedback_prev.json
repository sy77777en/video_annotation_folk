    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing the man in a white T-shirt and dark pants positioned to the left of the frame, near a picnic table and skateboard, with the fenced skate park in the background. The man is in the middle ground, while the fence and trees are in the background. The camera is at the subject's height, providing a level view. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a full shot, focusing more closely on the man as he moves around the table. In this closer framing, the man occupies the center of the frame, with the table and skateboard still visible, but the background elements like the fence and trees become less prominent. The camera maintains its height relative to the subject throughout, emphasizing the man's actions and interactions with the table.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a light skin tone, wearing a white T-shirt, dark pants, and sneakers. He has short hair and is seen near a skateboard in a park setting. The man is positioned around a picnic table, and his actions suggest he is preparing to flip the table rather than engage with the skateboard.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in an outdoor skate park during the day, featuring a fenced area with metal bars and benches. The ground is paved, and there are trees providing some shade. A skateboard is visible on the ground near a picnic table, suggesting activity related to skating. The environment is monochromatic, giving it a classic, timeless feel. The setting is calm, with no visible movement, and the focus is on the structural elements like the fence and benches, which are made of metal and wood. The overall atmosphere is quiet and still, with a clear view of the park's layout and features.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
