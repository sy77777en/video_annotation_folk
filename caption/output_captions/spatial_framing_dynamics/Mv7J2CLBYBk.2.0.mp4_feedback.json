    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a man in the center-foreground on a wet airport tarmac marked with red lines. A large airplane occupies the middle ground, extending from the left to the right side of the frame, with its wing stretching across the top. A set of mobile stairs is positioned in the left-foreground, leading up to the plane. In the center-background, another airplane is visible. The man runs from the center towards the stairs on the left. As he jumps onto and runs up the stairs, the camera follows his movement, causing the framing to tighten from a full shot to a medium shot. This action repositions the man from the center-foreground to the left side of the frame, moving from the bottom towards the top as he ascends. The camera remains at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man dressed in black athletic clothing is shown performing parkour before running up a set of metal stairs attached to an airplane. He is wearing a black long-sleeved jacket with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows, featuring two white stripes on both sleeves, a black undershirt, black pants, and black and white sneakers. A black long-sleeved garment is tied around his waist, and he wears a blue-grey baseball cap. In an agile motion, he uses his hands to grip the railings and pull himself onto the stairs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on an outdoor airport tarmac under an overcast sky. A large, white passenger airplane with a blue logo on its tail is parked on the wet, paved ground, which features prominent red painted lines. A metal mobile staircase is positioned against the aircraft, leading up to an entrance. A red and white warning sign with German text is attached to the railing of the stairs. In the middle ground, another airplane is visible on the tarmac, positioned in front of a small grassy hill in the background. A person in dark clothing and a cap moves swiftly around and then ascends the staircase toward the plane.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
