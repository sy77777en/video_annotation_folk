    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially shows several people on an opposite balcony in the background, some wearing white hard hats and light-colored shirts, in what appears to be an industrial or construction setting. In the foreground, initially out of focus, are the upper bodies of a man and a woman viewed from behind. The man has dark hair and wears a white collared shirt with a dark strap or lanyard visible around his neck. The woman has red hair and is dressed in a gray-blue, collared, button-up shirt. The focus then shifts to the woman as she turns towards the man, revealing her fair skin and a smile. She then leans in and kisses the man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The camera captures a medium shot from behind a man and a woman in a large, multi-level indoor space with concrete walls and exposed structural elements, including yellow beams. Metal railings line walkways overlooking an open multi-story area. In the background, several people, some wearing hard hats, are present on different levels near a large cylindrical structure. The woman turns to speak to the man, and they share a kiss as loose papers fall around them.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is shot from a third-person over-the-shoulder POV on a balcony, showing a man and woman, and people on the opposite balcony. It starts by focusing on the people across, with the foreground blurry, showing half of the upper body of a man in white and a woman in gray blue from behind. The woman then turns, and the focus shifts to her as she kisses the man.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium over-the-shoulder shot, initially focusing on several people in the background, positioned centrally and to the right on an opposite balcony within a multi-level indoor space; a large cylindrical structure is also visible in the background center. In the blurry foreground, the upper half of a man is on the left, and a woman is to his right, both seen from behind. Yellow beams and metal railings are visible in the middle ground and background. The camera is initially positioned slightly above the foreground subjects. As the woman in the foreground center-right turns towards the man on the foreground left, the focus shifts sharply to her, transitioning to a medium close-up. Her movement brings her face into clear view, and the camera adjusts to be more at their eye level. Loose papers begin to fall in the foreground and middle ground, primarily to the right and towards the bottom of the frame, as she leans in and kisses the man, who remains in the foreground left.",
