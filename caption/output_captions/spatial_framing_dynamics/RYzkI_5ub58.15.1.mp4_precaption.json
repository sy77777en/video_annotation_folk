    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video beautifully captures a vibrant underwater scene near a coral reef, showcasing a rich diversity of marine life. It features various fish, including those with striking black and white stripes and yellow tails, as well as darker-colored species, all swimming gracefully among the vividly colored corals. The corals exhibit a wide range of textures and hues, from orange and white branching structures to green and brown bulbous forms. The fish glide elegantly between the corals, set against the backdrop of a cobalt blue ocean, creating a dynamic and lively underwater environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an underwater scene set in a vibrant coral reef environment beneath the open sea. The crystal-clear, deep blue water glistens under the sunlight, illuminating a colorful array of marine life. The coral structures vary in shape and color\u2014some are branching forms in white, reddish-brown, or slightly earthy yellow, while others are spherical with rich textures. Small fish of various colors, including black and striped ones, swim around the corals, adding movement to the scene. The overall atmosphere is tranquil yet vivid, emphasizing the natural beauty and diversity of the underwater ecosystem.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a vibrant underwater coral reef scene. Various fish, including black and white striped ones and darker species, occupy different positions within the frame. In the foreground, two black and white striped fish are positioned towards the bottom left, moving slightly within the frame. A darker fish is located in the middle ground, closer to the center-right. The corals, displaying diverse shapes and colors, fill the entire frame, with branching structures in the left and central areas and bulbous forms on the right. The background consists of a deep blue ocean, with smaller fish scattered throughout. The camera remains at the same height as the subjects, capturing the dynamic interaction between the fish and the coral reef. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position during the sequence.",
