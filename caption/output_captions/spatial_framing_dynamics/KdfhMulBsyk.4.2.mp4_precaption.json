    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a man, seen from the front, walking down a dark, foggy street. He is a silhouette wearing a long, dark coat. In the background, further down the street, are two large, boxy vehicles with bright headlights that illuminate the dense, blue-tinted fog. A small group of silhouetted figures is clustered between the man and the vehicles. On the left side of the scene, a single bright headlight from a mostly obscured vehicle is visible near the ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A lone figure in a dark coat walks down a foggy, snow-dusted urban street at night. The scene is cast in a cool, blue-green light, primarily illuminated by the bright headlights of several large, truck-like vehicles on the right, which appear to be moving forward with a group of silhouetted figures riding on them. A series of small lights along the upper walkway of a large, dark building on the left adds to the illumination. The air is thick with mist or falling snow, obscuring details and creating a hazy atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot filmed at the subject's level, a man in a long coat is positioned in the center middle ground, walking away from the camera. In the background on the right, two large vehicles with bright headlights are visible. A group of silhouetted figures is clustered in the center-right middle ground, between the man and the vehicles. A large, dark building with a row of lights occupies the left middle ground. In the bottom-left foreground, a single headlight from an obscured vehicle is visible.",
