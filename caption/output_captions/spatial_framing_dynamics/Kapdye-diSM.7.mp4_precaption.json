    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a street scene with several parked and moving cars. The vehicles include a white SUV, a blue sports car, a black luxury sedan, and a red car, among others. The cars are positioned along the side of a city street lined with ornate, historic buildings. The scene captures a typical urban environment with a mix of modern and classic architecture, and the cars are the primary subjects, showcasing a variety of colors and styles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, the perspective moves slowly down a city street during the day. The road is flanked by tall, ornate buildings constructed from light-colored stone, featuring numerous windows and black flags hanging from poles. The paved street is marked with white lines for parking, where several vehicles, including a black SUV, a white van, a silver convertible, and a white SUV, are parked. Green trees are interspersed along the sidewalk. The scene is presented with a red and white text overlay in the bottom right corner that reads \"the STRADMAN\".**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a first-person perspective inside a vehicle moving forward along a city street. Initially, the rear of a black SUV occupies the bottom left foreground. In the middle ground, a white van, a dark convertible, and a white SUV are parked in a line from left to center along the road. Tall, ornate buildings dominate the right side of the frame and the background. As the camera advances, the foreground SUV moves out of frame to the left, replaced by a different black SUV that keeps pace with the camera in the bottom left. The parked cars appear to slide from the center towards the right and recede, while a silver SUV enters from the right, moving towards the center as it drives down the street. Throughout the shot, the buildings scroll past on the right, and a text overlay remains fixed in the bottom right corner.",
