    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, a figure stands in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground within a wooded clearing. The scene is framed by out-of-focus foliage in the foreground, which occupies the left and bottom portions of the screen. The figure remains motionless, surrounded by dense trees and undergrowth that fill the middle ground and background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A tall, slender figure stands in a wooded clearing, dressed in a dark suit jacket over a white shirt. The figure's head is completely covered by a smooth, pale, featureless mask, giving it the appearance of a mannequin. The figure remains stationary, positioned in the midground between dense foliage.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Viewed from a fixed position through foreground foliage, the scene is set within a small clearing in a dense, overgrown forest. The environment is rendered in a desaturated, almost monochromatic palette of muted greens and greys, suggesting an overcast day. The clearing has a pale ground covered in gravel or dry leaves and is surrounded by tangled trees with gnarled branches and thick undergrowth. In the distance, a figure wearing a dark jacket and a white shirt stands among the trees.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
