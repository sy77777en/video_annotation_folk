    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and movement** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial composition and motion** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on how much of the subject is visible. For example, *a close-up shot of a human face*, *a medium shot of a man\u2019s lower body*, or *a wide shot of a man standing near the ocean*. If the shot size does not follow a typical framing pattern or changes erratically, describe the overall framing instead, such as *\"The camera tracks a skateboarder in an unsteady manner, mostly capturing the skateboarder\u2019s lower body.\"*  \n\nNext, describe the **subject\u2019s position in the scene**. Indicate their approximate location within the frame, such as *\"The person is in the bottom-left corner of the frame\"* or *\"The person is on the right of the frame.\"* Describe their depth in the scene relative to the **foreground, midground, or background**, such as *\"In the foreground, a person is sitting in front of a computer.\"* Additionally, specify their physical placement within the environment, such as *\"The woman in the midground stands near a window, looking outside.\"*  \n\nFinally, describe the **subject\u2019s height relative to the camera**, if relevant. Indicate whether they are framed at eye level, above, or below the camera\u2019s perspective, such as *\"The man is framed at eye level.\"* or *\"A low-angle shot captures the person from below.\"*\n\nFor **scenery-focused shots without a primary subject**, describe how the scene is framed by detailing its **shot size** and **spatial composition**.  \n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** used to capture the environment, such as *a wide shot of a vast mountain range stretching across the horizon* or *a close-up of raindrops hitting a window*.  \n\nNext, describe the **spatial composition**, including the positioning of key elements within the frame. Indicate where objects appear, such as *a symmetrical shot of a hallway positioned at the center, leading toward a vanishing point* or *a large tree stands in the left-bottom corner*. Incorporate depth by mentioning **foreground, midground, and background** elements when relevant. For instance, *in the foreground, a bicycle is parked against a fence, while in the background, skyscrapers rise against the sky* or *the midground features a river cutting through the landscape*.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes within the frame, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.  \n\nFor **subjects**, indicate how their position and framing evolve. For example, *\"A medium shot of a man\u2019s upper body near a doorway transitions into a close-up of his face as he walks toward the camera.\"* Similarly, describe movement across the frame, such as *\"A cyclist moves from the left to the right side of the frame, maintaining a full shot throughout.\"* If the camera\u2019s perspective changes, specify the shift, like *\"A full-body shot of a child at eye level shifts as the camera tilts upward, reframing them from a low angle looking up.\"*  \n\nFor **scenery shots**, describe how the framing adjusts to reveal different aspects of the environment. For instance, *\"The shot begins with an aerial view of a city skyline, then tilts downward to focus on a busy intersection.\"* If the camera moves through space, specify the transition, such as *\"The camera moves forward, transitioning from a wide view of a dense forest to a close-up of a single tree trunk covered in moss.\"*\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not comprehensively capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference or starting point to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video, but do not rely on them completely. Focus on the subject's **shot size, position, and movement** within the frame. Remember, your goal is to describe the **spatial composition and motion** within the shot.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially focuses on a wine cabinet in the background, filled with various bottles arranged on shelves. As the focus shifts to the foreground, it reveals half of a wine glass containing light blue wine on the left side. Next to the glass, there are several pieces of white-grey colored cheese placed in the middle. The scene transitions from the detailed view of the wine cabinet to highlighting the wine glass and cheese, emphasizing the change in focus from background to foreground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a focus on a modern, stylish wine cellar. The environment features a tall, illuminated wine rack filled with bottles, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. In the foreground, a sleek countertop holds a glass container with a light blue liquid and a small plate with white snacks, adding a touch of elegance to the scene. The lighting is soft and ambient, suggesting a calm and sophisticated ambiance, likely during the evening. The overall composition highlights the refined and contemporary design of the space.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with the wine cabinet in focus in the background. A rack focus then shifts the attention to the foreground, revealing half of a wine glass with light blue wine on the left and a white-grey colored food item, possibly cheese, in the middle.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a wine cabinet in the background, filled with various bottles arranged on illuminated shelves. The camera employs a rack focus, transitioning the viewer's attention to the foreground. Here, a medium shot reveals half of a wine glass containing light blue wine positioned on the left side of the frame, while several pieces of white-grey cheese are centrally placed on a sleek countertop. The spatial composition shifts from emphasizing the depth and arrangement of the wine cabinet to highlighting the elegant presentation of the wine glass and cheese in the foreground. The scene is framed at eye level, maintaining a sophisticated and contemporary indoor setting.",
