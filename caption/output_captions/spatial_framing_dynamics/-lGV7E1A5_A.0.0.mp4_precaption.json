    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is shot from the first-person perspective of a motorcyclist. At the bottom of the frame, the rider's hands, covered in white and black gloves with orange details, are visible gripping the black handlebars. The front of the motorcycle, which is gray and black and features the \"Red Bull\" logo in large red and white letters, is also in view. On both sides of the blue track, a large crowd of spectators in casual attire stands behind white and orange barriers, watching the event.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, shows a perspective moving down a long, blue-surfaced track in an outdoor park setting. The event takes place during the day under a cloudy sky, with the Chicago skyline and its prominent skyscrapers visible in the background. Crowds of spectators stand behind white and orange barriers lining the grassy areas on both sides of the track. In the distance, a tall, dark-colored take-off ramp is centered at the end of the path, while a large blue quarter-pipe ramp with Red Bull branding stands to the left. Large video screens are also present. A red and white Red Bull logo is visible on the front of the motorcycle.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is shot from a first-person perspective, showing a motorcyclist riding. At the bottom of the frame, part of the rider\u2019s hands gripping the handlebars is visible, surrounded by a crowd of spectators and a distant cityscape. \n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is likely mounted on the rider\u2019s helmet, so its height is above the motorcyclist.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is captured from a first-person perspective, with the motorcycle's handlebars and the rider's hands occupying the bottom center of the frame in the immediate foreground. A blue track extends from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground, creating a central leading line. Spectators are positioned in the middle ground along the left and right sides of the frame, behind white and orange barriers, respectively. In the distance, a tall, dark take-off ramp is centered in the middle ground, with a large blue quarter-pipe ramp to its left. The Chicago skyline fills the background across the top of the frame. The camera, positioned at the rider's eye level, moves forward along the track, causing the ramps and crowds to increase in size. As the rider nears the end of the track, the camera pans slightly to the left, shifting the central take-off ramp toward the right side of the frame and bringing the quarter-pipe on the left into a more prominent position.",
