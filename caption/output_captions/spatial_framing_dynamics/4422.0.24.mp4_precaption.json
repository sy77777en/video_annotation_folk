    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with short, messy brown hair is energetically playing a drum set. He is wearing a light blue blazer over a white hoodie; the hoodie has the word \"HELLBOY\" printed in red letters within a red outlined box on the chest. He is shown shouting with an intense expression as he plays with drumsticks. Parts of the drum set are visible, including golden-bronze colored cymbals; one larger cymbal has \"PAISTE\" written on it in black lettering.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video unfolds on an urban rooftop beneath a grey, overcast sky. A sprawling cityscape, characterized by buildings of various heights and a distinct tower in the distance, forms the backdrop. A low, dark brick wall lines part of the rooftop, and metallic drum cymbals, one notably larger with \"PAISTE\" markings, are prominent elements within this setting.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a man playing the drums, with a part of the drum set visible. The shot size transitions from a medium close-up of the man to a medium shot and then returns to a medium close-up at the end.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a man in the center foreground, with a golden-bronze cymbal marked \"PAISTE\" to his left in the foreground. A dark brick wall is visible in the middle ground behind him, and a cityscape forms the background. The shot transitions to a medium shot, still keeping the man in the center foreground, revealing more of the drum set with cymbals on both his left and right in the foreground. The cityscape remains in the background, and the brick wall is in the middle ground. The camera then pans slightly, following the man's movements as he shifts within the center foreground. Finally, the shot returns to a medium close-up, with the man in the center foreground, sometimes slightly to the right, and the \"PAISTE\" cymbal prominent in the left foreground, while the cityscape, including a distant tower, occupies the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout.",
