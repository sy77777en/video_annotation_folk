    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a tranquil campground scenery shot, capturing a well-appointed RV site on a partly cloudy day. The scene is centered on a large, modern recreational vehicle, decorated with sweeping graphics in shades of brown, cream, and black, parked under the shade of leafy green trees. In front of the RV, a raised patio area, enclosed by a low, curved retaining wall of reddish-brown blocks, is furnished with a black grill, a small table and chairs, and a couple of Adirondack chairs, creating an inviting outdoor living space. The camera remains stationary, establishing a sense of place and atmosphere rather than focusing on a single subject. This wide, static composition allows the viewer to take in the entire environment, from the details of the campsite to the other RVs visible down the paved road, emphasizing the overall setting of the RV park.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in an RV park during the daytime under a partly cloudy sky. A large fifth-wheel RV, painted with tan, white, and black swooping graphics, is parked at a campsite. The site is elevated on a curved retaining wall constructed from brown, textured blocks. On this raised patio area, there is a black grill next to a white propane tank, a small black metal table with matching chairs, and two outdoor lounge chairs. Small green bushes are planted along the retaining wall. A paved road runs alongside the campsites, where other RVs are visible in the background. A large tree with green leaves stands in the foreground, partially framing the view of the main RV as the perspective slowly zooms out.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of an RV park. A large RV occupies the middle ground, positioned from the left to the center of the frame. In the foreground, a curved retaining wall stretches across the bottom of the frame, with a patio on top holding a grill on the left and furniture in the center. A large tree in the immediate foreground on the left partially frames the view. A paved road runs from the bottom-right into the background, where other RVs are visible on the right. The camera, positioned at eye-level, slowly zooms out, causing the framing tree on the left and the road on the right to become more prominent.",
