    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of an outdoor patio scene, captured from a high angle. The shot focuses on the scenery rather than a specific subject. Initially, a round, glass-topped table is in the center-right middle ground, with the back of a chair in the bottom-center foreground. In the background, two lounge chairs are on the right, while a sandy area with a tree occupies the top-left. The camera slowly pans to the left, shifting the table and chair toward the right edge of the frame. This movement brings the sandy area, foliage, and stepping stones from the left side to fill the center and left portions of the view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an outdoor patio scenery shot, capturing a tranquil and private relaxation space. There is no main subject because the focus is on establishing the atmosphere and environment of the location. The camera's perspective is meant to immerse the viewer in the setting, highlighting the arrangement of a dark, glass-topped table, chairs with black backs and grey cushions, and grey loungers on a concrete patio that borders a sandy area with tropical plants.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A slow pan reveals an outdoor patio during the day, featuring a grey concrete floor adjacent to an area of light-colored sand with a tree and green foliage. A round, dark wicker table with a reflective glass top sits on the concrete, holding a small, square white box. A matching dark wicker chair is positioned at the table. In the background, two grey lounge chairs rest against a plain white wall, and square stepping stones are visible on the sand. The lighting is soft and even, suggesting a shaded location.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
