    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a neighborhood scenery shot, capturing a quiet residential area with traditional and modern houses. The focus is on the environment, showcasing a blend of architectural styles with wooden and tiled structures, neatly trimmed greenery, and a clear blue sky. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the atmosphere and scale of the neighborhood, highlighting the peaceful and orderly setting rather than any specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, capturing a quiet residential street in a suburban neighborhood. The setting is outdoors on a sunny day, with clear blue skies and bright sunlight casting distinct shadows. The street is lined with traditional Japanese houses featuring sloped, tiled roofs and wooden exteriors. A small, well-maintained garden with a neatly trimmed tree is visible beside a driveway, where a black car is parked. Adjacent to the driveway, a garage is open, revealing two vehicles parked inside, along with some boxes and children's bicycles. Utility poles and wires run along the street, adding to the suburban atmosphere. The scene is calm, with no visible movement, emphasizing the peacefulness of the neighborhood.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot capturing a quiet residential street in a suburban neighborhood. The scene is framed to show the street running from the bottom left to the top right, with traditional Japanese houses on both sides. In the foreground, on the right side, a black car is parked beside a driveway, with a small, neatly trimmed tree nearby. The garage, visible in the middle ground, is open, revealing two vehicles and some items inside. Utility poles and wires run along the left side of the street, extending into the background, enhancing the suburban atmosphere. The camera is positioned at street level, providing a first-person perspective that emphasizes the peaceful and orderly setting. The scene remains static, with no visible movement, highlighting the tranquility of the neighborhood.",
