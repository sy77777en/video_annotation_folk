    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two stylized, human-like figures rendered in a gray, low-polygon style, giving them a faceted, geometric appearance. Initially, the focus is on the back of one figure seated in a chair in the foreground. As the video progresses, the focus shifts to the other figure, who is seated opposite, facing forward with their hands in their lap. This second figure comes into clear view while the foreground figure blurs and moves out of the frame. Both figures are depicted in a similar static, seated pose.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark, indoor space resembling a studio or auditorium. In the center, two stylized, low-poly figures are seated in chairs, illuminated by warm spotlights that cast long shadows across the floor. The figure in the foreground is viewed from behind, while the one in the mid-ground faces forward. The background contains rows of empty chairs. Overlaid on the bottom half of the scene is a quiz show interface with a question box that reads, \"Which American platform was founded in 2012 and is known for its creative and interactive online lessons?\". Below the question are four empty answer boxes labeled A, B, C, and D. A small text overlay in the top right corner indicates an \"AI-generated voice\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video opens with a medium shot of a figure in what appears to be a quiz show. As the camera lifts upward and moves forward, the foreground figure gradually falls out of focus and exits the frame, while the person opposite comes into focus in a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, centered on the back of a stylized figure seated in the foreground. In the middle ground, a second figure sits facing the camera, while rows of empty chairs occupy the background. A quiz show interface is overlaid in the foreground across the bottom of the screen. The camera then moves forward and slightly upward, causing the foreground figure to blur and move down, eventually exiting the frame. This movement brings the second figure into sharp focus, transitioning the scene to a full shot of them, now centered. Throughout this transition, the camera remains positioned above the subjects, and the quiz interface stays fixed at the bottom of the frame.",
