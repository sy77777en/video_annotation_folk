    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with long, light brown hair is on a skateboard. She is wearing a beige, oversized, short-sleeved t-shirt over light-wash blue pants and has black knee pads on both knees. On her head, she wears a blue, white, and red helmet with the \"Red Bull\" logo visible on both the side and the front, and the chin strap is fastened. She looks over her shoulder toward the camera, which she holds out in her extended right hand, and has a slight smile on her face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed, captures a skateboarder moving along the curved wall of a large outdoor half-pipe during the daytime. The ramp is made of brown-colored panels, with the word \"BOOSTED\" stenciled in black capital letters on its surface. In the background, a palm tree and metal scaffolding are visible beneath an overcast sky. The skateboarder wears a blue and white helmet featuring a \"Red Bull\" logo as they glide along the structure.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures a woman on a skateboard in the center foreground of the frame. She is positioned on a large half-pipe, with the curved ramp wall extending from the bottom left into the middle ground on the right. In the background, a palm tree and scaffolding are visible in the top left. The camera, held by the woman at her own level, moves with her as she skates from left to right along the ramp. As she moves, the ramp wall and the word \"BOOSTED,\" which appears in the middle ground on the right, slide past her toward the left, while she remains consistently in the center of the frame.",
