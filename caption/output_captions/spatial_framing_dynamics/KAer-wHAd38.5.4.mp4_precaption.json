    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot of a tranquil rural area in Vietnam. The view from a concrete bridge overlooks a muddy brown river, expansive, vibrant green rice paddies, and distant, lushly forested hills under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The camera pans to reveal that the bridge leads to the entrance of a small village, marked by a traditional red ceremonial gate adorned with colorful flags. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the picturesque and serene atmosphere of the countryside, emphasizing the harmonious relationship between the natural landscape and the small community nestled within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A daytime view from a bridge in a rural countryside setting shows a muddy brown river flowing alongside vibrant green rice paddies. In the distance, a small village with houses is nestled at the base of lush, rolling hills under a bright blue sky with white, puffy clouds. A metal utility pole stands in the green fields. The perspective moves across the bridge, which has a gray metal guardrail, revealing a paved road leading toward a large, red welcome gate adorned with colorful flags at the far end.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot. The video begins with an extreme wide shot where a bridge guardrail is in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A muddy river is in the bottom right middle ground, next to green rice paddies that fill the center. In the background, green hills are visible across the top half of the frame, with a village on the left. The camera then pans left, transitioning into a wide shot. The bridge and its guardrails now frame the bottom and sides of the shot, with its paved road leading from the bottom center into the middle ground. At the end of the bridge, a red ceremonial gate is now the central element in the middle ground, with the rice paddies and hills now positioned in the background on the right. The camera is positioned at eye level from the bridge.",
