    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video prominently features a warning sign that reads \"ASBESTOS TAILINGS RISK AREA\" with a red triangle containing an exclamation mark, indicating danger. The sign warns about the risks of inhaling asbestos fibers, which may cause cancer, and advises avoiding dusty situations and keeping children away from the tailings. The sign is mounted on a metal pole and is positioned in a natural setting with rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. The landscape includes reddish-brown rock formations and some green shrubs, suggesting a dry, possibly desert-like environment. The sign is the central focus, emphasizing the hazardous nature of the area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting in a rugged, arid landscape characterized by rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. The scene is dominated by a prominent warning sign that reads \"ASBESTOS TAILINGS RISK AREA\" with a red triangle and exclamation mark, cautioning about the dangers of inhaling asbestos fibers. The sign is mounted on a metal pole and stands against a backdrop of reddish-brown hills and mounds of dark, dusty material, likely tailings. The sky is clear and blue with very few clouds, indicating a sunny day. The environment suggests a remote, possibly abandoned mining area. Overlay elements include a small watermark in the bottom left corner, displaying text that reads \"[5]; [State body of Western Australia]\" and an overlay text box above the watermark displaying the year 1978.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a warning sign labeled \"ASBESTOS TAILINGS RISK AREA,\" which occupies the central portion of the frame. Positioned in the foreground, the sign is mounted on a metal pole and is clearly visible, dominating the scene. In the middle ground, the rocky terrain and sparse vegetation extend outward, with reddish-brown rock formations situated towards the left and right sides of the frame. The background features mounds of dark, dusty material, likely tailings, and additional rocky hills. The sky, occupying the upper part of the frame, is clear and blue with minimal cloud cover. The camera remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective at the subject's level. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the elements within the frame. A small watermark and text overlay appear in the bottom left corner, providing additional context without altering the primary focus on the warning sign and its surroundings.",
