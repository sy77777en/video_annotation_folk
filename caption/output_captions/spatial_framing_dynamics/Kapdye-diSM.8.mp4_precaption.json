    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a cityscape of a quiet, upscale street in a European city. In the foreground, the rear half of a black Porsche Cayenne and a white car are prominently displayed. The midground features a red sports car, a grey Bentley with the license plate \"BY05 NDO,\" a white BMW X1, a white van, and several green trees. The narrow road is lined with grand, historic buildings adorned with ornate stone facades and rows of windows, creating an atmosphere of affluence and architectural heritage. The focus is on capturing the overall environment and atmosphere, highlighting the character and scale of the opulent urban setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person POV, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, the scene unfolds on a narrow street in a European city, flanked by grand, multi-story stone buildings with classical architecture. The lighting is soft under an overcast sky. The asphalt road is marked with white lines for parallel parking, where the rear half of a black SUV and a red sports car are visible on the left, and the rear half of a white car, a dark gray sedan, and a white van are on the right. Green, leafy trees are visible between the buildings, and a black, ornate lamppost stands on the right sidewalk. The perspective moves slowly forward along the street. A red watermark with the white text \"THE STRADMAN\" is positioned in the bottom right corner as an overlay.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a scenery view of a narrow European street from a low-angle perspective. The scene is framed with several vehicles acting as compositional elements. In the foreground, the rear of a black SUV occupies the bottom left, and the rear of a white car is in the bottom right. The street extends from the bottom center into the background, flanked by parked cars in the middle ground\u2014a red car on the left, and a grey sedan and white van on the right. Grand, historic buildings line both sides of the street, extending from the middle ground into the background, where another large building is centered at the far end. A red watermark is positioned in the bottom right corner. The camera maintains this composition as it moves slowly forward down the street.",
