    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a picturesque view down a narrow Venetian canal, framed by weathered, multi-story buildings with shuttered windows on the left side, which appear aged and dirty. The right side of the canal features a small riverside path where a lone pedestrian walks towards the bottom right corner of the frame. A white bird is seen flying out of the frame towards the top right corner. The scene emphasizes the overall environment and atmosphere of this iconic urban waterway, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the unique architectural and aquatic setting, rather than focusing on specific individuals or objects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a view down a narrow canal in Venice, Italy, on an overcast day. The water in the canal is a murky green, with several small, light-colored boats moored along its edges. On the left, an old, weathered multi-story building with faded brownish-pink walls, rectangular windows (some with dark shutters), and a chimney lines the canal. On the right, a long, high reddish-brown brick wall with regularly spaced buttress-like structures runs alongside a paved walkway. A dark metal railing, part of the bridge from which the video is filmed, is visible in the foreground. Further down the canal, a small, arched stone bridge can be seen. A lone bird flies in the grey sky, and a person in a pink jacket walks along the pathway on the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot presents a view looking down a Venetian canal, which occupies the center of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. A dark metal railing is prominent in the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame. On the left side, a weathered, multi-story building with faded walls lines the canal, stretching from the foreground into the middle ground and background. On the right side, a long, high reddish-brown brick wall runs alongside a paved walkway, similarly extending from the foreground into the background. Several small, light-colored boats are moored along the edges of the canal in the middle ground, on both the left and right sides. In the center background, a small, arched stone bridge is visible at the far end of the canal, with the grey sky occupying the top portion of the frame in the background. The camera is static and positioned at a slightly elevated height, as if from a bridge overlooking the scene.",
