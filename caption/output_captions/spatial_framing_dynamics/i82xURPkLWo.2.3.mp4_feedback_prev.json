    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up shot of two men conversing on a balcony. The first man, positioned on the left side of the frame, occupies the foreground, while the second man is on the right, also in the foreground. Both are facing each other, with the first man partially turned towards the second. The ornate architectural details, including decorative columns and a balustrade, form the middle ground and background, extending across the frame. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a close-up, focusing more closely on the men's upper bodies and faces. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. By the end of the video, both men begin moving to the right, shifting their positions within the frame. The camera follows their movement, keeping them centered as they walk. The background architecture remains visible, though less prominent due to the closer framing. The overall spatial dynamics emphasize the interaction between the two men against the backdrop of the detailed setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two men engaged in a conversation on a balcony with ornate architectural details. The first man, on the left, has a buzz cut and is wearing a dark denim jacket, with only about half of his face visible. The second man, on the right, has short, curly hair and is dressed in a dark leather jacket over a brown shirt. They appear to be facing each other, with the second man smiling. The setting includes decorative columns and a balustrade, adding a classic touch to the scene. At the end of the video, both men start walking to the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot showing a character\u2019s upper body in an indoor setting. The environment is a grand, ornate building with classical architectural elements, including decorative columns and intricate moldings. The walls are adorned with detailed carvings and a mix of soft, muted colors like beige and cream. The setting appears to be well-lit, suggesting daytime, with natural light filtering through unseen windows. The floor is scattered with debris, adding a slightly neglected feel to the otherwise elegant surroundings. The scene captures a sense of historical grandeur with its elaborate design and spacious layout.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
