    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a man, capturing him from above. Initially, he is positioned in the center of the frame, crouching on a concrete surface in the foreground. His 2D position is central, while his 3D position places him in the foreground. As he transitions from a crouching to a kneeling stance, raising his arms, the camera remains above him, maintaining the same height relative to the subject. The man then disappears from the frame as the camera tilts upwards. Following this, the shot size expands to a wide shot, showing a broader view of the urban environment. The new scene includes a city street with vehicles such as a white van and a dark car, which occupy various positions across the frame. These vehicles are in the middle ground, with buildings forming the background. The camera continues to tilt upward, capturing more of the street and the surrounding structures, concluding midway through the transition. The initial and final states show a clear shift from focusing on the individual subject to showcasing the larger urban setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a bald man wearing a light blue long-sleeve shirt and dark pants, initially positioned in a crouching stance with his arms bent and fists clenched. He then leans back into a kneeling position, raising his arms straight and looking upwards. The camera tilts upwards, causing the man to disappear from view. The scene transitions to a broader view of the urban environment, revealing a city street with several vehicles, including a white van and a dark car. The shot concludes midway through the camera tilt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor urban setting from an objective point of view. It begins with a view of a man in a light blue shirt and dark pants kneeling on a concrete surface, his posture suggesting movement or action. The concrete is smooth and gray, with subtle texture visible. As the camera elevates, it reveals another person on the left and a black sedan on the right. The scene transitions to a broader view of a city street as the camera tilts, lined with buildings and vehicles. The street is straight, with a clear division for lanes, and the buildings are tall, casting shadows on the road. The time of day appears to be daytime, with natural light illuminating the scene. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, with a sense of motion as the perspective shifts from the individual to the bustling city environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
