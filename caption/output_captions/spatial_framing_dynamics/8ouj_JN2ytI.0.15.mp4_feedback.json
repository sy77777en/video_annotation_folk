    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a football player is positioned in the right side of the frame, shown from the back and his right side. He stands in the middle ground on a football field that occupies the bottom of the frame. In the background, a large, out-of-focus crowd fills the stadium stands. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. The player briefly raises his right arm while his position within the static frame remains unchanged.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, a football player, is seen from the back and side standing on a football field. He wears a white jersey with blue sleeves and green stripes on the shoulders. The name \"RAVENSTAH\" is partially visible in blue letters across the back, and the jersey number appears to be \"10,\" though it is not fully clear and could be a number like \"18.\" He has on a blue helmet with a white facemask and a green and white logo on the side that includes the letters \"BCM.\" He briefly raises his right arm. In the background, a large crowd of spectators, mostly wearing yellow, is visible in the stadium stands. Additionally, a few more football players wearing the same blue and white uniforms are on the field, with one player having the number \"54\" clearly visible on the front of his jersey.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor football stadium is seen during a daytime game from a perspective on the field. In the foreground, a football player is shown from behind, wearing a white jersey with blue and green trim. The name on the jersey appears to be \"RAVENSTAH,\" but it is partially obscured, and only part of the number is visible, making it unclear if it is \"10.\" His helmet is blue with a white facemask and a green and white logo. The green grass of the field is marked with white lines. In the background, the stadium stands are filled with a large, out-of-focus crowd predominantly wearing yellow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
