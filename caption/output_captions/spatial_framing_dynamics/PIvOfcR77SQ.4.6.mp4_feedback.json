    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a snowy landscape under a vast sky. Initially, the camera focuses on the sky, occupying most of the upper portion of the frame, while the lower part reveals the top of a yurt in the foreground, positioned slightly off-center to the left. As the video progresses, the camera pans down and to the right, gradually revealing more of the snowy terrain and additional yurts scattered across the middle ground. These yurts are distributed unevenly, with some closer to the foreground and others further back. The line of bare trees forms a natural border in the background, stretching horizontally across the frame near the horizon. The camera remains at a consistent height, capturing the scene from a level perspective relative to the yurts. Throughout the video, the sky maintains its dominance in the upper half of the frame, transitioning from a bright blue to softer hues near the horizon, indicating the time of day. The spatial composition shifts from a focus on the sky to a broader view of the landscape, emphasizing the expanse and tranquility of the environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the expansive environment, highlighting the vastness of the sky and the snowy landscape. The emphasis is on the atmosphere and scale, rather than any specific object, creating a sense of openness and tranquility.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor winter scene with a vast, open blue sky with some clouds. The setting is a snowy landscape featuring several yurts, which are round, tent-like structures with white coverings. Snow blankets the ground, creating a pristine, undisturbed surface. In the background, a line of bare trees stands against the horizon, adding a natural border to the scene. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as the sky displays a mix of blue and soft, warm hues from the setting sun. The overall atmosphere is calm and serene, with the snow reflecting the subtle colors of the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
