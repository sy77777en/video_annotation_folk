    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an underwater scenery shot depicting the tiled walls of a swimming pool. The small, square tiles are a muted, dark green, and the water around them is slightly murky, creating a dim and somber atmosphere. In the center of the frame, a patch of tiles appears darker and irregularly shaped, suggesting a stain or repair. The video lacks a main subject, as the focus is entirely on the quiet, submerged environment. The shot's purpose is to convey a specific mood through the visual texture of the tiles and the quality of the underwater light, rather than to follow a particular character or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a perspective looking up at the pool wall, the surface is visible, lined with a grid of small, square, greenish-grey tiles. The water imparts a murky, green hue to the scene and creates a slight wavering distortion of the tiles. A darker, irregularly shaped patch rests on the tiled surface in the center of the view. The water's surface can be seen along the top edge, reflecting dim, diffuse light.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static, close-up scenery shot filmed from a high-angle, underwater perspective looking down at a swimming pool floor. The grid of greenish-grey tiles fills the entire frame. In the center of the frame, there is a darker, irregularly shaped patch on the tiled surface. The water's surface is visible as a thin, bright line along the top edge of the frame. The composition remains completely still throughout the video.",
