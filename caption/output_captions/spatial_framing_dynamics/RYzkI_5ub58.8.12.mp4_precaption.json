    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a close-up view of an insect, likely a moth or skipper, resting on a thick, bright green plant stem. The insect's body is predominantly dark, possibly greenish-brown, and covered in fine hairs, with a distinct patch of dense, orange-yellow hairs on the top of its head. Its wings, held partially open and angled upwards over its back, are dark with subtle greenish and brownish hues, and feature a noticeable, iridescent purple or blue spot on the visible upper surface. The insect has long, slender, black antennae that are slightly thickened or clubbed at the tips and extend forward. Its large, compound eyes are a prominent reddish-brown. Several slender, dark legs with fine bristles are visible, with the insect using them to cling to the textured surface of the green stem.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a macro, close-up view, a moth-like insect with brownish-green wings rests on a plant stem that appears thick due to the macro perspective. The insect has a fuzzy, orange-hued head, dark compound eyes, and long, thin black antennae. A small, iridescent purple spot is visible on one of its wings. The background is a soft-focus blur of green and light blue, with a noticeable yellow blur, suggesting an outdoor, sunlit environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures an insect in the foreground, positioned in the center-left of the frame. The insect rests on a green plant stem that extends diagonally from the bottom left corner towards the top left. The background consists of a soft-focus blur of green, yellow, and light blue. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the framing remains static throughout the video.",
