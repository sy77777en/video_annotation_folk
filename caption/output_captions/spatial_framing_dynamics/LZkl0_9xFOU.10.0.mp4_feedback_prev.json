In the middle ground, a second mannequin wearing an \"ATOMIC\" t-shirt stands in the center-left. To its left, also in the middle ground, is a sign for toilets.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the foreground, a faceless mannequin with short brown hair, wearing a light purple-grey t-shirt and blue jeans, leans over a black laptop resting on a table. In the middle ground and slightly to the left, a grey, mannequin-like figure with a smooth, featureless grey head stands still. This figure is dressed in a dark grey t-shirt that has the word \"ATOMIC\" printed on the chest in white.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a modern indoor space with a teal and pink glow. In the background, a mannequin wearing a dark grey t-shirt with the word \"ATOMIC\" stands next to a wall with a chain-link fence pattern. Nearby, a sign with an arrow and toilet symbols is located on the left side of the mannequin, on a door-shaped dark structure. A large screen is displayed on the chain-link fence wall, showing a scene from a video game. The foreground features a patterned counter holding a black laptop and a white square device, and a dark electronic device with glowing, multi-colored lights. A person in a grey t-shirt and jeans leans over the counter, as if interacting with the laptop. White subtitles are present as an overlay at the bottom left of the screen, with white text on a dark background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a medium full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
