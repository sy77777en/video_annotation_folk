    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young man wearing a white t-shirt over a black long-sleeved shirt, brown pants, and a black beanie, holding a skateboard. After placing the board down, he is initially seen skateboarding on a sidewalk, surrounded by several people in the background, including a woman in a long beige coat and a man in a dark jacket, with the man being the only one wearing a mask. Both individuals in the background have their faces blurred. The young man then moves towards a set of stairs, where he is seen crouching, possibly preparing to skateboard down the steps. The focus remains on his actions and attire, with other individuals present but less prominently featured.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor urban setting during the day, featuring a modern cityscape with a mix of concrete structures and glass windows and doors. The scene includes a sidewalk with a small grassy area and a bus stop, where several people are present, some wearing masks. A skateboarder is seen navigating the environment, moving along the sidewalk and up a slope. The buildings are characterized by clean lines and neutral colors, with metal railings and stone surfaces. The weather is clear, allowing for unobstructed views of the surroundings. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, with the skateboarder's movement contrasting the stillness of the other pedestrians.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a full shot capturing an urban scene. Initially, the main subject, a skateboarder, is positioned in the bottom left foreground, moving towards the center. In the left middle ground, a woman in a beige coat and a man in a dark jacket walk away from the camera. Several other people stand in the center and right background near a bus stop structure. A set of stairs with a metal railing occupies the right foreground and middle ground. The skateboarder moves diagonally across the frame from the bottom left towards the right middle ground, ascending a slope alongside the stairs. He comes to a stop near the top right middle ground, crouching beside the railing. The camera remains stationary and positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
