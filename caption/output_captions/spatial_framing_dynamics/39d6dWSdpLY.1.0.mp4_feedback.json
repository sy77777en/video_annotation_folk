    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full, forward-facing shot of a snowboarder positioned in the center foreground, captured with a fisheye lens. In the middle ground, other skiers are visible on the slope, with ski lift towers in the top left and a mountain peak in the center-right background. The camera, initially held at the subject's height, follows them as they ride toward a ramp. As the snowboarder launches into a backflip, the camera inverts with them, causing the subject to move to the top of the frame while the snowy ground, a ramp, and another mid-air skier occupy the middle ground below. The shot concludes as the snowboarder lands, returning to the center foreground with the camera once again at their height and facing forward down the slope.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a person snowboarding down a snowy slope, wearing a bright yellow hoodie, black pants, a black helmet, and black gloves. Their snowboard has a black top surface and a colorful graphic on the bottom that includes the words \"SUPRATEAM\" and \"SNOW PARK.\" This snowboarder is shown performing an aerial flip. In the background and midground, several other people are also on the slope. One skier, dressed in a red jacket and black pants, is captured mid-air during a jump. Other individuals in various winter attire are seen skiing and snowboarding further down the mountain.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A dynamic shot, captured with a fisheye lens, follows a snowboarder down a wide, snow-covered mountain slope at a ski resort. The scene takes place on a bright, sunny day under a clear, deep blue sky, with the sun casting distinct shadows on the snow. In the background, a large mountain peak rises above the landscape, which is dotted with evergreen trees. Ski lift towers and cables are visible on the side of the slope. As the camera follows the main snowboarder, who is wearing a yellow hoodie and black helmet, they perform a backflip. Other skiers and snowboarders are also present on the slope, with some seen in the air after launching from a snow ramp. The snowboard itself is black with colorful text and graphics.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: A skier films himself with a selfie stick camera. At first, the camera is roughly at the same height as the skier. As he rides up a ramp and launches into the air, the camera is above him, then returns to the same height once he lands after completing a flip",
