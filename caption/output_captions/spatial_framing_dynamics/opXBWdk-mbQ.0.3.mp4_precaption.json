    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A series of pre-portioned meals are displayed in clear, rectangular containers, organized by day of the week on a white surface. Each day is labeled with a bright yellow sticky note with the day written in black marker. The \"MONDAY\" meal consists of a salad with mixed greens, shredded red cabbage, shredded carrots, cashews, sliced chicken breast, and avocado, with a separate container of baby carrots. The \"TUESDAY\" meal features sliced chicken over a bed of grains, accompanied by roasted sweet potatoes, broccoli, and asparagus, with two smaller side containers holding almonds and a white, creamy dip. The \"WEDNESDAY\" meal includes two folded white tortillas in one container and a separate container with a filling of chicken and fresh cilantro.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a top-down perspective on a white surface, a series of pre-prepared meals in clear, rectangular containers are arranged in a row. The camera pans from left to right, revealing each day's food. Yellow sticky notes labeled \"MONDAY,\" \"TUESDAY,\" and \"WEDNESDAY\" identify the meals. Monday's meal is a salad with sliced chicken, cashews, red cabbage, and avocado, with a separate container of baby carrots. Tuesday's meal contains sliced chicken, rice, asparagus, and broccoli, with smaller containers of almonds and a white dip. The final meal shown, for Wednesday, consists of folded tortillas next to a container with a chicken and cilantro filling.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot, filmed from a top-down perspective, initially displays two sets of pre-portioned meals on a white surface. The \"MONDAY\" meal is positioned on the left side of the frame, while the \"TUESDAY\" meal is on the right. A yellow sticky note is located at the top left and top right, above each respective meal. The camera then pans horizontally from left to right. As it moves, the \"MONDAY\" meal exits the frame on the left, the \"TUESDAY\" meal shifts to the center, and a new \"WEDNESDAY\" meal, along with its corresponding sticky note, enters from the right, coming to rest on the right side of the frame.",
