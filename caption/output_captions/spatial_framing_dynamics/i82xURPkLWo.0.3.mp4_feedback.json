    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle, wide scenery shot where railway tracks on a gravel bed occupy the foreground, curving from the bottom right to the bottom left. In the middle ground, poles supporting overhead wires are positioned on the left and right sides of the tracks, with green fields stretching behind them towards a line of low hills in the background. The sky fills the top half of the frame. A high-speed train then enters from the right middle ground, moving rapidly to the left. As it approaches the center, it increases in size, transitioning to an extreme close-up that fills the entire horizontal width of the frame before it continues its motion and exits on the left, returning the scene to its initial static composition. The camera remains at a fixed low height relative to the tracks throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially shows a railway track with a brown gravel bed, multiple parallel steel rails, and overhead catenary wires. A white high-speed train with three prominent blue horizontal stripes along its length and dark, elongated windows then enters from the right. The train has a rounded, aerodynamic front and briefly fills the view as it passes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective positioned beside the railway track, the scene captures a wide, rural landscape. The rusty brown tracks extend from right to left, with the middle section appearing to curve toward the viewer, likely due to the fisheye lens effect. Poles supporting overhead catenary wires flank the tracks. In the distance, green fields stretch towards a line of low hills under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. A modern, white high-speed train with blue horizontal stripes enters the scene from the right, speeding past the camera in a blur of motion before disappearing off-screen to the left.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The scene begins with a scenery shot, before a train enters the frame from the right side, occupying the entire frame until it disapears off screen to the left. \n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject, and the camera height remains unchanged.",
