    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man as the main subject, who is wearing a dark denim jacket over a black shirt. He has a buzz cut and a trimmed beard. The man appears to be engaged in a conversation, as his facial expression changes slightly throughout the video. A secondary subject, another man, becomes visible when he stands up. He has curly hair and is wearing a dark leather jacket. The two men are facing each other, suggesting an interaction or dialogue between them. The setting includes a large, abstract painting in the background, adding a colorful backdrop to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV, the scene is set indoors, with two men standing before a large, distressed wall mural. The camera is positioned behind one man in a black jacket, looking toward the other. The mural behind them features abstract, flowing shapes in shades of red and orange against a dark, textured background, with parts of the surface appearing worn or peeled away.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a man in a denim jacket stands in the center-left of the frame and in the middle ground. In the right foreground, the back of a second man in a leather jacket is initially visible as he is bent over. The second man then stands up, his back and head occupying the right side of the frame, creating an over-the-shoulder perspective that keeps the focus on the first man. A large, abstract mural is positioned in the background behind them. The camera remains stationary and at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
