    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man as the main subject, who is wearing a dark denim jacket over a black shirt. He has a buzz cut and a trimmed beard. The man appears to be engaged in a conversation, as his facial expression changes slightly throughout the video. A secondary subject, another man, becomes visible when he stands up. He has curly hair and is wearing a dark leather jacket. The two men are facing each other, suggesting an interaction or dialogue between them. The setting includes a large, abstract painting in the background, adding a colorful backdrop to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video features a third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot capturing a character\u2019s upper body in a setting that could be interpreted as either indoor or outdoor, possibly on an overcast day. The environment showcases a large, abstract mural with dark and warm tones, including deep reds and blacks, creating a dramatic backdrop. The characters are positioned in front of this mural, with one character facing the viewer and the other partially visible from behind. The lighting is soft, suggesting a space with controlled illumination. The characters wear casual clothing, with denim and leather textures adding to the scene's contemporary feel. The overall atmosphere is intimate, focusing on the interaction between the characters against the striking mural.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of two men engaged in a conversation. The main subject, a man in a dark denim jacket, occupies the left side of the frame, positioned in the foreground. His counterpart, wearing a dark leather jacket, is initially less prominent but gradually moves into clearer view on the right side of the frame, also in the foreground. Both subjects face each other, indicating a direct interaction. The background features a large, abstract mural with vibrant colors, situated behind the men in the middle ground. The camera remains at eye level with the subjects throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning, keeping the focus steady on the interaction between the two men. The mural serves as a static backdrop, enhancing the visual context without altering its position or prominence.",
