    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from a first-person perspective, positioned just above the water level. Initially, the bottom half of the frame is occupied by water, which extends from the foreground to the middle ground. A platform with a railing is visible in the right foreground. In the middle ground, two brightly lit windows are on the left side of the frame, and a dark, arched doorway is centered. The camera then moves steadily forward through the water, causing the platform on the right to exit the frame. As the camera advances, the central archway becomes larger and moves from the middle ground to the foreground, while the windows on the left shift toward the periphery of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an interior scenery shot of a minimalist, tiled room with water. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the serene and somewhat mysterious ambiance created by the lighting and reflections on the water. There is no main subject, as the emphasis is on the architectural space and its interaction with light and water. This type of shot could serve as an establishing shot, setting the scene by providing context and mood, or as an FPV shot, creating an immersive experience by drawing the viewer into the tranquil setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moves through a room partially filled with dark green water. The walls and curved ceiling are covered in a grid of small, light-colored tiles. On the left wall, two arched windows emit a bright, diffuse white light that reflects on the rippling water's surface. Directly ahead, a dark, arched doorway is partially submerged in the water. To the right, a white platform with a simple metal railing stands above the water level. The perspective advances steadily through the water toward the dark archway.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
