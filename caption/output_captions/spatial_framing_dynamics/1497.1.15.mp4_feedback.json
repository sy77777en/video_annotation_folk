In the right foreground, a person in a red shirt is positioned, moving toward the left. In the center-background, a man sits at a dining table set before dark green curtains, while another individual is hunched over beside him.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, turbulent mass of clear, bluish water and what appears to be ice splashes violently from the left. In the foreground, a person is seen in profile, wearing a red short-sleeved shirt over a white collared shirt and dark pants, appearing to jump towards the flowing water. In the background, a fair-skinned man with short reddish-brown hair, dressed in a red long-sleeved shirt, is seated at a dining table covered with a white tablecloth. In front of him, another individual, dressed entirely in dark clothing, is sitting on a chair, hunched over and attempting to hide under the table.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a formal dining hall with dark green curtains, a lit chandelier, and classical columns, a large volume of turbulent, bluish water and shattered ice violently erupts from the left. The water splashes across the room, where a dining table with a white tablecloth is set. In the foreground, a person is visible in profile, wearing a red short-sleeve shirt over a white collared shirt and dark pants, appearing to jump towards the flowing water. In the background, a fair-skinned man with short reddish-brown hair, dressed in a red long-sleeve shirt, is seated at the dining table. In front of him, another individual, dressed entirely in dark clothing, is sitting on a chair, hunched over and attempting to hide under the table. A watermark for \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" is present in the bottom left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
