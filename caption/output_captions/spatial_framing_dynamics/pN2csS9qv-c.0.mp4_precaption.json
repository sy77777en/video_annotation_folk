    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a gymnastics event with a focus on a female gymnast performing on the uneven bars. She is wearing a red leotard and is captured in motion, showcasing her athleticism and skill. Around her, several individuals are present, including coaches and judges. The coaches, dressed in dark clothing, are positioned near the gymnast, likely providing support and guidance. Judges are seated at a table, observing the performance. In the background, spectators are visible in the stands, watching the event. The setting is a gymnasium with banners and equipment indicating a competitive gymnastics environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor gymnastics arena with a high ceiling and bright artificial lighting. The setting features a large gymnastics floor surrounded by equipment, including uneven bars and mats. The environment is bustling with activity, as gymnasts and coaches move around the equipment. Spectators are primarily seated in bleachers in the background and on the right side, watching the events unfold. The arena is decorated with banners and signage, displaying team names and logos. The floor is marked with blue and white colors, and there is also a wooden floor present. The scene is lively, with people engaged in various activities related to the gymnastics event.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, a gymnast in a red leotard is positioned in the center of the frame, performing on a set of uneven bars located in the middle ground. A coach stands in the left foreground near the bars, while another coach is in the middle ground to the right of the apparatus. Judges are seated at a table directly behind the bars in the middle ground, with spectators filling the stands in the background across the top of the frame. The gymnast moves dynamically around the central apparatus, transitioning between the high and low bars. Her routine culminates in a dismount where she flies from the bars and lands on a mat in the middle ground, slightly to the right of the apparatus's center. Throughout her performance, the coaches in the foreground and middle ground adjust their positions slightly, but the overall camera framing remains unchanged.",
