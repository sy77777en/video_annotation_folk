    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a gymnastics event with a focus on a female gymnast performing on the uneven bars. She is wearing a red leotard and is captured in motion, showcasing her athleticism and skill. Around her, several individuals are present, including coaches and judges. The coaches, dressed in dark clothing, are positioned near the gymnast, likely providing support and guidance. Judges are seated at a table, observing the performance. In the background, spectators are visible in the stands, watching the event. The setting is a gymnasium with banners and equipment indicating a competitive gymnastics environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor gymnastics arena with a high ceiling and bright artificial lighting. The setting features a large gymnastics floor surrounded by equipment, including uneven bars and mats. The environment is bustling with activity, as gymnasts and coaches move around the equipment. Spectators are primarily seated in bleachers in the background and on the right side, watching the events unfold. The arena is decorated with banners and signage, displaying team names and logos. The floor is marked with blue and white colors, and the equipment is primarily blue with metallic elements. The scene is lively, with people engaged in various activities related to the gymnastics event.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is presented in a wide shot, encompassing the uneven bars apparatus, the surrounding mat area, and the background seating. The uneven bars are located in the center middle ground. The primary subject, a gymnast, performs her routine in the center of the frame, moving dynamically between the high and low bars within the middle ground. A coach stands in the bottom left foreground/middle ground, close to the apparatus. Another coach is positioned in the center-right middle ground. Judges are seated at a table in the center-left middle ground. Other individuals, including athletes and staff, are positioned around the floor area in the middle ground, primarily to the left and right. Spectators are visible seated in the stands across the background, occupying the upper half of the frame. Banners hang in the top center background. The gymnast's position changes constantly within the central area as she executes her routine, culminating in a dismount towards the right side of the apparatus in the middle ground. The coaches adjust their positions slightly in response to the gymnast's movements. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level.",
