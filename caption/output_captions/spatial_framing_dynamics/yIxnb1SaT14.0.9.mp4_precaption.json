    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, capturing the majestic facade of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris at night. The grand Gothic structure, with its two iconic towers and large rose window, is brilliantly illuminated against a dark, moody sky. Initially appearing in the middleground, a large Christmas tree, densely wrapped in glowing blue and white lights, gradually transitions to the foreground as the camera moves, enhancing the dynamic composition of the scene. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on the overall atmosphere and scale of the environment, using the interplay of architectural grandeur and festive lighting to create a powerful sense of place and occasion.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A nighttime shot slowly zooms in on the illuminated facade of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. The Gothic stone building, featuring two prominent towers and a large central rose window, is brightly lit against the dark sky. In front of the cathedral's entrance stands a large, cone-shaped Christmas tree adorned with bright blue lights. In the plaza, people are visible, and to the right, ornate, multi-globed street lamps cast a white light. The scene is framed by black letterbox bars at the top and bottom, and a white text overlay in the bottom right corner displays \"MATHIEU STANI\u0106\" with \"PHOTOGRAPHER\" and \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" appearing underneath.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
    "pre_caption": "This scenery video begins with an extreme wide shot of the Notre-Dame Cathedral, captured from a low angle. The cathedral is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground and background. In the middle ground, a large, illuminated Christmas tree stands in the bottom left, with other buildings to its left and people scattered across the bottom of the frame. Ornate street lamps are visible in the middle ground on the right. The camera then slowly zooms in, transitioning the scene into a wide shot. This movement brings the cathedral's facade closer, causing it to fill more of the frame while remaining centered. Consequently, the Christmas tree shifts into the foreground on the left, and the street lamps are pushed further toward the right edge. The entire scene is framed by black letterbox bars at the top and bottom, with a text overlay in the bottom right corner.",
