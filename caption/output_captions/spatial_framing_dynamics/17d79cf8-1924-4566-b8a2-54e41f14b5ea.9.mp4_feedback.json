    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the shot looks down at a person's hands and body. The person's legs and torso occupy the bottom of the frame in the immediate foreground. In the center foreground, their hands are shown pressing a brick into a horizontal row that extends across the middle ground. A white guide string is stretched taut just in front of the bricks. A green bucket with mortar is positioned in the bottom-left middle ground. The background, visible at the top of the frame, consists of a lower level with a coiled black hose in the top-left and a concrete ledge in the top-right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a man with brown skin is shown laying a course of rectangular, reddish-orange bricks. His hands and forearms are covered in wet, grey mortar. He wears a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and dark shorts with a repeating yellow and pinkish circular pattern. A black watch or band is visible on his right wrist. The rough-textured bricks are being set in a line on a bed of the grey mortar. To his left, a green plastic basin contains more of the wet mortar and a small trowel with an orange handle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, looks down at a construction task taking place outdoors during the day on the second floor. On a patch of uneven dirt ground, a person's hands press a rectangular, red-orange brick into a line of similar bricks held together by wet, dark gray mortar. A white string rests on the stairs on the right side of the frame. The person's legs, clad in patterned shorts, are visible at the bottom of the view. Nearby, a green plastic bucket contains more mortar, and in the background, green vegetation and rocks are visible near a concrete ledge, along with a coiled black hose and other construction debris.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
