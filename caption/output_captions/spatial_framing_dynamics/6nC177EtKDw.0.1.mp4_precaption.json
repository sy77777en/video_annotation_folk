    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a low-angle perspective in a black-and-white video, two figures stand on the deck of a boat, shrouded in dense, gray fog. They are presented as dark silhouettes, though they appear to be men wearing what resemble sailor's caps. They stand still and side-by-side, facing forward. Their lower bodies are obscured by a wooden structure in the immediate foreground, likely the bow of a smaller boat, which has ropes running along its surface and occupies the bottom half of the view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective at the bow of a small wooden boat, the scene is enveloped in dense, dark fog. The pointed bow, with ropes stretched across its weathered surface, juts forward into the gloom. Two indistinct figures, wearing caps, stand on the deck, their forms obscured by the monochromatic and grainy atmosphere. Faint vertical lines, possibly rigging, are visible in the background, completing the obscure maritime setting.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows two people standing at the bow of a boat, filmed from behind. A wooden object in the foreground occupies the lower half of the frame, partially blocking the part of the people, so only the upper bodies of the people are visible, occupying the top half of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static, low-angle medium shot. In the foreground, the bow of a wooden boat is positioned centrally, occupying the bottom half of the frame. In the middle ground, the upper bodies of two figures are visible, standing side-by-side in the top center of the frame. The background consists of dense fog, with faint vertical lines visible behind the subjects.",
