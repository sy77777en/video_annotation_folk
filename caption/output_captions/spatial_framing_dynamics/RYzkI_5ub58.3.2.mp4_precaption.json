    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A spotted hyena with light brown to reddish-brown fur, which appears slightly damp on its head, stands in tall grass that is a vibrant mix of yellow and green hues. It has prominent, rounded ears that are dark on the inside and a dark snout. The hyena is facing forward, looking directly at the viewer, with some blades of grass partially obscuring its lower body and chest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A hyena with coarse, orange-brown fur stands in a field of tall grass, a mix of bright yellow and vibrant green, under bright daylight. The animal has dark, rounded ears and a dark snout. Thin blades of grass in the foreground partially obscure the hyena's abdomen and part of its body. The background is a softly blurred expanse of the same sunlit, mixed-color grassland.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A hyena is featured in a medium shot, positioned in the center of the frame and situated in the middle ground. Thin blades of tall grass are visible in the foreground, partially obscuring the lower portion of the hyena's body. The animal is surrounded by more grass in the middle ground, which extends into a blurred background. The camera remains static at the hyena's level throughout the shot.",
