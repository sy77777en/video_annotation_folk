    "pre_caption": "In an extreme close-up shot, a smartphone circuit board is held in the center of the frame in the middle ground by a pair of hands. The left hand is visible on the left and bottom, while the right hand enters from the top right, holding a screwdriver. The screwdriver's tip, positioned in the center, initially points at the top camera lens on the board and then moves down to indicate the middle lens. A blurry white surface with indistinct components occupies the background. The camera is positioned directly above the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pair of light-skinned hands holds a blue smartphone circuit board, which features a prominent, vertically aligned triple-camera module and a silver-colored metal shield. The right hand holds a silver-colored screwdriver with a hexagonal handle, using its pointed tip to touch and indicate the different camera lenses on the module. The left hand, which has a ring on the ring finger, steadies the circuit board during this close examination. The screwdriver's tip is shown pointing at the top lens and then the larger, middle lens.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective shows a pair of hands holding a blue smartphone motherboard against a white surface. The board features a prominent triple-camera module with lenses arranged vertically, next to a square, silver-colored metal shield. A person uses a silver, metallic screwdriver with a hexagonal handle to point at and touch the different camera lenses on the module. In the background, slightly out of focus, are some wires and possibly the smartphone itself on the white surface.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
