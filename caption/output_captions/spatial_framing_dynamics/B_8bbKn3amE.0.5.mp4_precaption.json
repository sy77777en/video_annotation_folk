    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dynamic aerial cityscape scenery shot, captured from the perspective of a fast-moving drone. The camera swoops and glides over a dense, sprawling city built on a mountainside, characterized by its ubiquitous red-orange terracotta-tiled roofs and white-walled buildings. The exhilarating flight path navigates through narrow gaps and over rooftops, eventually revealing a historic-looking white church with a brick bell tower perched on a higher elevation. There is no single main subject, as the rapid, immersive camera movement is designed to showcase the overall scale, atmosphere, and unique architectural texture of the city itself, rather than isolating a specific focal point.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone flies low and fast over the dense, reddish-brown terracotta tile roofs of a city built on a hillside. The buildings have white and off-white walls, with some featuring blue or green window frames. In the background, large, arid mountains rise under a clear blue sky with a few light clouds. The drone's path moves towards a white church with a brick bell tower, which sits on an elevated piece of land with stone retaining walls and a set of stairs leading up to it.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a high-angle, fast-moving aerial perspective. Initially, the frame is filled with the dense, red-tiled roofs of a hillside city, which extend from the foreground at the bottom to the background at the top, with mountains visible in the distant background. The camera swoops rapidly forward and down, causing the rooftops to rush past in the immediate foreground. As the camera banks and turns, the frame tilts dramatically, navigating through the city's architecture. The shot concludes by revealing a white church in the middle ground, positioned slightly left of center, with surrounding rooftops occupying the foreground at the bottom of the frame.",
