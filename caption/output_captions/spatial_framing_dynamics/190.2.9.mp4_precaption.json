    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man with a goatee is shown from the chest up, looking directly forward. He wears a brown fedora with a black band, dark sunglasses, and a rust-colored collared shirt. On his left hand, he wears a large, futuristic-looking finger brace. The brace is primarily silver and white with a rectangular face and a wide band that has blue stripes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place on a sunlit, tree-lined city street during the daytime. In the background, multi-story brownstone buildings with visible windows line the asphalt road. Lush green foliage and bushes are present along the sidewalk, partially enclosed by a low, black metal fence on the left. A prominent tree trunk stands on the right side of the view, and a single car is visible in the distance down the street.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center foreground, looking directly at the camera, which is at his level. He holds a large brace in his left hand, which is visible in the bottom right of the frame. In the background, a city street extends from the center towards the back. Brownstone buildings line the street in the background on both the left and right. In the middle ground, green foliage and a low fence are on the left, while a large tree trunk is on the right.",
