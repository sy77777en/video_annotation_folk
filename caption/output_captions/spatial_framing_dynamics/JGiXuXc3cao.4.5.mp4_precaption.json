    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, cylindrical, metallic-looking probe hangs from a thin cable, casting two wide beams of light onto a dark gray, textured surface below. On this surface rests a small, dark gray, irregularly shaped rock with a lumpy texture, its top displaying varying colors due to the reflection caused by the light exposure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A small, cylindrical probe hangs suspended by a thin cable from an unseen point above. The probe casts two wide, translucent beams of light downward, illuminating the textured, grey ground. A dark strip remains unlit directly beneath the probe, while the light reveals the terrain on either side. A small, dark, irregularly shaped rock rests on the ground to the left. The perspective slowly moves closer to the ground, focusing on the rock as the light beams sweep across the surface.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a space with a black background and gray ground. It begins with an extreme wide shot of a hanging lighting stuff and an object on the ground. The camera then moves left and descends, gradually focusing on the object on the ground.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The video features two subjects initially, with the camera height likely positioned between them. However, when the focus shifts solely to the object on the ground, the camera height adjusts to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot from a high-angle perspective. A probe hangs in the top center of the frame in the middle ground, suspended from a cable that extends off-screen. Below, a textured ground surface occupies the bottom portion of the frame in the background, with a small rock positioned on the left. The camera then pans left and tilts down, moving closer to the ground. During this movement, the probe and its light beams shift toward the right side of the frame and eventually move out of view, while the rock transitions from the left to the center of the frame. The shot resolves into a high-angle close-up, with the rock now centered and occupying the foreground.",
