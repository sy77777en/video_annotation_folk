    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a large semi-truck, which consists of a dark brown or black tractor unit and a long, white, rectangular trailer. The trailer has a futuristic or specialized appearance, with a prominent geometric design on its side that frames a stylized \"W\" or \"M\" logo. The front corner of the trailer is marked with red and white diagonal stripes. Following the semi-truck is a smaller, olive-green armored military vehicle, which appears to be acting as an escort. This secondary vehicle has a boxy build and a turret or weapon mount on its roof.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A black semi-truck pulling a long, white, futuristic-style trailer travels down a four-lane asphalt highway. The trailer features a large, geometric, window-like design on its side and red and white diagonal stripes on its front corner. The scene takes place during the day in a vast, arid desert landscape with low, rolling hills visible in the distance under a bright, partly cloudy sky. Following the semi-truck is a smaller, green, armored military vehicle. Both vehicles are in motion, casting long shadows on the road as the desert scenery blurs past.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a large semi-truck is positioned in the left and center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. To its right and slightly behind it, a smaller armored military vehicle is also in the middle ground. Both vehicles are moving forward and slightly toward the right along a highway that stretches from the bottom of the frame into the background. The camera tracks alongside the convoy, maintaining a consistent framing as the desert scenery in the background blurs past. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
