    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a young boy with pale skin, wearing a bright red long-sleeved shirt and dark pants. He is singled out by a spotlight, standing with his shoulders hunched forward. Surrounding him are numerous other pale-skinned, human-like figures dressed uniformly in dark, non-descript clothing. These figures, which appear to be both male and female, lack distinct facial features. A large group of them stands clustered together to the left, while several others are scattered individually around the boy, some standing still and others walking slowly with a similar hunched posture. The boy's red shirt makes him the only point of color, creating a stark contrast with the monochrome appearance of all the other figures in the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person 3D game video shows a scene inside a vast, dark warehouse-like structure. The environment is rendered in a monochromatic style, with high ceilings, exposed beams, and large, high-up windows. A single spotlight hangs from the ceiling, casting a bright, circular beam onto the dark floor, which is marked with yellow lines. In the background, a large open doorway reveals a foggy exterior with a bare tree and the silhouette of a bus. Numerous stylized, faceless figures in dark clothing are scattered throughout the space, some standing in a group while others are positioned individually. A single figure wearing a red shirt stands directly within the spotlight's beam.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static, high-angle wide shot, the main subject, a boy in a red shirt, stands in the center-left of the frame and in the middle ground, directly under a spotlight cast from a fixture at the top of the frame. A large group of figures is clustered to the left in the middle ground, while several other individual figures are scattered around the boy, also in the middle ground. In the background, a large doorway is positioned in the center-right, through which a bus and a tree are visible.",
