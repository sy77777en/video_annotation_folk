    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An aerial view shows a rally-style car, which is white with red and blue markings, driving at speed along a pale sandy path marked with deep ruts from frequent vehicle use. The car kicks up a large plume of light-colored dust that trails behind it as it navigates the curves. The path cuts through a vast desert landscape composed of large, rolling, golden-brown sand dunes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an overhead view of a vast desert landscape bathed in the warm, golden light of early morning or late afternoon. The scene is dominated by large, rolling sand dunes in shades of brown and tan, their curved ridges creating a pattern of light and shadow. A pale, sandy path with deep ruts from frequent vehicle use winds its way through the dunes. A single car drives along this path, kicking up a significant plume of light-colored dust as it navigates a bend.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot from a high, top-down angle, showing a car in the upper-center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a road that curves through a vast landscape of sand dunes. As the car drives along the road, kicking up a dust plume that trails behind it, the camera moves closer, transitioning to a wide shot. The camera then follows the car as it proceeds down a straight section of the road, keeping it centered in the frame as it travels from the top of the screen towards the bottom.",
