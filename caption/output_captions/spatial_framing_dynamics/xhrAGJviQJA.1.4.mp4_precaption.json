    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a fixed point of view from underneath a skateboard. The primary subject is the underside of the skateboard deck, which is decorated with a worn graphic in blue, black, yellow, and white. Attached to the deck are the trucks, with two off-white wheels visible. Mounted centrally between the trucks is a small, black, cube-shaped action camera. This camera is positioned with its lens facing the camera that is recording this video, and a small, illuminated blue light is visible on its front.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted underneath a skateboard captures the view between two off-white front wheels as it speeds along a curved path. The worn, blue underside of the skateboard deck, featuring some yellow and white graphics, occupies the top of the view. The camera travels rapidly across the smooth, light-brown surface of an outdoor skate ramp, causing the ground to appear as a motion-blurred streak. In the background, the ramp's edge curves upward against a bright, overexposed white sky, with the top of a green tree visible in the distance, suggesting a daytime setting.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is locked onto the underside of a moving skateboard in a skatepark, showing the wheels and the board\u2019s bottom surface. Another camera is also mounted on the opposite side of the skateboard\u2019s underside, shown at the center of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The shot is a fixed point-of-view from underneath a moving skateboard, with the board's underside occupying the top of the frame in the immediate foreground. A small action camera is mounted in the center of the frame, also in the foreground, positioned between two wheels that are visible at the bottom left and bottom right. The light-brown surface of a skate ramp fills the bottom half of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the middle ground. As the skateboard moves forward, the ramp's surface rushes towards the camera, creating a motion-blurred effect. In the background, the ramp curves upward against an overexposed white sky, with the top of a green tree briefly visible in the top right. The foreground elements remain static within the frame, contrasting with the rapid movement of the background.",
