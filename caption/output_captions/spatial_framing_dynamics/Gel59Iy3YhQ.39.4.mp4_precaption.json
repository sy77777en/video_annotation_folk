    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, pixelated, anthropomorphic bird-like character runs on a sandy shore and later starts to fly. This character has big black-and-white eyes, wears a red top and a brown, wide-brimmed hat. Nearby on the shore stands a red, arrow-shaped sign. In the lower-left corner, a row of six golden feather icons is displayed as an overlay.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, a pixelated character runs along the coast of a sunny island. The island features a yellow sandy beach with an orange-brown dirt path. At a higher elevation, there is a green, forested area with triangular trees. The island is surrounded by blue water with stylized white wave patterns, which becomes a lighter, translucent turquoise near the shore. The character runs along the path and then flies into the sky over the water near a red arrow signal on the sand. Overlay elements are visible on the screen, including a row of six golden feather icons in the bottom-left corner and a compass icon in the top-right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot, filmed from a high angle above the subject, initially frames a small, bird-like character in the lower center of the screen, positioned in the middle ground on a sandy island. The island, featuring a dirt path and a forested area in the background at the top, occupies the center and right of the frame, surrounded by the ocean in the foreground and on the left. A row of six feather icons is overlaid in the bottom-left corner, and a compass is in the top-right. The character runs down the path toward the bottom of the frame before turning and moving toward a red sign on the left edge of the island. The camera pans to follow as the character flies off the island, moving from the center-left over the water toward the left side of the frame.",
