    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, blue hair and a man are lying on their backs on a cracked, icy surface. The woman, positioned to the right, wears a long, quilted, light brown coat, dark bottoms, light-colored, fur-lined boots, and teal gloves. The man, to her left, is dressed in a dark beanie, a dark coat, dark pants, and dark shoes. Both appear to be looking upwards, with the woman's head resting near the man's shoulder.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is an overhead shot of two figures lying on a large, flat expanse of cracked ice. The ice surface is a muted, cool gray-blue, with prominent white cracks radiating outwards from a central point near the woman's right foot. The overall lighting is dim and diffuse, suggesting either an overcast day or twilight. The figures are positioned close together, angled slightly on the ice.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a woman and a man lying on a cracked icy surface. The pair is located in the center of the frame, with the woman positioned to the left and the man to her right. Both subjects are in the foreground, resting on the expansive ice, which features prominent cracks radiating from a point near the woman's right foot. The camera maintains a static, overhead position directly above the subjects, resulting in no changes to shot size or their position within the frame throughout the clip.",
