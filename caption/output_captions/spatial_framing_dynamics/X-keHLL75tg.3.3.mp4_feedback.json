    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot focused on a pair of black boots in the upper center of the frame, walking on a textured concrete floor that occupies the foreground. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning to a medium close-up that reveals a woman in equestrian attire positioned in the right middle ground and the head of a white horse in the left middle ground. A reddish-brown wooden stall is visible in the background on the left. Throughout the final shot, the camera remains stationary and positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman dressed in equestrian attire stands beside a white horse. She is wearing tall black riding boots with brown shin guards, white breeches, a dark navy riding jacket, black gloves, and a black helmet with a gold-colored trim. Her brown hair is tied back in a low bun. The woman is gently stroking the horse's neck behind its left ear with her right hand, while holding a blue rope tied to the horse's bridle with her left hand. The white horse is wearing a brown leather bridle with gold-colored metal hardware and stands calmly as the woman interacts with it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Within a stable, a person in equestrian attire, including tall black boots, white pants, and a black jacket, stands on a light-colored, textured concrete floor. They are positioned next to a white horse wearing a brown leather bridle with gold-colored hardware, to which a blue rope is attached. The person, also wearing a black helmet and gloves, gently strokes the horse's head while holding the blue rope. A reddish-brown wooden stall is visible in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
