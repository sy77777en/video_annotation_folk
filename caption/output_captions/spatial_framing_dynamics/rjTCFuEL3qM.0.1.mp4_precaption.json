    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features an abstract animation set against a dark, deep-blue background. A bright, glowing light source is positioned at the top center, towards which countless small, sparkling blue particles and thin, vertical streaks of light ascend. The particles, resembling a dense starfield, twinkle as they drift upwards, while the longer, more defined streaks of light rise in parallel lines, creating a visual effect akin to a celestial or digital ascent.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a dark, deep blue background, a bright cyan glow radiates from the top center of the scene. Numerous thin, vertical streaks of blue light and a cascade of small, sparkling particles continuously ascend towards this light source. The particles glitter as they move upwards, creating a visual effect of a gentle, constant light shower converging towards the bright center across the dark expanse.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene is composed of a static, straight-on shot against a dark blue background. A bright, cyan light source is fixed at the top center of the frame. From the bottom of the frame, numerous thin, vertical streaks of light and a dense field of small, sparkling particles continuously ascend towards this light source. The streaks of light are positioned in the middle ground, moving upwards in parallel lines. The sparkling particles are scattered across the foreground, middle ground, and background, creating a sense of depth as they drift upwards and twinkle throughout their ascent.",
