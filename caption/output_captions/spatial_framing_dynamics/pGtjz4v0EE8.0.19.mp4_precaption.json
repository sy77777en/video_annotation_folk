    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a high-angle, top-down perspective, a group of people are seated at an outdoor restaurant patio at night. The patrons, consisting of men and women, are gathered in small groups around numerous square tables arranged in rows. They are dressed in casual attire of various colors, including individuals in red, blue, and pink shirts. The tables are illuminated by small, glowing lamps and are set with white plates containing food and glasses. The people are actively eating and socializing with one another.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, top-down perspective, the scene captures an outdoor dining area at night. The restaurant's patio is a raised wooden deck, set upon a street paved with large, gray stone blocks. Square tables with light-colored tops are arranged in a grid, each illuminated by a small, downward-facing light that casts a warm, yellow glow. People are seated in dark chairs around the tables, eating and conversing. The camera slowly pulls back, revealing more of the surrounding stone pavement.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot begins from a high-angle, top-down perspective, with a group of people dining at an outdoor restaurant patio occupying the entire frame. The diners and their tables, arranged in a grid, are positioned in the middle ground. As the video progresses, the camera slowly pulls back, revealing the surrounding gray stone pavement in the background at the top, bottom, and left edges of the frame. This movement causes the patio and the group of diners to transition from filling the screen to being more centrally located, though they remain the dominant element.",
