    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, dense crowd of people is gathered in an urban setting at night. The crowd is composed of numerous men and women, mostly seen from behind, wearing a variety of casual, cool-weather clothing. Notable individuals include a person in a bright blue hoodie, another in a white hooded sweatshirt, and several others in dark jackets and hoodies. Many people in the crowd are holding up their smartphones, with the screens illuminated, as if they are recording or taking pictures of an event in front of them. The individuals are standing close together, filling the foreground and midground of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A large crowd fills a street at night in London's Piccadilly Circus. Ornate, multi-story stone buildings with classical facades line both sides of the street, illuminated by warm, golden light against the dark sky. On the left, a sign for the Piccadilly Theatre is visible. Further down the street, the iconic red and blue circular sign for the London Underground stands out among other glowing advertisements. The street is densely packed with people, creating a mass of figures under the bright glow of architectural lighting and commercial signs, with a slow, subtle movement rippling through the crowd.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static, wide, high-angle shot where a large crowd of people fills the entire bottom half of the frame, extending from the immediate foreground into the middle ground. In the middle ground, an ornate, illuminated building occupies the upper-left and center-left portions of the frame, while another building lines the upper-right. A street recedes between the buildings from the center of the frame into the background, where a London Underground sign is visible in the center-middle ground. The crowd is not stationary; there is a constant, subtle, collective movement as individuals shift, turn, and slowly move within the dense gathering.",
