    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with a dark complexion and a lean, muscular build is captured from a low-angle perspective with the camera fixed on the surfboard. He is shirtless and barefoot, wearing dark-colored board shorts with two red stripes on the side. His dark, wet hair, possibly styled in dreadlocks, moves with his motion. He maintains a low, athletic crouch on the surfboard, extending his arms to the sides for balance. A simple bracelet is visible on his right wrist, and a blue watch is on his left wrist. Water splashes around his feet and body as he rides the wave.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A dynamic POV shot from a camera mounted on a surfboard captures the exhilarating experience of riding a wave on a bright, sunny day. Initially, the perspective is high, looking down from the nose of the board, before transitioning to a low angle, looking up. The board features pink and purple markings, and the surrounding ocean is a vibrant mix of turquoise water and churning white foam from the breaking wave. Above, a blue sky is dotted with white clouds, and the sun creates a bright, backlit silhouette. In the distance, across the vast expanse of water, other surfers appear as small figures. Water splashes and sprays across the lens as the board glides through the water.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "Initially, the scene is captured from a high-angle, tilted perspective, showing a medium shot of the surfer's lower body in the center-left foreground. The nose of the surfboard occupies the bottom foreground, while a breaking wave is on the left in the middle ground, and the open ocean with distant surfers is visible in the right background. The camera then rapidly pivots upwards, transitioning to an extreme low-angle full shot. In this final framing, the surfer is centered in the foreground, crouched over the camera and silhouetted against the bright sky that now fills the background. The surfboard remains at the bottom of the frame, as the wave and splashing water envelop the scene from the sides and foreground.",
