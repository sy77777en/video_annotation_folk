    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A damaged section of an airplane fuselage is depicted against a dark, gradient background. The piece is primarily white, with a red and a blue stripe running horizontally along its length. Near the top, a small Malaysian flag is visible, with another flag inside the fuselage. The fuselage is severely damaged, with the outer skin torn away in large, ragged sections, particularly in the upper middle section. This damage exposes the dark, skeletal framework of the plane's internal structure. The object is lit from above, highlighting its tattered form.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A damaged section of an airplane fuselage is suspended against a dark, featureless background. The white exterior is marked with red and blue stripes running horizontally, and a small Malaysian flag is visible near the front. The fuselage is severely damaged, with large, jagged sections of its skin torn away, revealing the dark, skeletal frame of the aircraft's interior structure. The entire piece is illuminated by a soft, focused light emanating from the right side of the image in the otherwise dark space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A full shot shows a damaged section of an airplane fuselage positioned in the center of the frame. The object is located in the middle ground against a dark background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the frame remains static throughout the shot.",
