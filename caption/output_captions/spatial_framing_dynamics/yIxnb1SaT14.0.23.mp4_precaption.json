    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is an architectural scenery shot, showcasing a grand, white, multi-domed basilica at night, viewed from a low angle looking up a wide stone staircase. The basilica is brilliantly illuminated, standing out against a dark, cloudy sky, with trees framing the scene on either side of the stairs. While numerous indistinct human figures are present on the staircase and in front of the building, they are small in scale, serving to emphasize the structure's immensity rather than acting as a central subject. The focus is thus on the majestic architecture and the nocturnal atmosphere, highlighting the environment and scale over any specific entity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This time-lapse video, shot at night, features the illuminated Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica in Paris. The grand, white stone basilica, with its prominent central dome and smaller flanking domes and towers, stands majestically against a dark, cloudy sky. Wide stone steps lead up to the basilica's arched entrances, where figures of people ascend and descend, indicating movement over time. Trees frame the basilica on either side, some catching the ambient light. A bright light source on the right creates a starburst effect. The clouds in the sky also show movement, characteristic of a time-lapse. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANI\u0106 CINEMATOGRAPHER\" in white.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of architectural scenery, where the focus is on the environment and scale, with indistinct human figures present but not as central subjects. The grand, illuminated basilica is the central element, positioned in the middle ground to background, viewed from a low angle. A wide stone staircase occupies the bottom of the frame, extending upwards towards the center, situated in the foreground and leading into the middle ground. Trees frame the scene on the left and right sides, positioned in the foreground and middle ground. The dark, cloudy sky fills the top portion of the frame in the background, with clouds showing movement. Small human figures are visible on the staircase in the foreground and middle ground, moving up and down. A bright light source is present on the right side in the middle ground. A text overlay is consistently positioned in the bottom right corner of the frame, in the foreground. The camera remains static, maintaining a constant framing of the basilica and stairs, while the dynamic aspect comes from the movement of the clouds and the blurred motion of people.",
