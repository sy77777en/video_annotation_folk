    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a cityscape scenery from the perspective of a vehicle driving down a city street at night. The focus is on the overall environment and the atmosphere of the nocturnal drive, rather than on any specific object. The camera moves through an intersection, navigating between two rows of parked vehicles on either side of the street, under the glow of streetlights, creating a sense of place and experience. The scene is defined by the dark surroundings, the reflections on the car's hood, and the painted \"STOP\" marking on the asphalt, all contributing to the ambient urban setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures a drive down a dark city street at night. The paved, two-lane road is illuminated by the glow of overhead streetlights, with cars parked along both curbs. As the vehicle approaches an intersection marked with white lines and the word 'STOP' painted in large letters on the asphalt, it comes to a stop. Buildings with scattered lit windows are visible on either side of the street.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a city street at night, captured from a low-angle, forward-facing perspective from inside a moving vehicle. The hood of the car is visible at the bottom of the frame in the foreground. The road, with a central white lane divider, extends from the foreground into the background. In the middle ground, parked cars line both the left and right sides of the street, with dark buildings behind them. As the camera moves forward, the parked cars scroll past the frame. A large \"STOP\" marking painted on the road surface moves from the middle ground to fill the foreground before the camera proceeds through the intersection. Streetlights are positioned in the middle ground and background, illuminating the scene.",
