    "pre_caption": "This medium close-up shot is framed through the wooden lattice wall of a yurt, which occupies the entire foreground. Initially, a woman is positioned in the center of the middle ground, her hands working in the upper center of the frame. To the left in the middle ground, a horse is visible, while another person stands in the middle ground on the right. The background is filled with a green valley and snow-capped mountains. As the camera pans slightly to the right, the central woman remains in the middle of the frame, but the horse on the left and the person on the right move out of view. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned woman is partially visible behind a wooden lattice structure, which appears to be the wall of a yurt. She wears a white patterned head covering and a pink top. Her arms and hands are actively engaged in tying a wooden stick to a wooden shelf using a pink rope around the joints of the light-colored wooden slats. The lattice wall itself is decorated with a horizontal, woven band featuring a red, green, and white geometric pattern. On her right, there is another woman wearing a dark headscarf with white patterns. She is dressed in a light-colored sweatshirt with green sleeves and a green hat. As the camera moves to the right, she disappears from view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors in a wide, green valley during the daytime, with large, snow-capped mountains visible in the background under a bright sky. In the foreground, a light-colored wooden lattice wall, characteristic of a yurt, is being assembled. The crisscrossing wooden poles are secured with various ties, including natural-fiber ropes, bright pink cords, and a decorative woven band with a red and green geometric pattern that runs horizontally. In the middle ground, people can be seen actively working on the structure, and in the distance, a horse grazes in the expansive meadow.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video maintains a medium close-up shot of a woman tying the fence. The fence is positioned in front of her, partially blocking her face, shoulders, and arms, so they are not always fully visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
