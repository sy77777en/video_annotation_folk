    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a pair of hands in primarily black gloves with red accents are visible. The left hand holds an orange, rectangular device with a large, orange, hook-shaped antenna; the device's screen displays yellow signals and a portrait of a man with dark hair and sunglasses. The right hand is shown making a middle finger gesture and mimicking a shooting gesture. Initially, in the center of the scene, a white, spherical entity labeled \"CYBEHOLDER\" floats while enveloped in a crackling purple energy field, which dissipates later in the video. The entity occasionally moves to the center-left of the scene and features a circular opening capable of emitting red lasers. In the background, several large screens display various images: three show an anime-style woman with long dark hair in a kimono, another shows a stylized man with a large black afro and a distorted face, and a fifth displays a gun and Japanese text. Game interface elements, including a \"BATTERY LIFE\" bar and a \"RELOAD\" prompt, are also present.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, is set within a dark, circular arena with red glowing accents. The back wall is dominated by a large, curved bank of screens, three of which display an anime-style woman in a kimono, alongside a robotic-looking man with an afro and a graphic of a gun with Japanese text. Near the center of the arena, a spherical, mechanical object glows with purple energy as it hovers above the floor. The character's left hand holds an orange device displaying \"90% LIFE,\" while the gloved right hand gestures and poses as if shooting, creating a small flash of light at the fingertip. Overlay elements include a \"BATTERY LIFE\" bar and the word \"CYBEHOLDER\" at the upper-center of the screen, with a momentary \"RELOAD\" prompt appearing slightly below the center later on.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a pair of hands occupies the foreground, with the left hand holding a device at the bottom-left and the right hand gesturing at the bottom-right. In the middle ground, a spherical entity initially floats in the center of the frame, enveloped in purple energy, with a large, curved bank of screens positioned in the background behind it. The right hand changes from a raised middle finger to a pointing gesture, and a small white flash appears slightly below the center of the frame, followed by a \"RELOAD\" prompt in the same location. Concurrently, the purple energy around the spherical entity dissipates, and the entity itself moves from the center to a position in the center-left of the frame, where it remains for the rest of the clip. The hands in the foreground and the screens in the background remain in their fixed positions throughout the shot.",
