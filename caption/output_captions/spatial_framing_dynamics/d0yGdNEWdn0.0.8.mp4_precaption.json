    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged man with short dark brown hair that is thinning on top, and a full, short, dark brown beard and mustache with some gray, stands and speaks. He is wearing a light blue, long-sleeved, button-up collared shirt. Around his neck is a red lanyard with a name badge. A thin black wire, likely for a microphone, is visible near his collar. He gestures with both hands as he talks, holding a small, dark clicker in his right hand. He is oriented slightly to his right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, likely a presentation room or lecture hall. A man stands in the foreground, with a prominent dark red wall section to the left in the background. Behind the lecturer, there is a light-colored wooden podium with a dark rectangular opening. To the right, a large, bright white projection screen occupies a significant portion of the view. The lighting appears to be artificial, illuminating the space evenly.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a man, oriented slightly to his right, who is centrally positioned in the foreground. In the background on the left, a dark red wall section is visible. A light-colored wooden podium is in the middle ground, behind and to the left of the man. A large white projection screen occupies the right side of the background. The man actively gestures as he speaks: his right hand initially moves expansively up and to the right; then, both hands come towards his chest. Throughout the clip, he continues to use both hands dynamically in front of his body, with his left hand also making outward and upward gestures to the left. The camera remains at the subject's level.",
