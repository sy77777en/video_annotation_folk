    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged man with light skin, short dark brown hair that is thinning on top, and a full, short, dark brown beard and mustache with some gray, stands and speaks. He is wearing a light blue, long-sleeved, button-up collared shirt. Around his neck is a red lanyard with a name badge. A thin black wire, likely for a microphone, is visible near his collar. He gestures with both hands as he talks, holding a clicker in his right hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, likely a presentation room or lecture hall. A man stands in the foreground, but the background features a prominent dark red wall section to the left. Adjacent to this, a light-colored wooden cabinet or lectern with a dark rectangular opening is visible. To the right, a large, bright white projection screen occupies a significant portion of the view. The lighting appears to be artificial, illuminating the space evenly.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a man positioned in the center foreground. In the background, a dark red wall section is visible on the left, with a light-colored wooden cabinet to its immediate right, still within the left half of the frame. A large white projection screen occupies the right background. The man, holding a clicker in his right hand, gestures actively with both hands. His right hand initially moves up and towards the right side of the frame. Throughout the clip, both hands make a series of gestures, primarily in front of his chest, with movements extending outwards and upwards from his body. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level.",
