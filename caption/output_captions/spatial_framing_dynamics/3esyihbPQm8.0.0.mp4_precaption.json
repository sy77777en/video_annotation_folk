    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with a light-colored goatee is shown in mid-air from a close-up, first-person perspective. He is wearing a white helmet with an orange \"numa\" logo, black windproof glasses, and a black and yellow wingsuit with white panels on the underside of the wings. A black harness with blue straps is fastened across his chest, and a black and white patterned scarf is visible around his neck. His mouth is open, and his face shows an expression of intense concentration.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot mounted on a helmet, the perspective looks down past a person in a wingsuit as they fly extremely close to a steep, grey rock face. The rugged mountain terrain, composed of layered, craggy rock, rushes upward toward the camera under a flat, overcast white sky. The person is wearing a white helmet, dark sunglasses, and a black and yellow wingsuit with a blue harness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A man in a wingsuit is captured in a full shot, occupying the center-foreground of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, angled downwards from a first-person perspective. Below him, a steep, rocky mountain face fills the bottom half of the frame in the middle ground, while an overcast sky is visible in the top background. The man remains relatively static in his central position as the rocky terrain rushes upward toward the camera, creating a dynamic sense of rapid forward and downward movement.",
