    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video shows a close-up, side-profile view from behind a young man with fair skin and dark, wavy hair. He is wearing a dark-colored shirt. His gaze is directed downwards and towards the front, with his profile visible against a hazy, out-of-focus background. A strong backlight creates a bright outline around his hair, and a prominent green lens flare is visible over his head and shoulder.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Outdoors at dusk, a vast, open plain stretches toward a distant, hazy mountain range under a purple-hued sky. A young man with dark hair is seen from behind and in profile, his head illuminated by a strong backlight that creates a prominent green lens flare. The camera slowly moves, subtly shifting the perspective on the subject against the soft-focus, expansive landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium close-up shot frames a young man from behind and in profile, positioned in the center of the frame. He occupies the foreground, facing towards the right, with a prominent green lens flare visible over his head and shoulder in the center-left. In the background, a vast, out-of-focus plain stretches towards a distant mountain range. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly moves to the left, causing the man's profile to gradually shift towards the right side of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
