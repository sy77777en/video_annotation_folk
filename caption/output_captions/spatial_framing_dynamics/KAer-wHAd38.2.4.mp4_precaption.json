    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a serene rural environment, focusing on an expansive sky filled with fluffy, scattered clouds that create a dynamic and ever-changing atmosphere. The road stretches into the distance, flanked by lush green fields and occasional trees, emphasizing the vastness and tranquility of the countryside. In the distance along the road and to the right of the fields, there are some rural houses, with rolling hills further beyond. At the far end of the road, a person is riding an electric scooter towards the camera, adding a touch of life to the scene. Power lines run parallel to the road, adding a sense of scale and perspective. The absence of a specific main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the harmonious blend of natural and man-made elements, highlighting the peaceful coexistence of human infrastructure and the natural landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a serene rural landscape under a bright, clear sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. It is set outdoors during the day, featuring a narrow concrete road that winds through lush green fields. The road is flanked by evenly spaced utility poles, adding a sense of structure to the natural setting. In the distance on the right side of the road, several rural buildings are scattered across the fields, enhancing the charm of the scene. Beyond them, gentle hills rise against the horizon, providing a picturesque backdrop. The vibrant green of the fields contrasts with the deep blue of the sky, creating a vivid and tranquil scene. The environment is calm, with no visible movement, emphasizing the peacefulness of the countryside.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a rural landscape, with the camera positioned at the height of the road. The concrete road runs from the bottom center of the frame into the middle ground, leading towards the horizon in the background. On either side of the road, lush green fields extend to the left and right, occupying the foreground and middle ground. Utility poles are evenly spaced along the road, starting from the bottom left and right, stretching into the distance, and providing a sense of depth and perspective. The expansive sky, filled with scattered clouds, dominates the top half of the frame, creating a dynamic backdrop. In the background, rural houses are visible on the right side, with rolling hills further beyond, adding layers to the scene. The power lines run parallel to the road, enhancing the sense of scale and leading the viewer's eye through the composition.",
