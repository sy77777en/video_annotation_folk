    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features a dramatic landscape scenery shot that reveals a peculiar, sprawling house from behind a screen of tangled branches. The cobbled-together structure, complete with a rickety-looking tower and a large sphero-cylinder tank on its roof, is perched precariously on a cliff edge overlooking a dense pine forest. In the distance, layers of mountains fade into a misty, golden-hued sky at either dawn or dusk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a camera rises from behind dense, leafy bushes to reveal a large, unconventional house perched on a cliff edge at either sunset or sunrise. The structure, overlooking a forest of dark pine trees, is a composite of different elements, including a tall, rickety-looking tower and a sphero-cylinder water tank on the roof. In the background, layers of mountains fade into a misty valley under a cloudy, golden-orange sky. Gnarled, brown branches fill the foreground, and birds can be seen flying in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the scenery. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot. It begins with a close-up of tangled, leafy branches that fill the frame. The camera then rises and pulls back, transitioning to an extreme wide shot that reveals a vast landscape. In the final composition, the branches occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A large, unconventional house on a cliff edge is positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right of the center, surrounded by a forest. The background is composed of layers of mountains stretching across the frame, with a cloudy, golden sky at the top. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking out over the scene.",
