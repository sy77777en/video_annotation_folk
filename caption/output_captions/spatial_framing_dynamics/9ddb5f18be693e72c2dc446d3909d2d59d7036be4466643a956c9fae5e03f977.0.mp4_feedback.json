    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot from a low, foot-level angle, focusing on a person's lower legs and feet, which are positioned in the center middle ground on a patch of grass. A yellow golf ball rolls into the frame from the bottom left and settles in the foreground, left of center. Following this, a silver golf club head enters from the top left and moves down, positioning itself in the foreground just behind the ball. The person's feet remain stationary throughout the shot, while a portion of a golf bag is partially visible in the top left background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, seen from ground level with a straight angle, showing their lower legs and feet, standing on a patch of green grass. They are wearing light-colored, loose-fitting trousers and dark blue suede sneakers with a white stripe on the side, white laces, and a brown gum sole. The silver golf club and the yellow golf ball enter from the left. The silver-colored iron golf club positions the yellow golf ball in front of the person's feet, then positions itself behind the ball, poised to be swung.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a ground-level perspective on a manicured green lawn, a person stands wearing light-colored trousers and dark blue suede sneakers with white laces and a brown gum sole. In the middle ground, the person's feet are positioned standing. A yellow golf ball rests on the grass in the foreground, with the head of a silver metal golf club positioned to the left and behind it. The background is softly blurred, showing trees and foliage under daylight conditions. To the top left, a portion of a red and black object, consistent with a golf bag, is partially visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
