    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of an informational display, which fills most of the frame and is positioned centrally in both the 2D frame and the middle ground of the scene, with the camera at the same height as the display. The camera then pans smoothly to the right, shifting the display out of the frame and revealing additional exhibit elements and a wooden hallway, which appear on the right and center of the frame in the middle ground. The scene then transitions outdoors to a wide view of an elephant enclosure, where the camera is positioned at the height of the viewing walkway, looking across the enclosure. In this shot, tall cylindrical columns are distributed across the middle and background, occupying the left, center, and right portions of the frame. An adult elephant is partially visible behind the columns in the left middle ground, while other elephants are seen walking in the middle ground and background, moving from left to right. The enclosure\u2019s fencing and rocks are in the foreground, spanning the bottom of the frame, while sparse greenery and trees are visible in the background, mostly at the top and right. Throughout the video, the main subjects (the display and elephants) disappear from the frame as the camera pans or transitions, and the camera remains at the subjects\u2019 height before they exit the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up of an informational display featuring a timeline and photographs of several elephants, each labeled with names and dates, and accompanied by Japanese and English text describing the introduction of elephants at the Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens. The display includes images of elephants of varying sizes and ages, with some shown individually and others in small groups, and uses icons and lines to indicate their presence over time. The camera then pans right from the close-up of the monitor to other elephant displays, display windows, and a wooden hallway. The scene shifts to an outdoor zoo enclosure with multiple tall, cylindrical columns and a fenced area. Within the enclosure, an adult elephant with gray, wrinkled skin and visible tusks stands partially obscured behind the columns. Several elephants are seen walking slowly in the enclosure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, begins indoors at the Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens, where a large, glossy informational display is mounted on a wall. The display features a green and white color scheme with Japanese and English text, a timeline, elephant icons, and photographs of elephants, all protected by a reflective surface. The camera smoothly pans to the right, moving from a close-up of the informational display to reveal additional elephant exhibits, display windows, and a wooden hallway. The video then transitions outdoors to a covered walkway overlooking an elephant enclosure. The setting is open-air, with a view of sandy ground, large rocks, and multiple tall, cylindrical columns in a pale orange color supporting the structure. The enclosure is bordered by metal railings and fencing, with sparse greenery and a few trees visible in the background under a cloudy sky. The overall environment is clean and well-maintained, with the architecture blending concrete and natural elements.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
