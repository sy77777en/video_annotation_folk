    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a quiet urban street corner, focusing on the environment rather than a specific subject. The scene includes elements like a vending machine, bicycles, and residential buildings, emphasizing the everyday atmosphere of the neighborhood. The presence of a traffic light and a no-parking sign adds to the urban setting. The overall composition highlights the scale and layout of the street, creating a sense of place without focusing on any single object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, shows an outdoor street corner in a Japanese residential area, likely in the late afternoon or early evening. To the left, against a building with a light-brown, textured stone wall, stand two vending machines: one is red, and the other is white with a prominent \"100\u5186\" sign, both filled with beverages. Several bicycles, including a pink one, are parked neatly in a designated space next to the white vending machine and a utility pole. This pole holds a pedestrian crossing signal displaying a red standing figure and a circular blue-and-red \"No Parking\" sign. An asphalt road with white painted markings occupies the foreground and curves away between houses typical of Japanese residential architecture. A silver SUV is parked in a driveway further down the street. Overhead utility wires crisscross the view. The video includes a slight shift forward and to the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a street corner scene. In the left foreground, two vending machines stand against a stone-walled building. Adjacent to them, in the center-left foreground, several bicycles are parked next to a utility pole. This pole, positioned in the center foreground/middle ground, features a pedestrian traffic light above a no-parking sign. The street occupies the bottom foreground, curving towards the right middle ground between residential houses. A silver SUV is visible parked in a driveway in the center-right middle ground. Houses line the street in the middle ground and background. The camera is positioned at approximately eye level. During the shot, the camera moves slightly forward and pans slightly to the right, subtly shifting the perspective and bringing the elements slightly closer while revealing a little more of the street curving to the right.",
