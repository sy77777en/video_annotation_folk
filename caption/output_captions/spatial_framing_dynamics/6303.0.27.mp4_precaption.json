    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a basketball court scene with a unique basketball as the main subject. The basketball, positioned prominently in the foreground, has a human face with expressive features, including eyes and a mouth, giving it a surreal appearance. In the background, several people are playing basketball. They are dressed in casual sportswear, with one person wearing a green jacket and white pants, and another in a blue top. The players are engaged in the game, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The court is surrounded by graffiti-covered walls, enhancing the urban setting. The focus remains on the animated basketball, which stands out due to its unusual and eye-catching design.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor basketball court during the day, surrounded by urban elements. The court's surface is a textured red material, and a basketball with a unique face design is prominently placed in the foreground. In the background, a group of people is engaged in a game, with their movements adding dynamic energy to the scene. The surrounding environment includes graffiti-covered walls and nearby buildings, indicating an urban setting. The sky is clear with a few clouds, suggesting fair weather. Trees with autumn foliage add a touch of natural color to the otherwise urban landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of an outdoor basketball court. The main subject, a basketball with a human face, is prominently positioned in the bottom center foreground. In the background, several people are playing basketball, with their positions varying slightly as they move. They are primarily located in the middle ground, with some players towards the top left and others towards the top right. The court is surrounded by graffiti-covered walls, which are in the background, adding to the urban setting. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a consistent view throughout the scene. The shot remains stable, with the basketball as the central focus, while the players' movements add dynamic elements to the background.",
