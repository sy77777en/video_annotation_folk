    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot, initially focusing on a man positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. Behind him, in the background, another out-of-focus figure is visible. The camera then pans slightly to the left, revealing more individuals in the background. One man appears towards the left edge, and another towards the right edge, both situated in the middle ground to background. During this pan, the main subject shifts slightly towards the left side of the frame while remaining the central focus. The background figures are seen moving subtly. The camera is positioned level with the main subject's height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium build and a mustache, who appears to be the main subject. He has a focused expression and is wearing a dark outfit, which might be perceived as black. His long black hair is neatly combed back. In the background, there are several men, some dressed in light gray robes and others in yellow robes with black trim. These secondary subjects are less prominent and appear to be observing the main subject, adding context to the scene. The main subject's posture and attire suggest a setting of significance or formality.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors, featuring a dimly lit room with stone walls, creating a somber atmosphere. The environment is characterized by muted colors, primarily grays, with a shallow focus that emphasizes the man in the middle ground. The lighting is soft, casting subtle shadows that enhance the room's depth. One main individual is centrally positioned, wearing very dark traditional attire. Several other individuals are in the background, dressed in traditional attire in either gray or yellow, and they are moving. The scene is dynamic, with the camera following the main subject as he moves, and the background changing slightly.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
