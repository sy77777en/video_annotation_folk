    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two individuals, an older man and a boy, engaged in a close interaction. The man, with gray hair and a lined face, wears a dark green sweater over a collared shirt. He initially has his head lowered before lifting it to look at the boy, maintaining a contemplative expression without smiling. The boy, with short dark hair, is seen from the back and slightly to the left, wearing a white shirt with a dark collar. Their proximity suggests a conversation or moment of connection, with the man looking at the boy attentively.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting with an over-the-shoulder point of view, focusing on a room with warm lighting. The environment is intimate, featuring a neutral-colored wall and a framed picture in the background. The scene includes two subjects, with one facing away from the camera, allowing a view of their upper body and the room ahead. The subjects are engaged in a moment of interaction, adding a sense of personal connection to the setting. The overall atmosphere is calm and focused, with no significant movement or changes in the environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of two individuals, capturing their upper bodies and faces. The older man is positioned on the left side of the frame, occupying the foreground, while the boy is on the right, slightly further back in the middle ground. The man's initial position has his head lowered, then he lifts it to face the boy, maintaining eye contact throughout. The boy, seen from behind and slightly to the left, remains stationary. Both are centered horizontally within the frame. The background consists of a neutral-colored wall with a framed picture located in the top left corner, providing depth to the scene. The camera maintains a steady position at the subjects' eye level, emphasizing their interaction without any noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning.",
