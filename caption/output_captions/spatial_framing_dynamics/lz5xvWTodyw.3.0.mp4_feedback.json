    "pre_caption": "This wide scenery shot is captured from a high-angle, third-person perspective, positioned just behind and above a green vehicle. The vehicle occupies the bottom center foreground, moving forward along an elevated highway that extends from the bottom of the frame into the distant background, creating a sense of depth. Buildings are positioned in the middle ground on the left, while a body of water and distant city elements are visible in the background on the right. Several static overlays frame the scene: \"Pier 59\" is in the top right corner, a mini-map is in the bottom left, a \"JUMP\" meter is in the bottom right, and a \"Passengers\" bar is at the bottom center. A large white arrow is located in the upper center, pointing down toward the road ahead. As the camera moves forward with the vehicle, the surrounding scenery flows from the background toward the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a cityscape from a third-person video game perspective, where the viewer seems to control a green train navigating through the urban environment. Approximately one and a half cars of the green train are visible, adding a dynamic and interactive element to the scene, which highlights the scale and atmosphere of the city, including its buildings, roads, and surrounding areas.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an urban setting on a cloudy day, showcasing a highway elevated above a cityscape. Modern buildings with illuminated windows line the road, highlighting an active city environment. The highway is bordered by streetlights, with a park featuring sparse trees adjacent to it. A body of water is visible to the right of the highway. The road is smooth and wide, accommodating a large, green vehicle in motion, emphasizing the scene's dynamic nature. Overlays include a white arrow in the upper center of the screen, changing direction with the green train's movement. The top and bottom corners display text, with \"Pier 59\" in the upper right corner. The lower right corner shows game information with \"JUMP 100%,\" while the lower left corner features a game mini-map. The bottom overlay displays changing numbers with \"Passengers\" and a green and gray status bar.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
