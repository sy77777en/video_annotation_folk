    "pre_caption": "This scenery video opens with a low-angle wide shot, capturing the corner of a multi-story brick building that fills the frame from the bottom edge upwards. The building is positioned in the foreground and middle ground, with its corner running diagonally from the bottom center towards the top right. A portion of the clear sky is visible in the background at the top of the frame. The camera then performs a slow, continuous zoom-in, transitioning towards a medium shot focused on the upper floors of the building's right-facing facade. This movement brings the architectural details into closer view, with the final frame centered on a section of windows. The low-angle perspective is maintained throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, offering a low-angle, upward-looking view of the corner of a large, multi-story brick building against a clear, pale blue sky. The structure features classic architectural details, including intricate brickwork, numerous windows arranged in a grid, and a row of arched windows along the top floor beneath a dark cornice. There is no main subject, as the camera's slow zoom-in is designed to emphasize the building's imposing scale and textural details. The focus remains on the architectural environment, creating an atmospheric and observational perspective rather than following a specific character or action.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An upward-looking shot captures the corner of a multi-story, red-brown brick building against a clear, pale blue-green sky. The building features classic architecture with large, rectangular windows set in vertical bays and a row of arched windows along the top floor, just below a dark cornice. The view slowly zooms in on the upper floors, eventually revealing a potted plant inside one of the windows.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
