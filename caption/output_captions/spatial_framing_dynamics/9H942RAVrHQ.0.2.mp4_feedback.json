    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an animated anthropomorphic fox in a minimalistic indoor setting with a grid-patterned floor and a plain background. The fox occupies the center of the frame throughout the video, moving dynamically across the space. Initially, the fox is positioned near the bottom center, interacting with a bamboo dragonfly. As the video progresses, the fox leaps into the air, reaching the upper center of the frame while maintaining its interaction with the dragonfly. The fox then descends back towards the bottom center, continuing its playful movements. The camera remains at the subject's level, capturing the full range of motion without any noticeable changes in angle or perspective. The grid-patterned floor serves as the foreground, providing a consistent reference point for the fox's movements, while the plain background remains static, emphasizing the character's actions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an animated anthropomorphic fox with exaggerated, cartoon-like features. The fox has a large, bushy tail and elongated ears, and its body is drawn with fluid, dynamic lines. It is depicted in a playful pose, interacting with a bamboo dragonfly, which adds an interesting dynamic to the scene. The fox's limbs are extended. The character's design emphasizes agility and expressiveness.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an animated scene set in a minimalistic, indoor environment with a grid-patterned floor and a plain background. The setting is devoid of detailed features, focusing on a character's dynamic movement. The overall style is simplistic, with a monochromatic color scheme that highlights the character's movements against the stark backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
