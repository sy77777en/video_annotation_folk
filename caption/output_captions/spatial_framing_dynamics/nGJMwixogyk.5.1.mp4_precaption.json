    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is an architectural and streetscape scenery shot. It captures a traditional wooden structure with intricate details, such as a tiled roof and wooden beams, highlighting cultural architecture. The surrounding environment includes a quiet street lined with trees and bushes, and traditional buildings with wooden facades. The focus is on the harmonious blend of architecture and nature, emphasizing the atmosphere and setting rather than a specific object. The overall scene conveys a sense of tranquility and cultural heritage.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, capturing an outdoor setting in a traditional Japanese neighborhood. The scene unfolds during the day, under clear blue skies, with sunlight casting distinct shadows. The environment features a wooden structure with a tiled roof, showcasing traditional Japanese architecture. The wooden beams are dark and weathered, adding a sense of history. A red wooden fence and lush green bushes frame the foreground, enhancing the natural ambiance. The street is lined with trees and small shrubs, leading to traditional wooden houses with sloped roofs. A narrow sidewalk runs alongside the road, bordered by a low hedge. The overall atmosphere is serene and picturesque, with a harmonious blend of natural and architectural elements.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot capturing a traditional Japanese street. Initially, a large wooden gate structure dominates the top and right of the frame, positioned in the foreground and middle ground, with a red fence in the bottom right foreground. On the left, a sidewalk and trees are visible. The camera then pans from right to left, shifting the wooden gate to the right side of the frame. This movement reveals a long, straight street lined with traditional buildings in the background, and a sidewalk bordered by green bushes that stretches from the left foreground into the middle ground. The camera is positioned at eye level, providing a first-person perspective of the scene.",
