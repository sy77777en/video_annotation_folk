    "pre_caption": "This scenery video is presented as a wide shot from a low-angle, forward-facing perspective, as if from inside a vehicle. The wet street occupies the bottom and center of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the background, with colorful reflections of lights visible in the foreground and middle ground. Buildings adorned with neon signs line the left and right sides of the frame in the middle ground. A prominent green sign for \"CHEERS\" is visible on the left, while another green sign for \"CLUB SUPERSTAR\" is on the right. Parked cars are positioned along the left side of the road in the middle ground. As the camera moves slowly forward, the buildings and signs on the periphery drift towards and past the edges of the frame, while the view down the center of the street remains the primary focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a drive through a bustling urban street at night. The scene is dominated by vibrant, glowing neon signs in various colors, including green, red, and yellow, which cast long, shimmering reflections on the wet, dark asphalt. Buildings line the street, their facades adorned with these luminous advertisements, while cars are parked along the road and visible in the distance. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is on creating a specific mood and capturing the immersive, rain-slicked, neon-drenched atmosphere of the city. The wide, slightly distorted perspective from what appears to be inside a vehicle enhances this focus on the environment rather than any single element within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures a slow drive through a city street at night. The pavement is wet from rain, creating slick, colorful reflections of the surrounding lights. The street is lined with buildings adorned with numerous bright neon signs in green, red, pink, and yellow, advertising various establishments in both English and Japanese script. Signs for \"CLUB SUPERSTAR\" and \"CHEERS\" are visible among the glowing advertisements. Other vehicles are parked along the road and moving in the distance, navigating the illuminated urban environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
