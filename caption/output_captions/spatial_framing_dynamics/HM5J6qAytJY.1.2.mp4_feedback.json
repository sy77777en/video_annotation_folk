    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a fixed medium shot from a camera mounted on the front left hood of a blue car, positioning the car's hood in the bottom left and center foreground. Through the windshield, two helmeted individuals are framed in the center middle ground. The road extends from the foreground to the middle ground on the right, with distant mountains visible in the background across the top of the frame. As the scene progresses, a second sports car enters the frame from the rear right, pulling alongside the blue car to become fully visible in the middle ground on the right side. The camera remains fixed at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a matte blue sports car, viewed from a camera mounted on its front hood looking back towards the windshield. Inside the car, two people are visible from the shoulders up, both wearing helmets. The person in the driver's seat wears a multicolored helmet with prominent yellow, blue, and red sections. The person in the passenger seat wears what appears to be a white helmet. A second sports car, which is silver or grey, appears on the right. This car is distinguished by a large black rear wing and has its headlights on.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from the side of a blue sports car captures a drive along a paved road in a vast, arid landscape at either sunrise or sunset. The camera's perspective remains fixed, showing the car's hood, windshield, and side mirror. Through the windshield, two people wearing helmets are visible. The clear sky transitions from deep blue to a warm orange glow at the horizon, silhouetting distant, hazy mountains. As the car moves forward, another silver sports car with a large rear wing appears on the right, driving parallel to it on the dark asphalt, which is marked with tire tracks.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a medium shot of the car. The camera is fixed at the front of the car, capturing two people inside, with only their heads visible. The car then overtakes another sports car, which is fully visible on the right.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
