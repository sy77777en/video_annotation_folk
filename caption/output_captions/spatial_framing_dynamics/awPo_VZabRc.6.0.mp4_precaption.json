    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of this animated video is a young woman with light skin and black hair styled in an updo, seen walking in profile from left to right. She wears a pink short-sleeved t-shirt, dark pants, and carries a light blue backpack over her right shoulder. To her right stands a woman with long blonde hair, wearing a light purple t-shirt and a white apron. In the foreground, seen from behind, is a man with reddish-brown hair wearing a brown jacket and a red baseball cap. An older man with a prominent nose, wearing a dark blue cap and a grey jacket, is also briefly visible in the foreground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The animated scene takes place inside a diner or cafe, characterized by a muted color scheme of browns and grays. In the background, a service counter is lined with red-topped stools. Above this counter, a reddish-brown valance or set of cabinets is marked with a repeating pattern of small, light-colored crosses. Booths with reddish-brown upholstered backs are positioned in the foreground and middle ground. The space is illuminated by simple, spherical white light fixtures hanging from the ceiling.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman with black hair is positioned in the middle ground, slightly left of center. In the foreground, the back of a man in a red cap occupies the bottom center, and another man briefly appears to his left before exiting the frame. The main subject walks from left to right, passing behind the man in the foreground and moving toward the right side of the frame. A blonde woman stands in the middle ground to the right. The scene is set in a diner with a counter in the background and booths in the foreground and middle ground. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' height.",
