    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a surreal and whimsical scene with two distinct subjects. The first subject is a seal-like creature with a smooth, rounded body and large, expressive eyes, swimming gracefully. Accompanying the seal are two groups of three penguins each, positioned on an ice block behind it. The penguins appear to be engaged in a dance, adding a lively and coordinated element to the scene. The second scene introduces three identical, cartoonish elephant-like creatures standing upright. These creatures have elongated trunks, large ears, and exaggerated, playful expressions. They are positioned side by side, each with a similar stance, suggesting a synchronized or coordinated action. The background is filled with stylized lotus flowers, adding to the fantastical atmosphere. The overall style is sketch-like, with a monochromatic color scheme.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a whimsical, monochromatic scene with a surreal, artistic style. The setting is outdoors, featuring a backdrop of stylized lotus flowers floating on water. The environment is calm and imaginative, with a focus on playful, cartoon-like creatures. In the first part, a seal-like creature is depicted with a textured, sketch-like appearance, swimming in the water. In the latter part, three elephant-like figures stand in a row, each with exaggerated features and a similar sketchy texture. Additionally, penguins are shown standing on ice blocks, adding to the imaginative landscape. The overall composition is characterized by its black-and-white color scheme and the creative, dreamlike quality of the characters and setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video showcases a surreal, sketch-like scene with dynamic spatial arrangements. Initially, a seal-like creature is positioned in the foreground, lying on its back with its head raised towards the top center of the frame. Behind it, in the middle ground, three penguins stand on ice blocks, arranged in a line across the center. The background is filled with rows of stylized lotus flowers, creating a repeating pattern that extends horizontally. As the video progresses, the seal-like creature remains in the foreground, now raising one arm upwards while the penguins continue their synchronized dance, maintaining their central position. The scene then shifts to introduce three identical, cartoonish elephant-like creatures in the foreground, standing side by side and occupying the lower center of the frame. Their trunks are raised, and they appear to be in a synchronized pose. The lotus flowers persist in the background, providing a consistent, stylized backdrop throughout the video. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subjects, capturing the whimsical interactions and movements within this imaginative setting.",
