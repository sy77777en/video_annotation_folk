    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a Parisian cityscape at night, focusing on the scenery. Initially, the illuminated Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay is positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, with the Seine River flowing through the center and lower portions. A tree-lined promenade occupies the foreground along the bottom left, while other bridges are visible in the background. The camera, positioned at a slightly elevated height, slowly pans from left to right, causing the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay to shift more towards the center-right. During this movement, a boat travels from right to left in the middle ground on the river. The sky fills the top of the frame, and a static text overlay is present in the bottom right corner throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video begins with a sweeping cityscape scenery shot of Paris at night from the left bank of the Seine River. The camera moves across the river, capturing the grand, illuminated facade of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay with its distinctive large clock, which dominates the right bank. Its warm yellow lights cast long, shimmering reflections on the dark, flowing water. Along the left bank, a tree-lined promenade is lit, while in the distance, other bridges and city lights twinkle under a deep blue, partly cloudy sky. The video concludes with the camera still positioned above the water, capturing the overall romantic atmosphere, architectural beauty, and vibrant nocturnal energy of the urban landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A nighttime view captures the Seine River in Paris, with the large, illuminated Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay prominent on the far bank. The historical building, distinguished by its arched windows and a large clock face, is lit with warm, yellow light, casting long, shimmering reflections across the dark surface of the river. Along the near bank, a walkway lined with bare trees is visible, though the details are not entirely clear. In the mid-ground, a bridge with arches spans the water, and a boat moves along the river. The deep blue night sky is filled with soft, moving clouds. A white text overlay in the bottom right corner reads \"MATHIEU STANI\u0106\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" underneath.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
