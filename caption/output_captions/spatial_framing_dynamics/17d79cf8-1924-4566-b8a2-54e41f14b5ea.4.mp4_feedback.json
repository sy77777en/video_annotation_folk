A bucket containing cement is positioned in the center left middle ground. Adjacent to the bucket, a partially constructed brick wall extends from the top left middle ground downwards. Several loose bricks are scattered in the center right middle ground. Concrete steps are visible in the top right middle ground, extending into the background. Greenery occupies the background, primarily on the left side below the wall. Initially, the subject's left hand holds a brick in the bottom left foreground.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is shot from a head-mounted camera perspective, featuring a person engaged in construction work. The individual, whose skin tone is medium, is wearing dark patterned pants , blue flip-flops and a light-colored shirt. They are holding bricks, one in each hand, with visible text imprinted on one of the bricks. The scene includes a partially constructed brick wall and a container with cement. The person appears to be standing on a concrete surface, possibly a staircase, with scattered bricks and construction materials around them. The setting suggests an outdoor environment with some greenery visible nearby. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of an outdoor construction setting. The scene features a partially built brick wall on a concrete surface, with scattered red bricks and a container of wet cement nearby. The environment includes a mix of natural and constructed elements, with greenery visible beyond the construction area. The time of day is likely midday, indicated by the bright lighting and shadows. The bricks are red with a rough texture, and the cement appears gray and wet. The setting suggests an active construction site with visible progress and materials in use.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
