    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, green-striped watermelon is shown in the process of exploding while resting on a brown cardboard box. The force of the explosion sends the red, pulpy flesh and juice spraying upwards and outwards in a fine mist. The dark green rind of the watermelon is shattered, with large, pointed sections peeling back like the petals of a flower, revealing the red interior.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting against a backdrop of blurred green foliage, a watermelon resting on a brown cardboard box explodes in slow motion. Red flesh and a fine mist of juice erupt from the center, while the dark green rind shatters into large, pointed pieces that are sent flying outwards. The central scene is framed by vertical bars on the left and right, which are blurred extensions of the main video content.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a watermelon on a cardboard box is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, set against a background of blurred green foliage. The central scene is flanked by blurred vertical bars on the left and right sides of the frame. As the watermelon explodes, its rind peels away from the center, while pieces of red flesh and mist are propelled upwards and outwards from this central point. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
