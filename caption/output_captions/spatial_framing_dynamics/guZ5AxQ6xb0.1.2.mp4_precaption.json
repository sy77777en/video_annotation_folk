    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two women are engaged in a judo throw. The woman being thrown wears a blue judo gi with a black belt and has a patch on her back that reads \"J. TUTASS\" and \"USA.\" Her hair is tied in a ponytail. The woman performing the throw wears a white judo gi with a black belt and also has her hair tied in a ponytail.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place indoors in a dimly lit gym or dojo, where two individuals are engaged in a martial arts practice. The environment is characterized by a spacious, open area with a smooth, light-colored mat covering the floor. The lighting is focused, casting shadows and highlighting the movement of the participants. One person wears a blue gi, while the other is in a white gi, both with visible patches and markings. The action involves dynamic grappling, with one participant executing a throw, capturing the fluid motion and physicality of the practice. The background is dark, emphasizing the figures and their movements against the subdued setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot, with two women centrally positioned in the middle ground against a dark background. A light-colored floor is visible at the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. One woman, in a white gi, initiates a throw on the other woman, who is in a blue gi. The woman in blue starts in an upright, lifted position and then rotates horizontally in the air, her legs extending towards the frame's left and her upper body towards the frame's right, while her overall position remains central. The woman in white acts as a stable pivot in the center middle ground throughout this dynamic movement. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
