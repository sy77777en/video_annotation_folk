    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a waterfront landscape scenery shot, capturing a wide expanse of choppy water under a hazy, overcast sky with the sun faintly visible through the clouds. The distant shoreline is lined with indistinct, silhouetted buildings, their outlines softened by the mist, while the foreground features stone steps and platforms partially submerged by gentle waves. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the environment, emphasizing the interplay between water, light, and distant architecture rather than highlighting any specific object or individual.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an outdoor waterfront scene during daytime with overcast skies and diffused sunlight partially obscured by mist or fog. The setting features a body of choppy water bordered by stone or concrete steps and platforms, some of which are wet and darkened by moisture, with visible patches of moss or algae along the waterline. In the distance, the silhouettes of low-rise buildings and a few taller structures are faintly visible through the haze, forming a subdued city skyline. The water moves steadily against the steps, creating small waves and white foam at the edges. The overall atmosphere is cool and damp, with no overlays or additional visual elements present.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture the waterfront scenery, with no main subject present. In the frame, stone steps and platforms occupy the bottom left and bottom right in the foreground, partially submerged by water. The choppy water extends across the center and middle ground, filling most of the frame horizontally. The distant shoreline with silhouetted buildings forms a continuous horizontal line in the background, stretching from the left to the right edge near the top of the frame. The overcast sky and faint sun occupy the upper portion of the frame in the background. The camera is positioned at a low height, close to the level of the steps and water, emphasizing the foreground elements. Between the two frames, the camera shifts slightly lower and more centrally, bringing the steps and waterline more prominently into the foreground while maintaining the wide view of the water and distant skyline.",
