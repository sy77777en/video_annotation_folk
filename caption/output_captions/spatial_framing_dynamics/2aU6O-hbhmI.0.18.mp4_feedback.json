    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from a high-angle perspective. A tall residential building dominates the foreground, positioned on the left side of the frame and extending from top to bottom. In the background, a sunset occupies the right horizon, with another high-rise under construction visible in the upper right. The camera performs a rapid downward and tilting motion, causing the foreground building to rush past. This movement shifts the focus, bringing the background and middle ground elements, such as a parking garage and construction materials at the bottom right, into greater prominence as the camera descends.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dynamic cityscape scenery shot captured from a fast-moving, downward-tilting perspective. The video follows a rapid descent alongside a modern, multi-story residential building with numerous glass balconies, set against a dramatic sunset sky filled with orange light on the horizon and dark clouds above. In the background, another high-rise is visible under construction, complete with a crane, while the ground level reveals a construction site and other illuminated urban structures. The wide, sweeping shot is intended to capture the overall atmosphere, scale, and energy of the urban environment rather than focusing on a specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a dynamic, fast-paced flight alongside a modern high-rise residential building in a city at sunset. The building's balconies appear curved due to a fisheye effect, with glass and metal railings reflecting the setting sun's orange glow. In the background, the sky is a mix of dark clouds and a bright orange and yellow glow on the horizon. Other urban structures are visible, including another high-rise under construction with a crane on its roof and a multi-level parking garage below.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
