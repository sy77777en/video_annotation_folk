    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape, with the environment serving as the central focus. Dark storm clouds occupy the top and center of the frame, extending down into the middle ground. Below, a glowing horizon line with silhouetted mountains is visible in the background. In the foreground, two parallel highways start at the bottom left and bottom right, converging toward the center as they stretch into the middle ground, creating a sense of depth. Sheets of rain and flashes of lightning periodically appear in the middle ground, descending from the clouds. As the scene progresses, long light trails from vehicles emerge on the left highway, moving from the bottom left foreground toward the center middle ground. The camera maintains a static, high-angle position, offering an elevated and expansive view of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, capturing a powerful thunderstorm over a vast, open highway at dusk or night. The composition intentionally lacks a single main subject, instead focusing on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural event, making the environment itself the central focus. Turbulent, dark purple storm clouds dominate the sky, from which sheets of rain descend and brilliant forks of lightning strike the ground, illuminating the entire scene in flashes of pink and white. Below the storm, the horizon glows with a warm orange and pink light, while the headlights of distant cars on the parallel highways create long, glowing light trails that stretch into the heart of the tempest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, a massive storm system with dark, turbulent purple clouds looms over a vast, arid landscape. In the distance, sheets of rain are illuminated by an orange and pink glow on the horizon. Bright flashes of lightning periodically light up the clouds and strike the ground. Below, two parallel asphalt highways stretch into the distance, and as the storm progresses, long, bright streaks of light from vehicle headlights appear on one of the roads, indicating motion in a time-lapse.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
