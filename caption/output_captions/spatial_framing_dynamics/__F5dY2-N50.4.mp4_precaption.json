    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a garden scenery shot, capturing a tranquil, private outdoor space. A path of dark, rectangular stepping stones leads from a smooth, light-colored patio across a sandy area towards a backdrop of dense, green tropical foliage, where a prominent, dark-barked tree stands. In the foreground, a round, dark-colored table with a glass top rests on the patio. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on conveying the serene and secluded atmosphere of the tropical environment. The camera's movement serves to reveal the layout and features of the space rather than to follow a specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene during the daytime shows a patio area leading into a sandy garden. The foreground features a smooth, light-gray floor with a round, dark-colored table that has a glass top. On the table sits a small, white, square box. A path made of rectangular, dark gray stepping stones extends from the patio across the light-colored sand. The garden is enclosed by dense, green tropical foliage and trees, including a prominent tree with a thick, dark trunk in the center. A low, light-colored wall runs along the left side of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot with no main subjects, capturing an outdoor garden path. Initially, a patio occupies the bottom foreground, featuring a round table in the bottom right. A path of stepping stones extends from the bottom center foreground into the sandy middle ground, where a large tree stands in the center-right. A low wall runs along the left edge, and dense foliage fills the background. The camera, positioned at a standard height, moves forward and slightly to the right. As it advances, the foreground patio diminishes, and the table shifts toward the bottom right corner, while the stepping stone path and the sandy area become more central, moving closer to the viewer.",
