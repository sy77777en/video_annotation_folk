    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a serene streetscape in a quiet Japanese town on a damp, overcast day. The scene opens with a black sedan traveling along the wet asphalt road toward the right side of the frame. As the camera advances and pans to the right, a white compact car and a red hatchback navigate the winding, rain-slicked road. The stationary camera perspective invites viewers to absorb the tranquil atmosphere and details of the neighborhood, from the architecture to the flow of daily life. In the foreground, a brick-lined traffic island with a leafy tree and yellow flowers sits beside a patch of red-painted pavement. Across the street, a modern white building with \"EXTERIOR GARDEN\" signage and a small palm tree contrasts with more traditional residential houses, all under a web of overhead power lines against a cloudy sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, the scene captures a wet street corner in a Japanese town on an overcast day. Initially, a black sedan is seen driving along the wet asphalt road toward the right side of the frame. In the foreground, a curved traffic island with a low brick wall is filled with green plants, yellow flowers, and a leafy tree. A portion of the sidewalk is painted bright red. The dark, wet asphalt of the road reflects the gray sky as cars, including a white compact car and a red hatchback, navigate through the winding, wet road. Across the street, modern commercial buildings with large windows are visible, one featuring a prominent sign for an \"EXTERIOR GARDEN\" and a small palm tree. Traditional Japanese houses with tiled roofs are seen on the left, and a dense network of overhead power lines crisscrosses the sky. The camera pans slowly to the right, following the flow of traffic.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, eye-level shot of a Japanese street corner, with several cars moving through the scene. Initially, a curved traffic island with a tree and flowers occupies the left foreground and middle ground, while a wet road curves from the bottom center to the right. As the camera slowly pans to the right, it follows the flow of traffic. A black sedan, initially in the center, moves out of the frame to the right, followed by a white compact car and a red hatchback that travel across the middle ground. This panning motion shifts the composition, moving the traditional houses on the left out of view and bringing a modern building with \"EXTERIOR GARDEN\" signage from the right middle ground to a more central position. Throughout the shot, the traffic island remains a constant element in the left foreground, and a network of overhead power lines is visible across the top of the frame.",
