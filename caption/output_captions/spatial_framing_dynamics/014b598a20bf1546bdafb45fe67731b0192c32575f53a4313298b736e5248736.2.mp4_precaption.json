    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the size of the subject in the video. If it\u2019s not clear, describe how much of the subject is visible.\n\nNext, describe the **subjects and elements\u2019 spatial position in the video**. Indicate their approximate 2D position within the frame, such as **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, centre**. Describe their 3D position within the frame, such as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Try to analyze as many elements as you can see. Each time you mention an element, you need to explain its 2D and 3D position in the frame.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end of  this text. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes within the frame, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.  \n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scene in this video but do not capture their spatial framing and dynamics. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on it completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and dynamics in this video. The given caption is only to help you learn the video thoroughly, so don't rely on it too much. Focus on the Spatial framing and dynamics and don\u2019t write too much about the subject appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person dressed in a Spider-Man costume, characterized by its iconic red and blue colors with web patterns. This individual is positioned inside a gazebo-like structure, initially crouching low to the ground. As the video progresses, the person stands up, revealing more of the costume's details, including the mask covering the head and black sneakers. Another person, dressed in a Spider-Man Noir costume, is visible in the background, walking. The Spider-Man-costumed individual remains the central focus throughout the video, with their movements transitioning from a crouched to a standing position.**\n\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor urban setting, likely a public square or park, characterized by a large, ornate gazebo with a wooden ceiling and intricate metalwork. The area is surrounded by modern buildings and leafless trees, suggesting it might be late autumn or winter. The sky is overcast, indicating cloudy weather. In the background, there are some people walking and a statue of a person standing near the gazebo. The focal point of the video is a person dressed in a Spider-Man costume performing acrobatic moves inside the gazebo. The individual is seen crouching, then leaping upwards, and finally landing gracefully on one leg, showcasing agility and athleticism. The gazebo's structure and the surrounding urban landscape provide a contrast between the fantastical action of the Spider-Man figure and the everyday environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of the subjects, capturing their entire figures within the frame. Initially, the Spider-Man-costumed individual is positioned in the center-left of the frame, crouching low to the ground in the foreground. As the video progresses, this person stands up, moving towards the center of the frame while remaining in the foreground. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subject, ensuring the full figure is visible throughout the transition. In the background, another person dressed in a Spider-Man Noir costume is located towards the right side of the frame, walking away from the gazebo. This individual stays in the background, providing depth to the scene. The gazebo's structure occupies the middle ground, with its ornate metalwork and wooden ceiling framing the subjects. The surrounding urban landscape, including buildings and leafless trees, forms the backdrop, situated further back in the scene. The camera angle remains consistent, focusing on the Spider-Man-costumed individual's movement from a crouched to a standing position, while the other elements maintain their positions within the frame.",
