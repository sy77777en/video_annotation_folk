    "pre_caption": "This is a static, extreme wide shot captured from a high-angle, top-down perspective, looking down on a miniature model of a desert town that fills the entire frame. A network of roads is laid out across the middle ground, forming a grid in the center with curved loops on the left and right sides. Numerous small, white buildings are positioned along these roads throughout the frame, with a larger structure situated in the upper-center. The sandy, pockmarked desert terrain serves as the base layer for the entire scene. Throughout the shot, individual buildings intermittently disappear from various locations across the town\u2014notably on the left, bottom, and right peripheries\u2014leaving behind red marks on the ground where they once stood.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a high-angle scenery shot of a miniature model depicting a small, isolated town in a barren, sandy desert landscape. The pockmarked and uneven terrain is crisscrossed by a network of dark, drawn roads, arranged in both a grid and curving loops, which connect numerous simple, white, block-like buildings. Several of these structures have small patches of red on the sections that are disappearing, adding a subtle, ominous detail to the scene. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish the setting and convey a sense of scale and desolation, focusing on the environment as a whole rather than any individual element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, top-down perspective, the scene captures a small settlement situated in a vast, sandy desert. The brown, pockmarked terrain is crisscrossed by a network of dark roads laid out in a grid with curved streets on the outskirts. Numerous small, white, block-like buildings are arranged along these roads. A larger, more complex white structure is located near the upper-center of the settlement. As some of the white buildings disappear, bright red cross-sections are revealed. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays \"[5,26],\" which disappears later in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
