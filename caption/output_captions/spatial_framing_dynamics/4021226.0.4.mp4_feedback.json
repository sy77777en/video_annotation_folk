    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot captures a person in a red and blue jacket positioned on the left side of the frame, holding a large red delivery bag in the center foreground. To the right, a second person wearing an apron is partially visible in the middle ground, standing before a commercial kitchen in the out-of-focus background. The person on the left begins with the bag's main lid held open, then proceeds to fold down an inner flap and close the main lid over the top of the bag. The camera remains static and positioned at the subjects' level throughout this action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a red and blue jacket holds a large, red and black insulated food delivery bag. The bag has black velcro patches and a silver-colored interior lining. The person closes the bag's main flap. To the right, another person is partially visible, wearing a light-colored apron over a blue short-sleeved shirt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Inside a commercial kitchen with stainless steel counters and equipment in the background, a person in a red and blue jacket handles a large, red, rectangular insulated bag. The bag, which has black trim and velcro fasteners, is opened to reveal a red lid and a silver-lined interior before being closed. Another individual wearing an apron is partially visible standing next to them.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
