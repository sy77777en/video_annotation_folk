    "pre_caption": "The video is presented as a wide shot from a first-person perspective. Initially, two humanoid figures occupy the middle ground, one positioned left of center and the other right of center. They are framed by large shipping containers in the middle ground\u2014a grey one on the left and a red one on the right. The foreground consists of a sandy ground with small plants, while dilapidated buildings form the background. The camera moves forward slightly, and after the left figure is hit and vanishes, the camera pans to the right. This pan reveals more of the environment, bringing a stack of red and green shipping containers into the center of the frame. A new humanoid figure emerges from the right and walks toward the center, while the original right-side figure is now positioned more to the left. The camera continues its rightward pan, following the new subject as it moves through the middle ground. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a vibrant, surreal scene reminiscent of a first-person game. The player throws yellow droplets at various characters, causing them to disappear upon impact. A purple humanoid figure is seen holding a pink basket and walking on a sandy surface, dressed in a matching purple outfit with shoes and a helmet-like head. Surrounding the figure are large, colorful shipping containers, some stacked and others with visible symbols. After the purple figure is hit, the camera pans to the right, revealing additional colorful characters. The setting includes urban elements like tall buildings with numerous windows, and the ground is scattered with small plants and rocks, creating an eclectic and vibrant atmosphere with a mix of industrial and whimsical elements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, reveals an outdoor, urban-like environment with a dirt ground. The area is populated with large shipping containers, some stacked, in colors like dark green, red, and grey, many featuring a white circular logo with two triangles inside: one right-side up and the other upside down, positioned next to each other. In the background, dilapidated multi-story buildings with numerous windows and some hanging banners are visible under a bright, clear blue sky. Small, green, cactus-like plants and floating clouds of purple particles are scattered across the ground, along with small, yellow, glowing orbs. Overlay elements include a health or status bar in the top left, a circular minimap in the bottom right, text at the top center reading \"Reactionary,\" and instructional text in the upper right corner reading \"Stop the people with laundry. You can click or LB/RB to aim your vape oil better.\" At the bottom center, text reads \"Current pill: THC Extract,\" and a circular icon with a yellow droplet is in the bottom left. In the top left, under \"Island XP: 241,\" \"So-Tep Items\" lists \"Dirty Clothes.\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video showcases an FPS game perspective set in an outdoor place with many shipping containers. Various humanoid subjects in different colors appear, each getting hit one by one by the first-person character using yellow, droplet-shaped, dart-like projectiles, causing them to disappear. Overall, it's a wide shot of different humanoid subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
