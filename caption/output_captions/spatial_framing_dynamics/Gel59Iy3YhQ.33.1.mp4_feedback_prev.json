    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot presents a fixed, side-view of a symmetrical, multi-level video game stage that fills the middle ground. Initially, a purple-robed character is positioned on a platform in the bottom center-left, while a crowned character is on a corresponding platform in the bottom center-right. The purple character then jumps up to a higher platform on the far left, and the crowned character jumps to a platform on the far right, where chests appear beside them. Overlays for \"P1\" and \"P2\" are initially in the bottom center foreground but are later replaced by \"DRILL ARROWS\" text overlays that appear in the middle ground, next to each character on the left and right sides of the screen. The entire scene is set against a dark, starry background and is framed by ornate borders on the far left and right. The camera remains stationary and level with the overall scene throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel art video game scene, two characters are present. The character on the right, designated as P1, is a figure wearing a golden crown and blue and purple clothing, and equipped with a shield. The character on the left, designated as P2, is a figure clad in a purple robe and hood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view 2D gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile, shows a symmetrical, multi-level indoor stage with a pixel art style. The structure is composed of dark blue and purple brick platforms and walls, accented with icy formations. The background is a dark, starry void with faint, stylized patterns. Several torches with red-tipped flames are fixed on the background patterns. Small golden chests appear on platforms on the far left and right. The scene is framed on the left and right by an ornate, dark purple border. Overlays in the bottom center initially display \"P2\" in purple and \"P1\" in blue, with an orange crown icon above \"P1.\" \"DRILL ARROWS\" appears as an overlay on both the right and left sides of the screen subsequently.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
