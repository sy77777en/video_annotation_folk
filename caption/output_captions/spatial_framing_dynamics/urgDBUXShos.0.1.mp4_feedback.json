    "pre_caption": "The shot begins with a medium close-up of a man in clown makeup positioned in the left foreground. The camera then pulls back and arcs to the right, following the man's movement, which brings a woman into the right side of the frame. The shot settles into a close-up that frames both subjects, with the man on the left and the woman on the right, both in the foreground. Throughout the scene, blurred figures of other guests occupy the middle ground, and the lights of a city skyline are visible through windows in the deep background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with white clown makeup, black-ringed eyes, and a smeared red smile moves on the left, facing a woman on the right. The man has greasy, shoulder-length dark hair with green tints and wears a dark purple suit jacket over a dark shirt and tie. The woman has brown hair styled in an updo and is wearing a dark green dress with short sleeves and embellished straps. They are positioned close to one another, engaged in a face-to-face interaction, maintaining their respective positions on the left and right sides of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at night within a dimly lit room in a high-rise building, where a formal gathering is taking place. Large windows in the background provide a view of a dark city skyline punctuated by distant lights. The interior is filled with numerous guests in formal attire, who appear as blurred figures in the background. In the foreground, a man wearing a purple jacket and a woman in a dark green dress stand close together, central to the surrounding social event.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot begins with a medium close-up of the clown. The camera then follows the clown's steps in an arc backward, keeping the clown on the left side of the frame while the female character appears and remains in the right half of the frame. Finally, it transitions to a close-up shot of both characters.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
