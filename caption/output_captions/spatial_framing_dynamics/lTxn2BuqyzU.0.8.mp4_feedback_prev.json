    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an extreme close-up of a cartoon boy's face, which is centered in the frame. A green vine is positioned in the foreground, emerging from his nostrils and hanging centrally over his mouth. The camera then pulls back to a medium shot, revealing the boy in the center of the frame, now flanked by two other children who appear on the left and right sides. All three subjects are positioned in the middle ground. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A cartoon boy with light skin, reddish freckles across his nose and cheeks, and short, dark brown hair is shown in a close-up. His large, black eyes are wide, and his mouth is slightly agape. A green, curly vine with small, dark green, clover-like leaves hangs out of both of his nostrils, extending down past his mouth. At the end, two of his deskmates appear on either side of him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a brightly lit, indistinct indoor setting, the scene presents a close-up of a cartoon boy's face. He has light skin with reddish freckles across his nose and cheeks, large dark eyes, and dark hair. A green, leafy vine emerges from his nostrils, curling down in front of his slightly open mouth. The vine is smooth and features small, three-lobed leaves. The background is a blurry, light-colored, and non-descript space.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
