    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A featureless, solid blue human figure, seen from the back, stands in the foreground. Through the window of a black car, a second featureless human figure, rendered in solid red, is visible sitting in the driver's seat. The red figure is shown in profile, facing towards the left. Both figures have a smooth, mannequin-like appearance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit setting, a blue, featureless figure stands in the foreground with its back to the viewer, partially obscuring a black vehicle. Through the car's side window, the profile of a red, featureless figure can be seen in the driver's seat. The vehicle has a glossy black finish with bright, linear highlights along its roof and window frame. Clear, bold white text is overlaid at the bottom of the screen, reading, \"They find a sober but weak Ted Bundy. He lost over 20 pounds and barely managed to steer the car.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a blue figure is positioned in the right foreground with its back to the camera. In the middle ground, a black car occupies the left and center of the frame. Through the car's window, a red figure is visible in the center-left of the frame, also in the middle ground, sitting in profile and facing left. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
