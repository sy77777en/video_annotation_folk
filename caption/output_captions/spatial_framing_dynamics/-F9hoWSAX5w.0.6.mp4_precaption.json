    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the open space and natural elements like trees and the overcast sky. The absence of a specific main subject emphasizes the mood and setting rather than any particular object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of an outdoor basketball court surrounded by a chain-link fence. The setting is a park-like area with bare trees, suggesting late autumn or winter. The court is wet, indicating recent rain, and puddles are visible on the ground. In the background, there are tall buildings, hinting at an urban environment. The sky is overcast, contributing to a muted, gray atmosphere. The scene is devoid of people, emphasizing the stillness and quiet of the setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of an outdoor basketball court enclosed by a chain-link fence. The camera remains stationary throughout, offering a consistent view of the scene. The basketball court occupies the center of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. The fence forms the immediate foreground, with its gate slightly ajar, positioned centrally along the bottom edge of the frame. Bare trees line the background, stretching across the top left and top right sections of the frame, while tall buildings appear further back in the distance, situated towards the upper middle part of the scene. Puddles on the court surface are scattered across the middle ground, reflecting the overcast sky above. The camera's height is level with the fence, providing a direct view of the court and surrounding elements without any noticeable elevation or angle change. There are no significant shifts in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the video, maintaining a steady perspective on the environment.",
