    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a Black male positioned behind a hole in a wooden board, with the board in the foreground and the man in the midground. He is wearing a white t-shirt and has short hair and a beard. The camera captures him from a straight-on angle, centering him against an open landscape visible through the hole. As the sequence progresses, the man falls backward in slow motion, gradually descending out of the frame. The camera remains fixed, keeping the hole as a natural frame while the subject exits the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases an outdoor setting in a rural area, viewed through a hole in a wooden wall. A Black man is positioned behind the hole, with the wall in the foreground and the man in the midground. The scene behind him features an expansive field, a distant horizon, white clouds, and a wide sky, suggesting daytime. As the video progresses, the man is no longer present, leaving only the view of the field and horizon. The setting is characterized by its simplicity and natural elements, with the wall providing a unique frame for the scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of a Black male standing in front of a hole in a wooden board, framed by the jagged edges of the hole. The camera uses a straight-on angle, centering the subject against the open landscape visible through the hole. As the sequence progresses, the man falls backward in slow motion, gradually descending from the frame. The camera maintains its fixed position throughout, keeping the hole as a natural frame within the shot while the subject exits the scene.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a Black male, viewed through a rough, circular hole in a wooden surface positioned in the foreground. This hole acts as a frame, centering the man in the middle ground against a background landscape of a field and cloudy sky. The camera maintains a fixed, straight-on angle relative to the man. During the shot, the man moves backward and downward, eventually disappearing below the bottom edge of the hole's view, leaving only the foreground frame and the background landscape visible.",
