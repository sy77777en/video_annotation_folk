    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a close-up scenery shot of a luxurious poolside at night. The focus is on the overall atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating an immersive environmental view. The pool water glows with an ethereal green light from below, its surface dotted with dark leaves. Arcing jets of water, catching the green luminescence, spray into the pool from its stone edge. In the background, a large house with a tiled roof is softly illuminated by warm wall lanterns, and tall palm trees are silhouetted against the dark, starry sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, a swimming pool is illuminated from below by a vibrant green light, with dark leaves floating on its surface. Several arcing streams of water, appearing a light turquoise color, spray from the stone edge and splash into the pool. In the background, a house with a tiled roof has warm lights glowing from its windows and from exterior lanterns. The area is surrounded by the dark silhouettes of palm trees and other foliage against the night sky, with lounge chairs visible on the pool deck.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, low-angle scenery shot of a poolside at night. The pool occupies the foreground and the bottom half of the frame. In the middle ground, the pool's edge runs horizontally across the center. A house is visible in the background, positioned in the left and center of the frame, with palm trees silhouetted behind it across the top. Initially, a single jet of water arcs from the left-center middle ground into the foreground pool. A second jet then appears to its left, followed by a third, larger jet that enters from the right side of the frame, also arcing into the pool. The camera remains static throughout the shot.",
