    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a stick-figure character with a round head and a small, pointed hat, riding a simply drawn bicycle. The bicycle is adorned with small, colored squares (blue, green, red) near its back. Accompanying this character are thick, black, hand-drawn lines that form a cut path. Also present are a black, hand-drawn musical quarter rest symbol and the hand-drawn black numeral \"6\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view video, where the camera is placed to the side capturing the scene in profile, depicts a minimalist outdoor environment against a plain, light gray background. Thick, black, curved and straight lines form a path across which a small, stick-figure-like character on a bicycle moves from left to right. Other black, abstract shapes, including a musical quarter rest symbol and a numeral \"6\" with an adjacent diagonal line, are visible. The black lines constituting the terrain appear to shift, creating a sense of movement through this stark, graphic landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot, with the camera at the subject's level. Initially, a stick-figure cyclist is positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, riding on a thick black line that extends from the left edge. A black musical quarter rest symbol is in the middle ground, to the right of the center and slightly below the cyclist, while a black numeral \"6\" with an adjacent diagonal line is in the middle ground at the bottom center. As the cyclist moves from right to left across the frame, the black lines forming the path continuously shift leftwards and reconfigure; for instance, the numeral \"6\" and its diagonal line transform into a curved path segment that the cyclist then rides upon. The quarter rest symbol also moves, initially to the right of the cyclist, then shifting towards the top left of the frame before exiting. By the end of the clip, the cyclist is moving leftwards on a central concave path segment in the middle ground, with other short, distinct line segments visible on the far left and far right of the frame.",
