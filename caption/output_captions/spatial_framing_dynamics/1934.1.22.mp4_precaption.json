    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young man dressed in white attire with orange stripes, including a long-sleeved shirt, pants, gloves, and a cap, with a light skin tone.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases an indoor setting with a minimalist stage design. The environment features a stark black backdrop, creating a dramatic contrast with the subject dressed in a white outfit, complete with a cap and gloves. The stage includes a raised platform and a large panel on the left side, contributing to the abstract aesthetic. The bright lighting emphasizes the contrast between the subject and the dark background. As the scene progresses, the subject moves from the higher black platform to a lower one. The overall scene is devoid of additional props or furniture, focusing on the simplicity and visual impact of the contrasting colors and shapes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a young man dressed in white attire with orange stripes, moving across a minimalist stage. Initially, he stands on a raised black platform located in the upper center of the frame, with the camera positioned below him. He begins his movement by stepping off the platform, transitioning from the top center towards the middle of the frame. As he descends, the camera shifts to match his level, maintaining a full shot. He continues his motion, moving horizontally across the stage from the center towards the left side. The large panel on the left side of the frame remains static in the background throughout the sequence. The subject's dynamic movement contrasts sharply with the static elements of the stage, emphasizing his actions against the stark black backdrop. The camera maintains a consistent horizontal angle, capturing the subject's fluid transition from the raised platform to the lower stage area.",
