    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two figures resembling young boys, both presented as completely black silhouettes. The boy on the right has large, round, glowing white eyes, which are his only visible facial feature. The second boy, positioned to the left, is also a black silhouette but does not have glowing eyes. This second figure is holding a thin, straight object, similar to a stick, in his right hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a dark, monochromatic landscape. The foreground features an uneven, black, silhouetted ground. In the background, large, indistinct vertical structures are heavily obscured by a thick gray fog or mist, creating a hazy atmosphere. Two small, silhouetted figures of boys are visible; one on the right with glowing white eyes runs across the terrain, while another figure is positioned on the left.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot presents two silhouetted figures against a hazy, monochromatic background. A figure with glowing eyes is positioned in the right middle ground, running toward the left. A second figure holding a stick is in the left middle ground, also moving slowly to the left. A dark, uneven ground occupies the foreground across the bottom of the frame, while large, indistinct structures are visible in the foggy background. The camera pans slightly to the left, keeping both figures within the frame as they move. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
