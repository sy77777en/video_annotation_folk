    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a light complexion, dark hair, and a short beard dives headfirst into turquoise water. He is shirtless and wears red, white, and blue striped swim trunks. His body is parallel to the water's surface, with his arms bent and hands open in front of him. His legs are bent upwards, kicking up a splash as he enters the water. The man then fully submerges and disappears beneath the surface, leaving behind a larger splash.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunlit expanse of calm, turquoise water, a man wearing red, white, and blue striped swim trunks is captured mid-fall. Positioned horizontally just above the surface, his body creates a significant splash as he enters the clear sea. The scene is set against a simple backdrop of the expansive, bright blue water under a clear sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot begins with a man positioned horizontally across the center of the frame, diving into the water in the middle ground. As he moves from left to right, his body submerges, and he disappears entirely from view. The shot concludes with the resulting splash in the center of the frame, leaving only the water's surface visible. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
