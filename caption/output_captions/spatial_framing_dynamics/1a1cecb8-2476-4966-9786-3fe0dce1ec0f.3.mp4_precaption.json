    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person with pink hair, wearing glasses and a black mask, positioned on the far left. Only part of their upper body is visible, occupying about 10% of the frame's width. The person is facing forward, with their head slightly turned to the right. The scene is set against a street backdrop with a decorative metal railing and trees, including one with purple blossoms.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot in an outdoor urban setting during the early evening. The scene features a paved walkway bordered by a decorative black metal railing with a stone base. On the left, a multi-story brick building with large windows is visible. Trees with green and purple foliage line the far side of a pedestrian walkway, indicating a park-like area. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene. Street lamps with a warm glow line the path, adding to the ambiance. The environment is calm, with no visible movement, suggesting a peaceful moment in the city.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a street scene with a person with pink hair, glasses, and a black mask positioned on the far left of the frame. Only part of their upper body is visible, taking up about 10% of the frame's width.",
    "pre_caption": "The video captures a medium shot of a street scene, focusing on a person with pink hair, glasses, and a black mask on the far left, occupying approximately 10% of the frame's width. This individual is positioned in the foreground on the left side, with their upper body visible and their head slightly turned towards the right. The camera remains at the subject's height throughout the sequence. The decorative metal railing with a stone base runs horizontally across the middle ground, extending from the left edge towards the center-right of the frame. In the background, a multi-story brick building with large windows is situated on the left side, while trees with green and purple foliage line the far side of the pedestrian walkway, occupying the middle ground and extending into the background. The trees are positioned centrally and towards the right side of the frame. Street lamps with a warm glow are placed along the path, appearing in the middle ground on the right. The sky, overcast and diffused, forms the top portion of the background. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position of the elements within the frame; the camera maintains a steady perspective, capturing the scene consistently.",
