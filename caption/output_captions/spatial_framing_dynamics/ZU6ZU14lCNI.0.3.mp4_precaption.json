    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, seen from behind, as she walks toward and then descends a set of stairs leading to an underground passage. She is wearing a long, tan-colored coat and carries a black purse with a chain strap over her right shoulder. As she goes down the stairs, she places her left hand on the metal railing for support.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On a city street in Chicago during a winter dusk, a woman in a tan coat descends a staircase into an underground garage. The entrance, marked by a blue sign that reads \u201cGRANT PARK N GARAGE, 25 N Michigan Ave, Randolph Lobby,\u201d is framed by dark, ornate metal railings. To the left stands a large, light-colored stone building, and to the right, a city bus moves along the street, which has patches of snow. The scene is lit by streetlights under an overcast sky, with other pedestrians and traffic visible in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a medium shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a city street, with the entrance to an underground passage positioned in the bottom center foreground. A large building occupies the left side of the frame, while a street with a moving bus is on the right. A woman then enters from the top left and walks toward the center, at which point the framing becomes a medium shot of her from behind. She proceeds to descend the central staircase, moving from the middle ground deeper into the foreground. Throughout her descent, the camera remains positioned above her, following her movement as the ornate metal railings of the staircase frame her on the left and right.",
