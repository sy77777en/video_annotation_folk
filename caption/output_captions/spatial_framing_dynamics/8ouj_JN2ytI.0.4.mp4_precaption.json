    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of men, appearing to be American football players, stand in a line. The man on the far left wears a white jersey with the number 91 in blue and green, blue pants, and a blue headband; he has a dark mark running down the middle of his face and a pair of black eyes. Next to him, a light-skinned man with short blond hair wears a similar white jersey with the number 83. To his right, a dark-skinned man with a short beard and a blue headband wears a white jersey with the number 81. Beside him, another dark-skinned man with a blue headband wears a white jersey with the number 6. All these players have \"RAPID CITY\" printed on their chests, hold blue helmets with \"RCM\" in green, and wear serious expressions. Further to the right, other players in similar uniforms are partially visible. On the far right of the line stands a light-skinned man with short dark hair, wearing a blue hoodie and holding a blue and green cap.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor football stadium during the day, a line of players stands on the sideline. The players are wearing white jerseys with blue and green accents, featuring the words \"RAPID CITY\" in blue text across the chest and large green numbers. They hold their blue helmets, which have a green and white logo on the side. In the background, the stadium stands are filled with a large, blurred crowd of spectators, many of whom are wearing yellow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a group of American football players standing in a line on the sideline of an outdoor stadium. The players are positioned from left to right across the frame, occupying the foreground. The man on the far left, wearing a white jersey with the number 91, is positioned at the left edge of the frame. Next to him, the player with the number 83 stands slightly to the right, followed by the player with the number 81, and then the player with the number 6. These players are centrally positioned, with their bodies facing forward and their helmets held in front of them. On the far right, a man in a blue hoodie stands at the edge of the frame. In the background, the stadium stands are visible, filled with a blurred crowd of spectators, predominantly wearing yellow, creating a sense of depth. The camera is at the subjects' eye level, maintaining a consistent height throughout the scene. The framing remains steady, focusing on the players' upper bodies and expressions, with no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning.",
