    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man wearing a helmet, a black long-sleeved shirt, and bright orange pants performs a stunt on a black bicycle. He rides up a blue ramp, which is mounted on a flatbed train car and features a Red Bull logo, launching into the air. He lands on top of an adjacent large, blue shipping container, also on a train car, which has a horizontal red stripe and the word \"PRADA\" in large white letters. A green combine harvester is visible in the background behind the train.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Set in a rural landscape under a clear blue sky, a train moves straight to the left on tracks beside a lush cornfield. The train is composed of flatbed cars, one of which is fitted with a blue ramp featuring a red \"Red Bull\" logo. A cyclist rides up this ramp and jumps onto an adjacent large, blue shipping container marked with a horizontal red stripe and the word \"PRADA\" in white. On each side of the train, there is a red-and-white railroad crossing sign. Behind the train, on the left, is the cornfield, and on the right is a green combine harvester. The ground surrounding the tracks is dirt and grass.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed at the subject's level, initially frames a cyclist in the center of the screen, positioned on a blue ramp located on the left side of a train that extends across the middle ground. A cornfield is visible in the background on the left, while a green combine harvester is positioned in the middle ground behind the train. The train itself occupies the lower portion of the frame. The cyclist rides up the ramp, launching into the air and moving in an arc from the center towards the top right of the frame. He then lands on top of a large blue container, also on the train, which is situated on the right side of the frame, completing his movement from left to right across the scene.",
