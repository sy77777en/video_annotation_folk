    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pair of light-skinned hands holds a gold-colored smartphone horizontally on a white surface. The phone's screen is on, displaying the iOS home screen. A white paper strip with handwritten numbers from 2 to 9 is taped across the top of the screen. The right hand holds a silver, pen-like metal tool with a pointed tip and is actively scratching the surface of the phone's screen, moving along the numbered guide. The left hand steadies the top of the phone. In the background, a black rectangular object with a white label reading \"JerryRigEverything\" is visible, along with the tips of other small screwdrivers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective shows a scene set on a clean white surface. A pair of hands holds a gold-colored smartphone, its screen illuminated with colorful app icons. A white paper strip with handwritten numbers from 2 to 9 is taped across the top of the screen. One hand uses a silver, pen-like metal tool with a pointed tip to systematically scratch the glass screen, moving along the numbered guide. In the background, other precision tools and a black and white branded object with the text 'JerryRigEverything' are visible on the white surface.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a close-up, top-down shot, a gold-colored smartphone is held horizontally, occupying the center of the frame. In the foreground, a left hand is positioned on the top left, while a right hand is on the bottom right, holding a silver metal tool over the phone's screen. The tool, located in the center-right foreground, moves horizontally across the phone's screen, which is in the middle ground. A white paper strip is taped across the top of the phone, also in the middle ground. In the background, a black rectangular object is visible at the top, and the tips of other tools are on the top right, all resting on a white surface.",
