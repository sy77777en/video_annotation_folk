    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames an anthropomorphic alligator in the left foreground, shown from the chest up and facing toward the right. A large speech bubble overlay occupies the top center and right portions of the frame, with a small crown icon overlay fixed in the bottom right corner. The background consists of a hallway with a door on the far left and another on the right, with a wall lamp positioned between the alligator and the right door. The camera slowly pans to the right, causing the background elements to shift leftward within the frame, bringing the right door more toward the center. The alligator remains stationary in the left foreground throughout the pan.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An anthropomorphic green alligator named Pat is shown from the chest up, facing towards the right. The alligator has large, round, white eyes with black pupils, a long snout with visible sharp white teeth, and is wearing a purple bandana tied around its neck. On its head, it wears a light-colored baseball cap with a dark letter \"P\" on the front. A large, white speech bubble appears next to its head, containing black text. A small box at the top of the speech bubble displays the name \"Pat.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a monochromatic indoor hallway with a vintage aesthetic. The walls feature a floral wallpaper pattern above dark wainscoting, and a patterned carpet with circular designs covers the floor. Wall-mounted lamps with flame-like bulbs illuminate the scene, and dark wooden doors with decorative handles and keyholes are visible in the background. A green, cartoon alligator character, adorned with a bandana and a cap, walks in the foreground. An overlay in the upper right of the scene consists of a large speech bubble containing text, with a small name tag labeled \"Pat\" at its top. Another overlay, a small black crown icon, is present in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is difficult to infer camera height relative to subject for 2d videos.
