    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A herd of alpacas populates the landscape. These animals have long necks, slender legs, and shaggy wool coats in shades of brown, cream, and white. Initially, they are scattered across a grassy hill, with some standing, others sitting, or walking. Several alpacas then begin to run. Some alpacas pass very close to the camera before moving out of view, primarily due to camera movements. A single white alpaca is also visible standing alone in the distance before moving out of view from the bottom right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone glides over a vast, high-altitude mountain valley on a bright, sunny day. In the distance, a massive range of jagged, snow-capped mountains stands against a blue sky with a few white clouds. The foreground is a rolling landscape of brownish-green hills covered in grass, moss, and scattered rocks. A herd of brown and white alpacas is spread on the terrain. As the drone moves forward and low to the ground, it passes by the animals as they move on the hilly landscape. By the end of the video, small streams are visible in the lower areas of the foreground.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera begins with an extreme wide shot of a group of alpacas running. It moves forward and downward to present a wide shot of alpacas running, and exits the scene. Finally, it shows an extreme wide scenery shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Initially, the camera is positioned above the subject. It then moves forward and downward to the subject\u2019s height. Finally, no subjects remain in the frame.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot from a high angle, showing a herd of alpacas scattered across the middle ground of a vast mountain valley. A range of snow-capped mountains occupies the background on the top left, with a large brown hill in the middle ground on the right. The camera then moves forward and descends, transitioning to a wide shot at the alpacas' height. Several alpacas in the center middle ground begin to run; one passes from the center-left into the immediate foreground and exits on the left, while others move toward the right foreground. A single white alpaca is briefly visible in the right middle ground before exiting from the bottom right. As the camera continues its low, forward trajectory, the alpacas leave the frame, and the shot becomes an extreme wide view of the scenery, with small streams appearing in the foreground at the bottom.",
