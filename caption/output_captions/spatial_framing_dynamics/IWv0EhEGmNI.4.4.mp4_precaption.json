    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective seen through a green-tinted night-vision display, a person wearing light-colored gloves holds a black assault rifle. The rifle, equipped with a red dot sight, is pointed downward through a rectangular opening in a floor or ceiling, peering into a dark space below. A digital heads-up display, featuring a vertical bar and numerical readouts, is visible on the left side of the view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, looks down through a rectangular opening in a floor into a dark room below. The entire scene is cast in a monochromatic green hue, consistent with night vision. A rifle equipped with a red dot sight is held in the foreground, aimed into the space below, where a dimly lit room or corridor with a visible doorway can be seen. A heads-up display overlay is visible on the left side of the screen, featuring a vertical gauge and other digital readouts.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a rifle is positioned in the bottom right foreground, aimed downward through a rectangular opening that occupies the center of the frame. A digital heads-up display is overlaid in the foreground on the left. Through the opening, a dimly lit room is visible in the middle ground and background. The camera, positioned high and looking down, slowly tilts further downward and slightly to the left. This movement reveals more of the floor and the space to the left within the room below, while the rifle and HUD maintain their relative positions within the frame.",
