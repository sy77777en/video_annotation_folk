    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with light skin is shown in a close-up, kneeling on the floor and leaning forward, fully focused on a drawing. They are wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt with thin, dark vertical stripes. Leaning over a piece of paper, they firmly grip a dark, thick crayon or charcoal stick in their right hand, while their left hand holds the paper steady. Only the lower part of their face, from the nose down, is visible as they look down intently at their work. Other crayons, including red and black pieces, are scattered on the floor around the paper.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a warmly lit indoor setting, a person wearing a striped shirt leans close to a piece of paper resting on a carpeted floor. Their hand grips a dark, stick-like crayon, moving it across the paper to draw. Several other small, dark drawing implements are scattered on the floor around the paper. The softly blurred background features windows and a carousel-like figurine, adding depth and interest to the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static close-up shot, a person's hands are positioned in the center-foreground as they draw on a piece of paper. The right hand, holding a dark drawing tool, is centrally located, while the left hand rests on the right side of the frame, holding the paper steady. The person's upper body and the lower part of their face occupy the upper right and center of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. The paper and several other crayons are scattered across the bottom of the frame in the immediate foreground, with a softly blurred background visible in the upper left. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
