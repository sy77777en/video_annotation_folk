    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a young lion positioned slightly to the right of the center in the frame, standing amidst tall, dry grass. The lion occupies the middle ground, with the grass extending into the background, creating a natural savanna setting. The camera is at the lion's eye level, capturing its facial expressions as it opens its mouth and wrinkles its nose. The surrounding grass, with thin, leafless branches and sparse green shoots, fills the frame, providing texture and depth. The bright, natural light highlights the lion's fur and the grass, enhancing the scene's vividness. The framing remains consistent throughout, maintaining focus on the lion's expressions and the immediate environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young lion with tawny fur and light-colored eyes is shown in a close-up view. It stands amidst tall, dry grass, its mouth open, revealing its teeth and pink tongue. The lion's expression evolves as it wrinkles its nose, its eyes narrowing slightly, its brows subtly furrowing, and its lips drawing back slightly.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunlit savanna, a young lion stands amidst a field of tall, dry grass with a hint of green. The dense vegetation is punctuated by thin, leafless branches and sparse green shoots. Bright, natural light illuminates the scene, casting a slight sheen on the lion's tan fur and highlighting the texture of the surrounding grassland.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
