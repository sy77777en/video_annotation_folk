    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the foreground on the left, a stylized, low-polygon male figure rendered in light yellow is seated in a light-colored armchair, facing the camera directly. The figure has an angular, faceted appearance and is wearing what resembles a collared shirt. In the midground slightly to the right, two figures are seated on another set of light beige chairs. The turquoise low-polygon female figure on the left is sitting upright with her back to the camera, facing the male figure on the right. The light yellow low-polygon male figure on the right has his left leg crossed over his right, with his hands resting in front of him. Additionally, a pink low-polygon figure is walking forward in the center of the frame, slightly to the left of the camera, with a natural gait. She is positioned in front of a large Christmas tree. These are the only four figures present in the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a spacious, modern lounge with beige walls and a polished tile floor, illuminated by a warm light source. Several light-colored, contemporary armchairs are arranged in the area. In the background, a Christmas tree decorated with white lights stands near a large window with vertical blinds. The scene features stylized, low-poly human figures: a light yellow figure is seated in an armchair in the foreground, two figures are sitting opposite each other in the right midground, and a translucent pink figure walks through the middle of the room. A small white font \"[2]\" is located in the lower left corner of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, where a light yellow, low-polygon figure is seated in the left foreground. In the right midground, two other figures are seated in chairs, while a Christmas tree stands in the center-left background. A pink figure then enters from the left foreground and walks toward the center-left midground, passing in front of the tree. As this occurs, the camera pulls back, transitioning into a full shot that reveals more of the lounge environment. In the final composition, the foreground figure is in the bottom left, the walking figure is in the center-left midground, and the two seated figures are in the right midground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
