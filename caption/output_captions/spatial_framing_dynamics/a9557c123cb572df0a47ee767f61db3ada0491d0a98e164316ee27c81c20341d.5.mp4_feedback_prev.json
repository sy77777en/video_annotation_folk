    "pre_caption": "The scene opens with a centered, forward-moving perspective through a tunnel of concentric rings. Initially, textured rings with embedded pentagons occupy the foreground and middle ground, framing the view. Closer to the center, smoother, glossy rings are positioned in the middle ground, leading to a bright white circle in the background at the exact center of the frame. As the camera advances, the central white circle expands to fill the frame, while the outer rings in the foreground and middle ground move outward and eventually exit the shot. The video ends with the white circle dominating the view, framed only by the innermost smooth ring, which is now in the foreground. The camera maintains a level height, aligned with the central axis of the tunnel throughout its forward motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A view of a tunnel-like structure reveals a series of nested concentric rings. The rings with a dark, metallic material and a textured diamond plate pattern, studded with small silver-colored metallic pentagons, are not the outermost ones. Closer to the center, the rings are smooth, black, and glossy. At the center of the composition is a bright, solid white circle that contrasts with the surrounding dark structure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-moving perspective travels through a dark, abstract installation of concentric circles composed of multiple rotating rings. The outermost rings are dark grey with a textured diamond plate pattern, while the inner rings are smoother and black with a slight sheen. Small, silver, pentagonal objects are embedded at intervals along some of the rings. The camera steadily advances toward a bright, white, circular void at the center, which appears to grow larger due to the camera's forward movement, eventually filling most of the view and framed only by the innermost black ring.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

Due to the lack of reference objects, terms such as foreground, middle ground, and background should be avoided in the description.
