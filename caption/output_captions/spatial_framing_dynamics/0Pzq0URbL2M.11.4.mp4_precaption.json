    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of men seated in a row at a long table. They are all wearing similar attire, consisting of light-colored shirts and pants. The men have varied hairstyles, with all of them having short hair. They are positioned closely together, facing the same direction, suggesting a sense of uniformity and focus. The lighting is dim, casting shadows that emphasize the collective presence of the group rather than individual features. The overall composition highlights the uniformity and alignment of the subjects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a dimly lit, minimalist environment. A long, dark table extends across the scene, surrounded by a row of identical chairs. Seated at the table are multiple figures, all wearing similar attire, facing away from the viewer. The lighting is subdued, casting soft shadows and creating a reflective surface on the floor. The atmosphere is calm and still, with no visible movement or activity. Overlays include a small text element in the bottom left corner, which reads \"[25,28]\" and is not part of the scene itself.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a group of men seated in a row at a long table. Initially, the camera captures the subjects from a side angle, showing them from the left side of the frame towards the right. As the video progresses, the camera gradually pans to the right, transitioning from a side view to a rear view of the subjects. In the initial state, the men are positioned in the middle ground, with some closer to the foreground on the left and others receding into the background on the right. By the end of the pan, they are all aligned centrally in the frame, viewed from behind. The table and chairs occupy the lower half of the frame, extending horizontally across the scene. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. The lighting casts soft shadows, enhancing the depth and alignment of the group. The reflective floor beneath adds a subtle layer to the spatial composition. There is no significant change in the subjects' positions relative to each other; they remain seated and stationary. The small text overlay in the bottom left corner remains static throughout the sequence.",
