    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot focused on the front of a dark green car, which is located in the center of the frame and the middle ground, with a man visible in the driver's seat. The shot then transitions by pulling back into a wide shot, revealing the entire car and several people within a concrete underpass. The car remains in the center middle ground with all its doors open as people exit from both the left and right sides, moving to stand beside the vehicle. The wider framing shows concrete support pillars in the foreground and middle ground on the left and right, defining the space. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit parking garage, a dark green Volvo sedan with yellow-tinted headlights and a Finnish license plate reading \"UYZ-639\" is parked with all its doors open. A man with dark skin and a bald head is visible in the driver's seat, and a yellow beaded necklace hangs from the rearview mirror. Several other people with dark skin are exiting the car. A woman wearing a light blue hijab and a light blue and green patterned t-shirt over a dark long-sleeved shirt gets out from the rear passenger side. Another woman, wearing a white head covering and a dark jacket, also exits from the passenger side. From the driver's side, a man in a dark jacket and dark pants with an orange pattern gets out, as does another man wearing a dark jacket.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit concrete underpass or parking garage, a dark green Volvo sedan is parked with its yellow-tinted headlights on. The vehicle, which has a license plate reading \"UYZ-639,\" is positioned centrally under sparse overhead lighting that creates a stark contrast with the surrounding shadows. Several people are exiting the car through its open doors, moving into the dark, cavernous space defined by concrete walls and support pillars.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
