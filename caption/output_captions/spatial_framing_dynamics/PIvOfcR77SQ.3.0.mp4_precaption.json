    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot capturing the essence of a winter setting. The focus is on the snowy environment, with an emphasis on the overall scene, including the snow-covered ground and buildings. The camera zooms in on a house, highlighting the colorful plastic sleds lined up against the red wooden wall, adding a touch of detail to the serene atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a snowy outdoor setting featuring a small red wooden cabin with a white snow-covered roof. The cabin is situated in a wintry landscape with snow blanketing the ground. Brightly colored sleds, including green and red ones, are propped against the cabin's exterior. In the background, another building is partially visible. The camera then zooms in to the sleds, and there is a small snowplow behind the red cabin coming out to the right. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cold, cloudy day. The scene is calm, capturing the serene atmosphere of a winter day.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a snowy outdoor setting. Initially, the entire scene is visible, showing a red wooden cabin with a white roof in the center of the frame. The cabin occupies the middle ground, while the snowy ground and another building in the distance form the background. The brightly colored sleds are positioned against the cabin's wall, located towards the left side of the frame in the middle ground. As the camera zooms in, the sleds become more prominent, filling the left portion of the frame. A small snowplow appears from the right side of the frame, moving into the middle ground. The camera remains at eye level relative to the cabin, providing a consistent perspective throughout the sequence. The spatial composition shifts slightly as the camera focuses on the sleds, but the overall framing maintains a clear view of the cabin and surrounding snowy landscape.",
