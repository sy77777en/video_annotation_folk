    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A humanoid character is depicted wearing a gold helmet, a blue top, and brown bottom, with elaborate armor featuring large, spiked pauldrons and a helmet with prominent, wing-like adornments. This character wields a weapon that emits a red glow and is initially seen carrying a large, ornate shield on their back, later transitioning to holding it with one hand. Nearby stands a second humanoid figure in brown and metallic armor, also equipped with a large, ornate shield. On the dark, corrupted-looking ground near them, several patches of orange fire initially form a semi-transparent humanoid shape, which is visible and follows their movement. A large, white and gold angelic-looking structure with wing-like features and a glowing center is positioned on the ground between two tall, slender pillars that rise from a base emitting a bright blue light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the setting is a large platform at the top of a building within a fantasy environment. The architecture consists of tall, gold-trimmed pillars, and there are trees with hanging blue crystals visible in the surrounding middleground, with more distant, elaborate buildings in the background. The light-colored stone floor is partially consumed by a dark, tar-like corruption, upon which a charred black object is visible. Blue glows are emitted from the bases of both pillars on either side of the platform, and a large, angelic-looking monument is centrally positioned between them. Several overlays frame the scene: a heads-up display with health, resource orbs, and a skill bar spans the bottom of the screen. In the top right, a minimap is displayed alongside the location name, \"GARDENS OF HOPE 2ND TIER,\" the time \"8:32 PM,\" and an \"OBJECTIVES\" list. The top left corner shows character portraits, and a text log appears in the bottom left.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot from a high-angle perspective, a humanoid character in gold armor is initially positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground. A second humanoid character stands to their right, with patches of fire on the dark ground near them. To the left, a large, angelic-looking structure rests in the middle ground, flanked by two tall pillars on the left and right sides of the platform. In the background, crystalline trees and distant architecture are visible. The main character and their companion then move from the center toward the left side of the frame, passing the angelic structure as the fire patches follow them. UI elements are overlaid in the foreground, with a skill bar at the bottom, character portraits in the top left, a minimap in the top right, and a text log in the bottom left.",
