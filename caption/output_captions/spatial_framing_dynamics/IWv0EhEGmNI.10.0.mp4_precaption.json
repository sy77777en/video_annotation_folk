    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video provides a first-person perspective of an individual wearing tactical gloves, holding a firearm equipped with a holographic sight. The scene is illuminated by a green night vision effect, rendering all elements in shades of green. The sequence begins with the individual throwing a grenade with their right hand, igniting an enemy figure in front, who appears partially visible and engulfed in vivid, neon green flames. Following this, the individual draws their firearm and shoots. The firearm has a metallic, matte finish, and the person maintains a steady grip, with their hands and weapon consistently in the foreground. The night vision effect gives the subjects a distinct, high-contrast appearance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is presented from a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, and takes place outdoors at night in a dimly lit area with a green night vision effect that casts a monochromatic hue over the scene. The environment features stone or concrete barriers and low walls, with some structures and silhouettes of buildings visible in the background. The ground appears uneven, with debris and some vegetation scattered throughout the area. The environment itself has a few scattered, faint light sources, while occasional bright, glowing green flames on the ground ahead are the result of enemies being burned by the player's thrown grenades, providing stark contrast against the otherwise dark surroundings. The character\u2019s hands and a firearm are visible in the foreground, rendered in the same green-tinted night vision style. Overlay elements include a heads-up display (HUD) with ammunition count and weapon icons in the lower right corner, as well as aiming parameters on the left. A small text overlay with dialogue in red appears near the bottom center of the view. These overlays are not part of the physical scene but are superimposed for informational purposes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.\n\nDon't describe it by the number of frames or pictures, describe it by the smooth transition of the video angle.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective, with the viewer\u2019s hands and weapon consistently occupying the lower center and lower right foreground of the frame. The environment, visible in the middle ground and background, consists of stone or concrete barriers and low walls that stretch horizontally across the frame, with some structures and silhouettes of buildings further back, mostly in the upper and central background. At the start, the right hand moves from the lower right foreground to throw a grenade toward the center middle ground, where an enemy figure becomes partially visible and is engulfed in bright green flames, positioned slightly right of center in the middle ground. The firearm is then brought up to the lower center and right foreground, remaining steady and aligned with the viewer\u2019s line of sight. The camera height matches the subject\u2019s eye level, maintaining a consistent horizontal perspective throughout the sequence. Overlay elements, such as the HUD and dialogue text, are superimposed in the lower right and bottom center of the frame, but do not interact with the physical space. The spatial arrangement remains stable, with the main dynamic being the movement of the hand and weapon in the foreground and the appearance of flames and the enemy figure in the middle ground.",
