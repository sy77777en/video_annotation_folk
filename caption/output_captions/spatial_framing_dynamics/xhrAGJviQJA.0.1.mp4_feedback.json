    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot, with the camera positioned high above the scene. A person carrying a bicycle is in the middle ground, located slightly left of the frame's center, ascending a large, steep hill that occupies the foreground and middle ground on the right side. A vast, arid landscape is visible in the background to the left, under a cloudy sky at the top of the frame. As the person climbs upward and toward the right, the camera moves closer and repositions itself, transitioning the shot into a wide shot. The camera's final position is below the subject, creating a low-angle view that shows the person silhouetted against the sky as they move toward the top center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a red shirt and red pants is seen climbing a steep, sandy hill. The individual is carrying a bicycle directly on their shoulders while walking on sand dunes, with a black backpack on their back as they make their way up the incline.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a vast, arid landscape during sunrise or sunset, with the low sun casting long shadows and a warm, golden light. The scene is dominated by a steep, barren hillside of brown earth in the foreground. In the distance, a wide expanse of rolling hills and valleys stretches to the horizon under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. A person wearing red pants and carrying a bicycle on their back is seen ascending the steep slope of the foreground hill. Sparse, low-lying green vegetation is visible in the lower elevations of the landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to below the subject.",
