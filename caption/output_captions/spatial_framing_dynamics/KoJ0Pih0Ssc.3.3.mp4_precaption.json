    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two featureless, humanoid figures, rendered in a solid, glowing red, are shown from a low angle. The figure on the left holds a long, thin red object vertically with both hands, looking upwards, resembling someone holding a rifle. The figure on the right holds a shorter, red, rod-like object in a manner resembling someone aiming a rifle, pointing it upwards and to the right. Both figures are stylized and lack any discernible clothing, hair, or facial features.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective, the scene is set at night in an urban environment, with a large, grey building featuring lit windows against a dark sky. In the foreground, two glowing red, featureless humanoid figures are depicted. One figure holds a long, thin red rod horizontally, resembling the way one would hold a rifle. To the right, the second figure holds a shorter red rod horizontally, as if aiming it. The overall scene has a monochromatic color scheme, with the figures providing a stark red contrast.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium shot is captured from a low-angle perspective, looking up at two red, humanoid figures positioned in the foreground. The figure on the left occupies the bottom-left of the frame, while the second figure is positioned in the bottom-right. In the background, a large, grey building fills the upper-right and center portions of the frame, set against a dark sky. The spatial composition remains static throughout the shot.",
