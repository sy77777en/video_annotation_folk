    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of individuals in traditional attire, with the main focus on a man in the center. He is wearing a white robe, a black belt, and has long, light-colored hair styled in a topknot, along with a long, light-colored beard. His expression is serious, and he stands prominently at the forefront. Surrounding him are several men dressed in yellow and black robes, wearing black hats. They appear to be accompanying or following the main subject. The setting suggests a traditional or historical context, with architectural elements visible in the background. The group is positioned on steps, indicating a hierarchical or formal arrangement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor scene set in front of a traditional East Asian temple, characterized by its ornate, curved roof and intricate architectural details. The setting is during the day, with clear skies providing ample natural light. Stone statues flank the entrance, adding a sense of grandeur and historical significance. The temple's structure is made of dark wood, contrasting with the light stone steps leading up to it. A group of individuals in traditional attire, featuring robes in shades of white and yellow, are positioned on the steps, suggesting a formal or ceremonial gathering. The environment is calm, with no visible movement or weather effects, emphasizing the temple's serene and timeless atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot, capturing the entire group of individuals and the temple in the background. The main subject, a man in a white robe, is positioned in the center of the frame, standing on the steps in the foreground. He is surrounded by men in yellow and black robes who are also on the steps, forming a semi-circle around him. These accompanying figures are distributed evenly across the frame, with some on the left and others on the right. The temple, with its ornate roof and stone statues, occupies the background, spanning from the left to the right side of the frame. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing more closely on the main subject while still including the surrounding individuals. In this new shot, the main subject remains in the center, but the camera angle brings him closer, making his upper body more prominent. The accompanying figures are now less visible, appearing smaller and partially cropped out. The temple continues to serve as the backdrop, though less of its details are visible due to the tighter framing. Throughout the sequence, the camera maintains a position below the subjects, looking up at them, which emphasizes their elevated position on the steps.",
