    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Inside a greenhouse with a curved metal frame and translucent plastic sheeting, a single, large-leafed green plant, possibly a squash or pumpkin, grows in the center of the dark, tilled soil. A thin wooden stake is placed next to the plant for support, and over time, the number and position of the stakes change, with one or two stakes appearing at different times. Several long, black, flexible drip irrigation pipes run in parallel lines along the ground. Laid perpendicularly across these pipes are several light-colored wooden planks. In the background on the left, several black pots contain flowering plants with pink and white blossoms, but in the latter part of the video, these pots are no longer visible, and the area is instead occupied by green plants in white pots.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Inside a long, arched greenhouse with a translucent plastic covering, tilled soil is arranged in rows with black irrigation hoses running along the ground. A single, large-leafed green plant grows prominently in one of the rows, supported by a thin stake. Wooden planks are laid across the soil at intervals. Initially, black pots contain pink and white flowering plants, but as the view pans slightly to the right, these are replaced by green plants in white pots on a wooden structure. The shadows of trees from outside cast upon the plastic walls.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide, high-angle shot initially frames a large-leafed green plant in the center-left middle ground of a greenhouse. Several black irrigation pipes run from the foreground toward the background, with wooden planks laid across them in the middle ground. In the top-left background, black pots containing flowering plants are visible. A thin wooden stake is then added to support the central plant. Subsequently, the camera pans slightly to the right, causing the plant to shift toward the center of the frame. This movement also brings the black pots out of view on the left, replacing them with green plants in white pots situated on a wooden structure in the top-left background.",
