    "pre_caption": "From a first-person point of view, the shot looks directly down from a high, rocky precipice. The subject's neon yellow gloved hands are positioned in the bottom foreground, resting on the jagged cliff edge that occupies the lower half of the frame in the middle ground. A vast valley stretches out in the background, filling the top half of the frame. The camera, representing the person's head, pans slightly to the right, shifting the view across the cliff edge. The hands in the foreground adjust their position on the rocks, with a bare hand briefly appearing in the bottom right. The camera is positioned at the subject's height, looking down.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person point of view, a person stands at the edge of a rocky precipice. They are wearing a bright, neon yellow wingsuit. The top of a dark-colored helmet is visible at the bottom of the view. The person's hands are held out in front, and at one point, a bare hand is briefly seen as they adjust their position on the cliff edge.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a view from the edge of a high, rocky mountain peak. Bright yellow wingsuit is visible in the middle ground, positioned on the jagged, gray scree of the precipice. Far below, a vast valley stretches out, featuring green patches of vegetation and winding white lines of a river or road. The surrounding landscape is composed of steep, rugged mountain faces under a daytime sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
