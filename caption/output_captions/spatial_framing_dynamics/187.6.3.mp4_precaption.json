    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows four people inside a car, viewed from the front through the windshield. The person on the left is a woman wearing a headscarf, a light-colored turtleneck, and a dark jacket, with a calm expression. Next to her is another woman in a dark headscarf, partially obscured, appearing to be speaking. The third person, in the back seat, is wearing a light headscarf and is slightly turned towards the others, engaged in conversation. The driver, on the right, is a woman with short hair. The scene captures a medium shot of their upper bodies, highlighting their interactions and expressions.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an indoor setting within a car parked in a garage, contributing to the dim lighting. The interior of the car is softly illuminated, creating a subdued atmosphere. The car's interior features light-colored seats, and a string of beads hangs from the rearview mirror, adding a personal touch. The car is stationary, focusing on the occupants inside. Subtitles at the bottom of the screen display the dialogue: \"Fardosa, What's going on? - She's in her own world.\" The overall mood is calm and introspective, with the car's enclosed space providing a sense of intimacy.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is mounted on the car's front, facing inside the vehicle through the windshield. There are four passengers in the vehicle, with their chest-up bodies visible. It overall creates a medium shot, even though most of their upper bodies are hidden by the vehicle.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of four individuals seated inside a car, captured from the front through the windshield. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. The person on the left side of the frame occupies the passenger seat in the foreground, while the driver is positioned on the right side, also in the foreground. Between them, in the middle ground, sits another individual slightly turned toward the others, and behind them, in the background, is the fourth person. The car's interior, including light-colored seats and a hanging string of beads from the rearview mirror, is visible in the middle ground. The spatial arrangement remains static, with no noticeable changes in the subjects' positions or the camera angle. The dialogue subtitles appear at the bottom of the frame, indicating ongoing interaction among the occupants. The overall composition emphasizes the enclosed space of the car, with all subjects clearly visible from the chest up.",
