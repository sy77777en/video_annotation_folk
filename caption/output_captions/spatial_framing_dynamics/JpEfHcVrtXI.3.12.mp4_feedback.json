    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a dimly lit room, where a small, child-like figure in a bright yellow raincoat stands on the raised end of a tilted wooden seesaw, positioned centrally in the frame. The figure occupies the middle ground, while the wooden dresser is located to the left in the foreground, with some drawers ajar, and several wooden toy blocks scattered on the floor in front of it. A simple wooden swing hangs from the ceiling on the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground. Initially, the camera is at the subject's height, capturing the scene from a level perspective. As the shot progresses, the camera shifts to a higher position above the subject, providing a broader view of the room and emphasizing the spatial arrangement of the elements. The only significant light source is the small lighter held by the figure, which casts a glow that illuminates the character while leaving the surrounding area in deep shadow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, child-like figure stands on the raised end of a tilted wooden seesaw. The figure is entirely covered by a bright yellow raincoat with a prominent, pointed hood that completely obscures its face. It holds a small, lit lighter, which illuminates the character. Also visible are a worn wooden dresser with some drawers ajar, several wooden toy blocks on the floor, and a simple wooden swing hanging in the background. The objects appear aged and are set within a very dark, shadowy space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person 3D game video, where the entire character is visible on screen, takes place in a dimly lit room with dark, plain walls and a wooden plank floor. A thick, dark pipe runs along the top of the back wall. To the left is a wooden chest of drawers with some drawers open, and several toy blocks are scattered on the floor in front of it. In the center of the room, a small figure in a yellow raincoat holding a light stands on the raised end of a wooden seesaw. To the right, a simple wooden swing hangs from the ceiling. The only significant illumination comes from the character's light, casting a small glow and leaving the rest of the room in deep shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
