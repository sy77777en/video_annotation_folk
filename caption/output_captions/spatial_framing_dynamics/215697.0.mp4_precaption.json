    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a vast, abstract cosmic scene filled with swirling clouds of gas and dust in various shades of blue, green, and purple. Numerous small, bright stars are scattered throughout, creating a sense of depth and vastness. The colors blend seamlessly, giving the impression of a dynamic and expansive universe. The overall composition suggests a celestial environment, possibly representing a nebula or a distant galaxy. The visual elements are fluid and ethereal, emphasizing the complexity and beauty of the cosmos.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an expansive view of outer space, featuring a vast, star-filled cosmos. The setting is outdoors in the infinite expanse of the universe, with no specific location on Earth. The time of day is irrelevant in this context, as the scene is set in the timeless void of space. Notable visual elements include swirling nebulae with hues of blue, green, and purple, creating a textured and ethereal backdrop. Countless stars are scattered throughout, varying in brightness and size, and flicker intermittently, adding depth and dynamism to the scene. The overall atmosphere is serene and otherworldly, with the nebulae's gaseous formations appearing soft and cloud-like against the dark, infinite void.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video showcases an expansive cosmic scene with no distinct major subjects. The swirling nebulae and stars occupy the entire frame, creating a dynamic and fluid composition. The nebulae, in shades of blue, green, and purple, are distributed across the frame, with some clusters more prominent in the top left and right areas. These nebulae appear in the background, providing a sense of depth. The stars are scattered throughout, with some brighter ones located near the center and others dispersed towards the edges. The camera remains stationary, capturing the vastness of the scene without any noticeable movement or change in perspective. The spatial arrangement emphasizes the ethereal and complex nature of the cosmos, with the nebulae and stars maintaining their positions relative to each other throughout the sequence. The camera's height is not applicable in this context, as the scene is set in the boundless expanse of space.",
