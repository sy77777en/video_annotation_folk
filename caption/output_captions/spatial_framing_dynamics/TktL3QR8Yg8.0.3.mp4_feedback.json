    "pre_caption": "The scene opens on an interior setting, with a wooden chair visible in the right background and a rocking horse in the left background. A hand enters from the top left of the frame and places a teddy bear on the floor in the center foreground. The shot then tightens to a medium close-up, focusing on the bear's upper body, which now occupies the center of the frame. The background elements become out of focus, creating a shallow depth of field. As the bear sits stationary, a hand enters from the top of the frame and places a cap on its head. Throughout this sequence, the camera remains at the bear's eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A worn, dark brown teddy bear is the central subject. The plush bear has a fuzzy, slightly matted texture and visible stitching, giving it an aged appearance. It features mismatched eyes: one is a large, dark, four-holed button, while the other is a smaller, dark bead. A brown, flat, round bead forms its nose. Around its neck is a faded pink scarf tied in a knot. A light-skinned human hand places a dark gray, soft cap on the bear's head. The cap, made of a fabric or leather-like material with prominent stitching, complements the bear's button eye.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a nostalgic interior setting, a worn, pinkish-brown teddy bear with mismatched button and bead eyes and a faded pink scarf sits on a dark surface. The room is dimly lit with a warm, soft glow, highlighting a wooden dressing table with a round, vintage mirror at its center. To the right, a wooden high-back chair is visible, while a metallic rocking horse is positioned to the left. The background wall features delicate floral patterns, and the floor is wooden. As the scene progresses, the background blurs, drawing attention to the teddy bear as a hand places a dark, stitched cap on its head.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video takes place in a home setting. It starts with a background featuring a chair, a vanity, and a rocking horse. A hand then places a plush bear on the floor in the foreground, showing its upper body. The focus shifts to the bear, and the hand puts a hat on its head.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject, and the camera height remains unchanged.",
