    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a static, level shot where a beige wall occupies the right foreground and a yellow wall is on the left, framing a central view into a hallway. A person enters the frame from the right, their back to the camera, and settles in the center of the frame, establishing a medium shot that captures them from the mid-torso down. They walk directly away from the camera, moving from the middle ground deeper into the background of the hallway. As they recede, they remain centered but become progressively smaller and more out of focus. In the distant background, a wooden stool is visible through a doorway. The camera remains stationary and at the subject's height throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with a light skin tone is shown from the back, walking away from the camera. They are wearing a dark blue, long-sleeved sweatshirt over a longer, patterned tunic with a curved hem. The tunic has an abstract pattern in shades of grey, black, and white. The individual is also wearing black leggings. Their arms are held down at their sides as they walk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a level-angle, moving leftward viewpoint, the scene captures an indoor hallway with warm, ambient lighting. The walls are painted in shades of beige and yellow. In the foreground, a soft, out-of-focus surface frames the view. A person, seen from the back, walks away down the hallway. In the background, visible through a doorway, are a wooden stool and a dark curtain next to a window with blinds. The overall focus is soft, creating a shallow depth of field.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a casual indoor scene, initially out of focus. A person wearing a blue top and black leggings enters from the right with their back turned, with only their hips, hands, and part of their arms visible. As they walk away from the camera and go out of focus, more of their midsection becomes visible, though it remains roughly a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject, and the camera height remains unchanged.",
