    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A series of animated graphics are displayed on a dark grey map background. The sequence begins with a teal-colored section representing the country of Uruguay, upon which sit isometric illustrations of a white sports car and a white yacht. Gray chains then appear, wrapping around both vehicles. The scene then changes to a world map, where Uruguay is highlighted in teal and the country of Turkey is highlighted in red. A glowing yellow arched line connects the two countries, with the text \"80,500,000 $\" written along its curve.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds on a dark gray background, presenting a series of animated maps. It begins with a view of South America, where the country of Uruguay is highlighted in a solid teal color. Within this highlighted area, there are isometric illustrations of a white sports car and a white yacht. Chains then appear, wrapping around both vehicles. As the zoom continues, a world map is revealed, with the country of Turkey highlighted in red. A yellow arched line extends from Turkey to Uruguay. Several elements are visible throughout the sequence: \"Uruguay\" is displayed within the country's borders, \"80,500,000 $\" follows the curve of the yellow line, a disclaimer overlay appears later in the video reading, \"Disclaimer: Exchange values from 2017, not inflation-adjusted,\" and a credit overlay is visible at the bottom left throughout the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a map of Uruguay positioned in the center-left of the frame, layered over a darker map in the background. In the foreground, an isometric white car and yacht are placed on the left and right sides of the Uruguay map, respectively, viewed from a high angle. Chains then animate, wrapping around both vehicles. The camera then zooms out, transitioning to a top-down view of a world map that fills the frame. During this transition, the Uruguay map shrinks and settles in the bottom-left, while the country of Turkey is highlighted in the top-right. A glowing yellow line animates, drawing an arc from Turkey in the top right to Uruguay in the bottom left, with the text \"80,500,000 $\" appearing along its curve in the upper-left quadrant.",
