    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a level-angle view, showing a person's arms and hands pouring a clear liquid from a small, bright red, square-shaped bucket. The perspective then shifts to a bird's-eye view. The person, who has a dark skin tone, is wearing a dark, long-sleeved garment and a silver-colored bracelet on their left wrist. They are seen tilting the red bucket, causing the liquid to splash and cascade downwards.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit, narrow indoor space, a person's arms hold a red, square container, pouring water that splashes onto the wet floor. The area is enclosed by what appears to be translucent plastic sheeting, with a vertical partition down the center. A bright light source from the right side illuminates the scene, creating a hazy glow and casting shadows. The video has a vintage, low-fidelity quality with a noticeable reddish tint and horizontal scan lines. The entire scene is presented within black framing bars on all four sides, which are an overlay on the video.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person pouring water from a red bucket. Only their arm and part of their body are visible, while the red bucket is fully visible at the center of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a level-angle close-up, where a person's arm extends from the left foreground to hold a red bucket in the center of the frame. The scene is divided by a vertical partition in the middle ground, with translucent sheeting in the foreground and background creating a narrow depth. The camera then moves upward, shifting the perspective to a high-angle, bird's-eye view. In this final framing, the person's arms are positioned in the bottom left of the frame, reaching toward the center to tilt the bucket. The liquid cascades downward through the middle of the scene, illuminated by a light source from the right. The entire scene is contained within black framing bars on all four sides.",
