    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark, silhouetted landscape, a small, slender creature with two long, pointed ears stands on a ledge, its form outlined by a bright, swirling cyan light in the sky. To the right, a much larger, bulky, dark creature with a rounded, owl-like silhouette is seen in mid-air, as if jumping or floating away.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video captures a nighttime scene in a silhouetted forest. The dark blue landscape features hilly terrain with large, leafy trees and undergrowth. Dominating the background is a vast, swirling expanse of bright cyan light, from which crackling tendrils of energy emanate. The ground is sparsely dotted with small, glowing white specks. A small, silhouetted figure stands on a hill, while a larger, rounded silhouette is visible on the right side of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a silhouetted landscape is framed by a large tree in the left middle ground and another on the right. A small, slender creature stands in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a hill. Behind this figure, a large, swirling mass of bright cyan light dominates the background. To the right, a larger, bulky creature is initially seen in the middle ground before it moves toward the bottom right of the frame, appearing to jump or float away. The foreground and middle ground are dark, dotted with small, glowing white specks. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
