    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small red panda with reddish-brown fur and a bushy ringed tail is visible through a rectangular window, though its features are somewhat obscured by the glass and reflections. As the view shifts, two adults appear, dressed in casual clothing of various colors and styles, both standing and looking down at something in their hands. The red panda is visible from inside a room, separated from the adults by the window.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors in a landscaped garden area bordered by a textured, light brown wall with a large window reflecting trees and wooden structures. The setting features a well-maintained grassy lawn with scattered rocks, small trees, and shrubs, as well as a black metal staircase with wooden steps leading upward. A beige fence with horizontal slats encloses the area, and as the camera moves, a sign featuring a photo of a red panda can be seen on the fence, alongside signs with yellow, black, and blue backgrounds, as well as a QR code. Towards the end, a yellow sign hanging on the distant wall becomes visible. The environment is bright, indicating daytime, and the sky is clear, allowing sunlight to illuminate the greenery and cast soft shadows across the scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a small rectangular window, through which a small red panda can be seen, though not clearly. The camera then pans left to reveal it is inside a zoo, showing some visitors and the zoo scenery in a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera starts below the window frame, looking up at it. It then pans away while tilting to reach a level, eye-level angle.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a small rectangular window positioned in the left half of the frame, with the red panda visible behind the glass in the background, occupying the upper left area. The camera is initially below the window, angled upward. As the camera pans left and tilts upward, the shot transitions to a wide view of the outdoor zoo enclosure, revealing the landscaped garden and various elements. In this wide shot, the black metal staircase with wooden steps appears in the center and middle ground, while the grassy lawn, rocks, and shrubs fill the foreground and middle ground across the lower and central parts of the frame. The beige fence with horizontal slats runs along the background, occupying the upper part of the frame, with several signs, including a photo of a red panda and a yellow sign, visible on the fence and distant wall in the background. The camera ends at an eye-level height, capturing the entire scene with the elements distributed from foreground to background, and from left to right across the frame.",
