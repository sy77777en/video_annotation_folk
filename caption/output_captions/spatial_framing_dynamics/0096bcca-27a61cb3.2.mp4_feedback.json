    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from a vehicle's perspective. Initially, a brightly lit Gulf gas station occupies the middle ground from the center to the right of the frame, with its tall sign in the top left. A light-colored minivan is positioned in the foreground on the bottom left. As the camera moves forward and pans left, the gas station and minivan exit the frame to the right. An intersection with crosswalks enters the foreground, while a multi-story building and a city bus appear in the middle ground on the left. The camera continues forward through the intersection, causing the buildings and bus to recede into the background. The view then shifts to the road ahead, with streetlights and distant storefronts lining the sides of the frame in the middle ground and background. The camera is positioned at a height consistent with a vehicle's dashboard.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a drive through a city intersection at night. The scene is illuminated by streetlights, traffic signals, and the glowing signs of businesses, including a prominent Gulf gas station and various storefronts, with a few cars and a city bus visible at the intersection. The video lacks a main subject as the camera continuously pans and moves forward, presenting a broad view of the urban environment. The focus is on conveying the atmosphere and scale of the city at night rather than highlighting a specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures a drive through an urban area at night. The scene begins with a brightly lit Gulf gas station, its tall sign displaying the orange and blue logo, before the vehicle proceeds through an intersection. The streets are marked with white crosswalks and are illuminated by streetlights and the glow from storefronts, including one with a \"ROSES\" sign. Other vehicles, such as a light-colored minivan, an SUV, a city bus, and a van near a bus station, are present on the road. The camera pans left, revealing more multi-story buildings and traffic lights as the car continues its journey through the city.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
