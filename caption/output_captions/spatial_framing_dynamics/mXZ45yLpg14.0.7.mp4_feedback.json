    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a low-angle wide shot looking up at the canopy of tall, leafless trees against a foggy sky. The tree trunks extend from the bottom edge upwards, filling most of the frame, positioned in the middle ground and background. Broken tree stumps are visible in the foreground at the bottom left and center. The camera slowly tilts downwards, revealing more of the forest floor. A person wearing a hazmat suit enters the frame from the bottom right and walks slowly towards the center, stopping in the middle ground. The shot transitions to a medium shot, framing the person from the waist up, now positioned in the center of the frame. The trees form the background. The camera is now at the subject's eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a forest scene with tall, leafless trees reaching upwards, creating a stark and eerie atmosphere. As the scene progresses, a person wearing a protective suit becomes the focal point. This individual is dressed in an orange hazmat suit with a full-face respirator mask, obscuring their features. They carry a black backpack with attached equipment, including a yellow device, possibly for measuring environmental conditions. The person stands amidst the trees, suggesting a cautious exploration of the area. The overall mood is one of isolation and caution, emphasized by the protective gear and barren surroundings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting in a dense, foggy forest with tall trees reaching into a gray, overcast sky. Some of the trees may be pine trees with sparse needles. The atmosphere is eerie and still, with a muted color palette dominated by grays. The ground is covered in damp foliage, and the air appears heavy with mist. A person in a protective suit and gas mask stands among the trees, suggesting a hazardous environment. The suit is orange with black straps and equipment, including a gauge and a yellow device, adding a sense of caution and preparedness. The overall scene conveys a sense of isolation and quiet in a potentially dangerous natural setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a medium shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
