    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a landscape scenery shot, offering a close, out-of-focus perspective of a moss-covered stone wall in the foreground. Behind the wall, a line of lush green trees is blurred against a bright, overexposed sky. There is no distinct main subject; the shallow depth of field and soft focus emphasize the natural textures and create an atmospheric, almost abstract, impression of a tranquil outdoor environment. The focus is on the overall mood and setting rather than a specific object or figure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene is depicted from a low-angle perspective, looking past the top of a stone structure covered in yellow and green moss. Initially, the scene is blurry, but then the focus shifts to the wall in the foreground. However, due to the filters applied, the wall still does not appear completely sharp. In the background, a line of green trees is visible against a bright, overcast sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from a low-angle perspective, focusing on the natural environment rather than a specific subject. Initially, the entire frame is out of focus. The shot then pulls focus to a moss-covered stone wall positioned in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the background, a line of green trees remains blurred, stretching across the middle of the frame, with a bright sky occupying the top portion of the background. The camera remains static throughout this focus shift.",
