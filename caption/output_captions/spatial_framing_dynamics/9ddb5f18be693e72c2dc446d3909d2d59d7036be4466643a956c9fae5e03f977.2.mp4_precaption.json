    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A yellow, dimpled golf ball, speckled with dark dirt, rests on a patch of green grass. A silver-colored golf iron with a grooved face swings into view and strikes the ball, after which both the club and the ball exit the scene. In the blurred middle ground, a person's lower leg and foot are visible. The person wears light-colored trousers and a dark-colored shoe that has a white stripe and white laces.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective on a grassy field, a yellow, dimpled golf ball with dark scuff marks rests on the green turf. In the out-of-focus middle ground, a person's leg and shoe are visible, while in the out-of-focus background, a hazy sky and indistinct foliage can be seen. A silver-colored golf iron with a grooved face swings swiftly into the foreground, strikes the ball, and sends it flying out of the frame, leaving only the grass in view.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up of a person hitting a golf ball from ground level. In the background, one leg and foot of the person are out of focus, while the golf ball and club are in focus in the middle ground. As the club strikes the ball, both the club and the ball exit the frame. The leg and foot are still out of focus in the background.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a low-angle, close-up shot from ground level. Initially, a yellow golf ball is in focus in the foreground at the bottom left, while a person's out-of-focus leg and foot occupy the middle ground in the center-right. A silver golf club swings into the foreground from the top right, moving toward the ball. Upon impact, both the club and the ball are propelled out of the frame, leaving a static view of the grass in the foreground and the blurred leg in the middle ground.",
