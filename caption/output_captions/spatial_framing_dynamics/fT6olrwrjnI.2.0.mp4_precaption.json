    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two young men are depicted in athletic stances on a green field. The man in the foreground has messy white hair, fair skin, and is wearing a white sleeveless jersey with the number \"7\" in black, over a black long-sleeved undershirt. He is looking over his left shoulder. Positioned closely behind him is another young man with black, spiky hair and fair skin. He is wearing a red sleeveless jersey with the number \"18\" in black, also over a black long-sleeved undershirt, and appears to be marking the man in front of him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place on a brightly lit soccer field with vibrant green turf marked by a thick white line. Two players are shown in close proximity. One player wears a white sleeveless jersey with the number \"7\" in black, accented with black and blue details, over a black long-sleeved undershirt. The other player, positioned behind the first, is in a red sleeveless jersey with the number \"18\" in black, also worn over a black long-sleeved undershirt. Both jerseys feature a small, triangular yellow and green logo on the chest.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: A 2D anime scene where the camera mimics a high-angle shot above the two soccer players.",
    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle medium shot, two soccer players are positioned on a green field. The player with white hair occupies the foreground on the left side of the frame, while the player with black hair is in the middle ground, positioned slightly to the right and behind the first. A white line on the turf runs horizontally across the middle ground. The camera slowly zooms in, tightening the frame on the two players as they maintain their athletic stances.",
