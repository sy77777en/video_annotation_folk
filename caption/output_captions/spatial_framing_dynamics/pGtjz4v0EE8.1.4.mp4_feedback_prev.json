    "pre_caption": "In a static, high-angle wide shot, a cobblestone plaza is framed with an outdoor cafe under two white umbrellas positioned in the top right. Numerous people are scattered across the middle ground of the scene. A large, sunlit area occupies the left and bottom-left portions of the frame, while the rest of the plaza is in shadow. The people move in various directions: some walk from the top of the frame toward the bottom, others cross from left to right, and small groups are visible in the center and bottom areas. Their long shadows stretch across the plaza from the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a high-angle perspective, numerous people are seen moving about a gray cobblestone plaza. The crowd consists of men and women of various ages, all dressed in casual attire such as T-shirts, pants, and shorts in a variety of colors. They traverse the open space individually, in pairs, and in small groups. In the upper right portion of the scene, another group of people is visible, seated at tables beneath two large, white, square umbrellas at an outdoor eatery.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, overhead perspective, the video shows a large, open public square paved with dark grey tiles. On the right side of the scene, an outdoor cafe area is covered by two large, square, white umbrellas, with people seated at tables beneath them. Bright sunlight illuminates the left side of the plaza, creating long, distinct shadows from the numerous pedestrians walking across the space in various directions, both individually and in small groups. The rest of the square is in the shadow of an unseen building.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
