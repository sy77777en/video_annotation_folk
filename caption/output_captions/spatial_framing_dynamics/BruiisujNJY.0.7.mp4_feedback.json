    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a cityscape viewed from a high-angle perspective. The scene is framed in the foreground by the silhouette of a person's head on the left and a plant on the right. The cityscape, composed of silhouetted buildings, occupies the bottom of the frame, extending from the middle ground into the background. In the background, construction cranes are visible against a dramatic sky that fills the upper two-thirds of the frame. Small, dark particles float in the middle ground, positioned between the window and the distant city, adding depth to the static shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a cityscape view from inside a building, overlooking a metropolitan area at dusk. In the foreground, the dark silhouettes of a person's head and a leafy plant frame the view through a window. The skyline of buildings extends from the midground to the background, with construction cranes and the horizon positioned in the background. The most striking feature is the dramatic, ominous sky, filled with grey, swirling clouds and ethereal formations of orange and white light that resemble ghostly apparitions or energy fields. Small, dark particles like ash float in the air, contributing to the mysterious and unsettling atmosphere. The composition emphasizes the grand scale of this strange celestial event, making the environment itself the central point of interest rather than any specific character or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an indoor perspective, the scene looks out a window onto a city skyline at dusk. The foreground is framed by the dark silhouette of a person's head on the left and a leafy plant on the right. In the distance, a silhouetted cityscape with buildings and construction cranes sits under a grey, cloudy sky. The sky is filled with large, swirling, orange-white ethereal formations. Small, dark particles are visible, appearing to float in the air.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
