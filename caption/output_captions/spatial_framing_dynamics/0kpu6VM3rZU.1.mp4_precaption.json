    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the size of the subject in the video. If it\u2019s not clear, description how much of the subject is visible.\n\nNext, describe the **subjects and elements\u2019 spatial position in the video**. Indicate their approximate 2D position within the frame, such as **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, centre**. Describe their 3D position within the frame, such as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Try to analyze as many elements as you can see. Each time you mention an element, you need to explain its 2D and 3D position in the frame.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end of  this text. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes within the frame, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.  \n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scene in this video but do not capture their spatial framing and dynamics. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on it completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and dynamics in this video. The given caption is only to help you learn the video thoroughly, so don't rely on it too much. Focus on the Spatial framing and dynamics and don\u2019t write too much about the subject appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman as the main subject, wearing a shiny, metallic gold dress with thin straps. She has long, straight black hair and is holding a trophy in her right hand. Her expression is animated, and she appears to be speaking into a microphone held by another woman. The secondary subject, a woman with long brown hair in an updo, is wearing a light-colored, embellished dress and is holding the microphone labeled \"ET Canada.\" In the background, several people are visible, dressed in formal attire, suggesting a red carpet event. The main focus is on the interaction between the two women, with the trophy being a notable element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a lively outdoor event, likely a red carpet gathering, set in an urban environment. The scene is viewed from a broadcast POV shot, typical of television production, providing a clear and structured view of the event. It takes place during the evening, as indicated by the artificial lighting illuminating the area. The background features a large building adorned with decorative posters in red and white circular patterns, possibly part of a commercial or entertainment complex. The setting is bustling with elegantly dressed attendees, suggesting a formal occasion. The event is held outside the building in a tent-like structure with a transparent roof and curtains. Notable visual elements include a prominent red carpet and a backdrop with reflective surfaces. Overlays are present, including a logo and text identifying the broadcast network, positioned at the bottom left corner of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot, capturing the main subject from the waist up. The woman in the shiny, metallic gold dress is positioned slightly off-center to the right in the foreground, while the interviewer with long brown hair stands to her left, also in the foreground. The trophy is held in the main subject's right hand, near the center of the frame. The interviewer holds the microphone labeled \"ET Canada\" towards the main subject. In the background, several formally dressed individuals are scattered across the middle ground, creating depth. The backdrop includes a large building with red and white circular patterns, visible in the top right and extending to the left side of the frame. A transparent tent-like structure with curtains is noticeable in the upper portion of the background. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium close-up, focusing more tightly on the main subject's upper body and face, which shifts her further to the center of the frame. The interviewer remains partially visible on the left side. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subjects throughout, ensuring a direct perspective. The overall spatial dynamics emphasize the interaction between the two women, with the background elements providing context for the event's setting.",
