    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot, maintaining a static frame throughout. In the bottom left foreground, a green humanoid figure is seated at a wooden desk. Subtitles are overlaid in the bottom left foreground. Further into the scene, in the center-left middle ground, a figure with a grey and red patterned top sits at a desk, and to its right, in the center middle ground, another figure in a red top is also seated at a desk. Several empty wooden desks occupy the foreground and middle ground on the right. In the background, a standing grey figure is positioned to the center-left, near a white rectangular board on the left wall. To the right of this standing figure, in the center-right background, two more grey/white figures are seated at a table. Large windows line the left and center-left background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a room resembling a classroom or meeting space, occupied by six stylized, low-polygon humanoid figures. In the mid-background, a grey humanoid figure is positioned to the left of a table, facing the whiteboard on the left wall. This figure has its right hand on its chin and its left hand on its hip, suggesting a contemplative pose. Five other figures are seated at wooden desks arranged in rows. In the foreground on the left, a distinctly green figure sits at a desk. In the mid-background, two grey/white figures are seated at a table in front of the green figure; the figure on the left wears a garment with grey and red patterns, while the other wears a red top. Further in the mid-background, two more grey/white figures sit at a table behind the three figures in the foreground and mid-ground, facing towards them. All seated figures occupy black office chairs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting, resembling a classroom or lecture hall, with a minimalist, low-poly aesthetic. The room features dark gray walls and a light gray floor. Large, tall windows line one wall, allowing diffuse light to enter, though the outside view is obscured. Several rows of light brown wooden desks with dark metal frames are arranged facing the front of the room, with matching chairs that have dark brown seats and backs. At the front, a white rectangular board, possibly a whiteboard, is mounted on the wall. Six low-poly, monochromatic human figures are present: five are seated at desks throughout the room, and one is standing as if addressing the others. The overall lighting is even and subdued. An overlay of white text subtitles appears in the lower-left corner of the frame, changing from \"[12]\" to \"[13]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
