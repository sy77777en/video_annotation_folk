    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a sterile and unsettling liminal space, specifically a long, narrow corridor filled with murky, greenish water. The walls are uniformly covered in small, pale green tiles, and the scene is illuminated by rows of bright, square lights recessed into the ceiling, casting a cold glow that reflects on the water's surface. The video begins with a wide shot of the corridor, capturing the full, empty expanse that culminates in a distant doorway and steps. Instead of a slow reveal, the camera quickly pans across the scene, emphasizing the eerie and isolating atmosphere of the environment. The composition and dynamic camera movement are designed to evoke a sense of unease, making the space itself the central point of interest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low perspective at water level, the scene unfolds within a long, narrow indoor channel filled with dark, murky green water. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in a grid of small, pale green tiles. Rows of bright, square lights are recessed into the ceiling, illuminating the sterile environment and reflecting off the wet surfaces. The camera quickly pans to the right from a dark, arched opening partially submerged in the water, revealing the extended length of the corridor. At the far end, a brighter area contains a doorway and steps leading up from the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This scenery video presents a wide shot from a low, water-level perspective. The shot begins focused on a dark, arched opening in the bottom left foreground, which is partially submerged in the water that occupies the lower portion of the frame. The camera then pans to the right and tilts slightly upward, moving the opening off-screen to the left. This action reveals the full length of a narrow, tiled corridor that extends from the foreground into the background. In the final frame, the water remains at the bottom, a tiled wall is on the left, and the ceiling with rows of lights is visible at the top, leading to a distant doorway and steps in the background.",
