    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a serene park setting, beginning with a focus on the road beside the green path. As the camera smoothly pans to the right, the emphasis transitions to the expansive green lawn, dotted with a few bare trees, effectively suggesting a late autumn or early spring atmosphere. The golden sunlight casts long shadows, adding depth and warmth to the scene. In the background, passing vehicles and a few buildings are visible, but they remain secondary to the natural elements, highlighting the tranquil environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene depicts an outdoor urban park setting during the late afternoon, with sunlight casting long shadows across the grassy area. The grass is lush and green, interspersed with a few bare trees, indicating a season of early spring or late autumn. In the background, a road with light traffic is visible, featuring a few cars and a pedestrian crossing. The buildings beyond the road are residential, with brick facades and pitched roofs. The sky is mostly clear with a few scattered clouds, contributing to the warm, golden light that enhances the scene's tranquil atmosphere. The overall environment is calm, with a mix of natural and urban elements harmoniously coexisting.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a park, focusing on the road beside a green path. The road is positioned in the middle ground, running horizontally across the frame, with vehicles visible in the background. As the camera pans smoothly to the right, the emphasis shifts to the expansive green lawn, which occupies the foreground and middle ground. The lawn is dotted with a few bare trees, positioned in the top left and right of the frame, suggesting a late autumn or early spring setting. The golden sunlight casts long shadows from the trees and other elements, adding depth to the scene. In the background, buildings and passing vehicles remain visible but secondary, maintaining the focus on the natural elements. The camera is positioned at a height that captures the scene from a slightly elevated angle, providing a comprehensive view of both the park and the urban elements beyond.",
