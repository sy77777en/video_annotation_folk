    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An over-the-shoulder shot shows the back of a person's shoulder and head. The person is wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt. In the distance, a light illuminates a dark forest of bare trees, revealing a single, light-colored shoe with a dark sole hanging from a tree branch.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An over-the-shoulder POV, where the camera is positioned behind a character wearing a blue hooded garment, shows the scene ahead. The view is into a dense forest at night, where a focused beam of light cuts through the darkness to illuminate a small area. The light reveals numerous tall, slender, and bare tree trunks rising from a ground covered in dry, brown leaves and underbrush. In the center of the illuminated patch, a small, grey and black shoe is visible hanging partway up one of the tree trunks.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: It is an over-the-shoulder shot showing part of a person's shoulder and the right side of their neck as they use a smartphone in the frame's left corner. Ahead, a dark forest is visible with a small shoe hanging from a tree.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static over-the-shoulder shot. In the foreground, the shoulder and side of a person's head occupy the left portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at their shoulder height, looking forward into the middle ground and background, which consists of a dark forest. A focused light source illuminates the center of the frame, revealing a shoe hanging from a tree in the middle ground, surrounded by other bare tree trunks.",
