    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a stark white room, a man wearing a red top hat and a white jumpsuit with a red stripe stands with one foot on a small white platform and the other foot on the step of a small staircase beside the platform, with his right hand on a cane. Nearby, several other people are dressed in identical white jumpsuits with red stripes, all wearing the white hoods from their suits. Two individuals stand and move near the center of the frame, with their arms slightly outstretched, sometimes pointing a finger upwards. To the left, two figures in white hoods stand on the platform, with one visible in front of a white structure, facing away from the camera. In the background, more figures in white are gathered around a white table. Floating above them all is a large, dense cloud of tiny, dark, and reddish-colored particles suspended against the white wall.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a stark, all-white room with a minimalist aesthetic. The walls, floor, and various geometric platforms are uniformly white. Suspended in the air above is a dense, static-like cloud composed of thousands of tiny black, red, and yellow particles. On the left side of the room, a white pedestal supports a black machine, and a small, two-step platform is positioned nearby. On the right, a low, circular white platform rests on the floor, with more indistinct white furniture visible in the distant background. The entire space is brightly and evenly lit.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot filmed at the subjects' level, a man in a top hat stands in the left middle ground on a small white staircase. To his right, another figure stands on the same platform, while a third is positioned further left, partially behind a white structure. In the center of the frame and the middle ground, two figures gesture, with one pointing a finger upward toward a large, dense cloud of dark particles suspended across the top of the frame in the background. A low, circular platform occupies the right foreground, and in the distant background on the right, several other figures are gathered around a table. The central figures exhibit slight body and arm movements, while the other subjects remain relatively stationary.",
