    "pre_caption": "A medium shot, taken from a selfie perspective, features a woman in a blue shirt positioned in the foreground at the center of the frame. Flanking her in the middle ground are two other women: one in a pink and red shirt on the left and another in a white shirt on the right. Both are positioned slightly behind the central woman. The white rooftop they are on occupies the middle ground, with a cityscape visible in the background. The camera is held at the subjects' level, and the framing remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned woman with short, curly, bright orange hair is in the center, holding the camera for a selfie. She wears a bright blue, short-sleeved button-up shirt and green rectangular sunglasses. To the left of the frame stands a light-brown-skinned woman with dark, curly, shoulder-length hair, who is smiling. She is dressed in a pink and red patterned long-sleeved shirt and yellow cat-eye sunglasses. To the right of the central woman is another light-brown-skinned woman with long, dark hair pulled back. She wears a white t-shirt, blue earrings, and yellow-brown sunglasses, posing with one hand on her head. Both women on the left and right are positioned slightly behind the woman in the center.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed, captures three people on a white, textured rooftop under a clear, bright blue sky during the day. In the background, a cityscape with numerous buildings of varying heights and architectural styles is visible. The person in the center, wearing a blue shirt and green sunglasses, holds the camera, while two others pose on either side. The scene is brightly lit by direct sunlight.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
