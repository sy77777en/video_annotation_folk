    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From the perspective of a backward-facing, head-mounted camera, the video shows a wingsuit flyer in mid-air. The flyer's back, shoulders, and spread arms occupy the lower portion of the view. They are wearing a black and bright yellow wingsuit with light blue trim. A black parachute pack or harness, also featuring light blue accents and a blue patch on the upper back, is strapped to the flyer.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, mounted to a person in a black and yellow wingsuit, shows a flight through a mountain range during the day. A sheer, textured rock cliff dominates the right side of the view, rising towards a blue sky filled with white, puffy clouds. In the distance on the left, another rocky mountain range is visible. The perspective remains fixed to the person as they move alongside the cliff face.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video, captured with a head-mounted camera, shows a wingsuit flyer in mid-air. The camera is facing backward, with only the subject\u2019s arms and part of their back visible in the lower half of the frame, while the rest of the frame shows the surroundings.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This video, captured with a head-mounted camera facing backward, frames the wingsuit flyer's back and spread arms in the foreground, occupying the bottom half of the screen. A large, sheer rock cliff is positioned in the middle ground, dominating the right side of the frame. The sky, filled with clouds, occupies the top and top-left portions of the frame in the background. In the far background, another mountain range is visible in the bottom-left corner. The camera remains at the subject's level and fixed in position relative to them. As the flyer moves forward, the cliff in the middle ground appears to travel past them, moving from the top right towards the bottom of the frame, while the background elements recede.",
