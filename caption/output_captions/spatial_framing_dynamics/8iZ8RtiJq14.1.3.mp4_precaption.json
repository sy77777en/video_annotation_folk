    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A beige, vintage-style digital office telephone rests on a wooden surface. The phone features a numeric keypad, a coiled cord, and a small, green, backlit LCD screen displaying the vertical text \"CALL 95242046\". Next to the phone is a round, silver-colored metal ashtray, which holds a single cigarette with a yellow filter in one of its notches.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A beige, vintage-style digital office phone sits on a wooden desk. The phone features a numeric keypad, several function buttons, and a coiled cord connecting the handset to the base. A small, green-backlit screen on the phone horizontally displays the word \"CALL\" next to the number \"95242046\". To the right of the phone, a silver metal ashtray holds a single cigarette with a yellow filter.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "A high-angle full shot frames a vintage digital phone and an ashtray on a wooden surface. The phone is positioned slightly left of the center in the middle ground. In the bottom right foreground, a silver ashtray holds a single cigarette. The entire scene is captured from a static, tilted overhead perspective.",
