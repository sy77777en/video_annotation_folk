    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a top-down aerial cityscape scenery shot at night, capturing the sprawling urban environment from a high vantage point. The scene is dominated by the dark silhouettes of skyscrapers and the glowing grid of streets below, where the headlights and taillights of cars create streams of moving light. One building features a brightly lit roof with a distinct pattern of lights, while another towering skyscraper is illuminated from below, its structured, lit spire becoming increasingly prominent. There is no main subject, as the camera's detached, bird's-eye perspective emphasizes the vast scale and intricate patterns of the metropolis, focusing on the overall atmosphere of the nocturnal city rather than any individual element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a top-down perspective of a dense city at night. The dark silhouettes of skyscrapers are visible against the black sky, with streets forming a grid below. The streets are active with the white headlights of moving vehicles. One building has a rooftop outlined by a pattern of warm, glowing lights. As the view shifts, a powerful, cool-toned light emanates from the bottom of a tall skyscraper, creating a bright flare that illuminates the immediate vicinity.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a high-angle, top-down perspective. Initially, the frame is centered on a city block at night, with a building featuring a brightly lit roof occupying the top center. Darker buildings are positioned on the left and right, while a grid of streets with moving car lights fills the lower portion of the frame. The camera then slowly pulls back, revealing more of the cityscape. As it moves, a tall skyscraper enters the frame from the bottom right, accompanied by a powerful, bright light source at its base that creates a prominent flare in the bottom right quadrant. By the end of the shot, the frame encompasses a wider view, with the initial lit-roof building in the top half and the newly revealed, illuminated skyscraper occupying the bottom right.",
