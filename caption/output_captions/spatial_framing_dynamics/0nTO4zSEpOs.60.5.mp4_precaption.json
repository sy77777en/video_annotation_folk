    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a bustling urban scene at night, featuring a modern cityscape with illuminated skyscrapers and digital billboards. In the foreground, pedestrians are visible on a walkway. The background showcases a busy street with several buses and cars, highlighting the vibrant city life. The overall atmosphere is lively, with the bright lights of the buildings contrasting against the night sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a bustling urban environment at night, set in a vibrant cityscape with towering buildings adorned with bright advertisements and digital billboards. The setting is outdoors, featuring a modern pedestrian walkway elevated above a busy street filled with traffic, including buses and cars. The scene is illuminated by artificial lights from the surrounding skyscrapers, creating a lively atmosphere. Notable architectural features include a mix of contemporary high-rises and commercial structures, with a prominent building labeled \"Tokyo Plaza.\" The pedestrian walkway features white light tubes on the railings, illuminating the ground. It is paved with light-colored tiles and has railings made of metal and glass. Pedestrians, some wearing coats, walk along the walkway, adding a sense of motion and activity. Overlay elements include text at the bottom left corner, reading \"Virtual Japan,\" which is not part of the scene itself.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban scene at night, capturing a broad view of the cityscape. Initially, pedestrians occupy the foreground, positioned on a well-lit pedestrian walkway that spans horizontally across the frame. These individuals are seen walking from left to right, situated in the middle ground of the scene. As the video progresses, the camera pans to the right, gradually shifting the focus from the walkway to the busy street below. This transition reveals more of the background, where numerous vehicles, including buses and cars, move along the street. The buildings, prominently featuring digital billboards and illuminated signs, dominate the upper portion of the frame, extending into the background. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned slightly above the walkway level, providing a clear view of both the pedestrians and the street below. The spatial arrangement shifts from a closer perspective of the walkway and its occupants to a broader view of the entire urban landscape, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between the pedestrian movement and the bustling street activity.",
