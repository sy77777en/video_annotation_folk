    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person on an ascending escalator, viewed from behind. The person, whose upper body is visible from above the chest, occupies half the height of the frame. They have shoulder-length, light-colored hair and are wearing a dark jacket. The camera captures the person centrally, emphasizing their presence while also showing the surrounding escalator and tiled walls. The setting suggests an indoor environment, likely a subway or shopping center, with fluorescent lighting reflecting off the surfaces.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting within a subway station, featuring an escalator leading upwards. The environment is characterized by tiled walls and a metallic ceiling, both reflecting the fluorescent lighting that casts a cool, sterile glow. The escalator, with its dark, moving steps, contrasts with the lighter surroundings. The scene is devoid of natural light, suggesting it takes place underground. The setting is clean and modern, with a sense of symmetry created by the parallel lines of the walls and ceiling. The overall atmosphere is quiet and functional, typical of a transit space.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an escalator scene, with the camera positioned on an ascending escalator, filming from behind a person. Only the person's upper body above the chest is visible, taking up half the height of the frame, leaving more content for the surroundings.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video employs a medium shot, focusing on a person seen from behind, whose upper body from the chest up occupies the central foreground and about half the frame's height. The ascending escalator extends from the bottom center foreground diagonally upwards towards the top center background. Tiled walls flank the escalator on the left and right sides of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the background. The reflective ceiling fills the top portion of the frame, extending from the foreground towards the background, where fluorescent lights are visible. The entire frame, including the person and camera, moves steadily upwards with the escalator, causing the background elements to gradually approach. The camera is positioned level with the subject.",
