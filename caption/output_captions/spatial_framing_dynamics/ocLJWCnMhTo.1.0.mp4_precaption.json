    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man wearing a light-colored short-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and black shoes appears to be suspended above stools on a black-and-white checkered floor. His arms are raised with his hands open. Throughout the grainy video, bright, swirling orange lines of light move erratically around and over his body. The camera's perspective changes, shifting from a side view to a high-angle, top-down shot of the man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a room with a black and white checkered tile floor and light-colored, grainy walls. A person wearing a light-colored shirt is lying flat on their back, suspended above silver stools in the center of the room. In the background, there is a light blue rectangular board against the wall next to a white door, along with two metal chairs and a round table against the back wall. The camera angle shifts from a straight-on view to a higher, downward-tilted perspective. An overlay of thin, glowing, orange, serpentine lines continuously swirls and moves across the entire scene, passing over the room and the person. The video has a grainy, low-resolution quality.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, positioning a man in the center-left of the frame and in the middle ground, with the camera at his level. Swirling orange lines of light move through the foreground and middle ground, while the room's walls and a door are visible in the background. The camera then moves upward and tilts down, transitioning to a high-angle full shot. In this final framing, the man is centered on the checkered floor in the middle ground, with the floor itself occupying the foreground and background. The orange lines continue to move across the entire scene throughout the shot.",
