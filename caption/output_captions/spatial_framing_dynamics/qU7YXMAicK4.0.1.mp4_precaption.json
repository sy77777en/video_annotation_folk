    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small plant seedling with two large, heart-shaped green leaves is shown growing. The surfaces of the leaves feature a distinct silvery-white mottled pattern. The seedling, which has a single thin stem, is planted in dark soil inside a bright purple, cylindrical plastic pot with a flared rim. The pot is positioned inside a light-colored wooden box. The leaves of the plant unfurl, expand, and change their orientation over time.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse video shows a small seedling in a purple plastic pot, set inside a box made of light-colored wood. The seedling has a single stem and two large, heart-shaped green leaves with a distinct silvery, mottled pattern. The pot is filled with dark soil. Throughout the sequence, the lighting transitions between various types, including a spotlight from above that illuminates the plant and the wooden surface below, as well as a brighter, more diffuse light. The plant's leaves can be seen subtly moving and extending outward over time. The entire scene is framed by solid green vertical bars on the left and right sides of the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "A full shot frames a purple pot containing a small plant seedling, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The pot is situated inside a light-colored wooden box that forms the background. The entire scene is flanked by solid green vertical bars on the left and right sides of the frame. The camera is positioned above the subject, looking down at the plant. Throughout the time-lapse, the plant's two leaves, initially somewhat curled, unfurl and expand horizontally, spreading out towards the left and right sides of the central frame while the pot and camera remain stationary.",
