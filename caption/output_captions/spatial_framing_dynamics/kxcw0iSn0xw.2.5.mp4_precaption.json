    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man's light-skinned hands hold two launchers that are spinning a pair of tops on a wooden surface. The top on the left is covered in red and yellow paint, while the top on the right has pink and blue paint. As the tops spin, the liquid paint swirls and is flung outwards, creating thin, arcing streams of color that splatter onto the surface, forming a web-like pattern. The colors on each top begin to mix, and the splattered lines of red, yellow, pink, and blue intersect around the spinning objects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot, positioned directly above for a top-down perspective, captures an action on a light brown wooden surface. A pair of hands launches two spinning tops, one covered in red and yellow paint and the other in pink and blue paint. As the tops rotate rapidly, the wet paint is flung outwards, creating thin, arcing lines and splatters. The colors mix and spread, forming an intricate, web-like pattern of intersecting spirals on the wooden background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a close-up, overhead shot, a man's hands are positioned at the top center of the frame, holding two spinning tops side-by-side in the center. The top on the left has red and yellow paint, while the top on the right has pink and blue paint, all set against a wooden surface that fills the background. As the tops rotate in place, the paint is flung outwards from the center in thin, arcing streams. These streams create an expanding, web-like pattern of intersecting spirals on the surrounding wooden surface, while the hands and tops remain fixed in their central positions.",
