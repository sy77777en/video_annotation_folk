    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Large, dark blue Chinese characters, \"\u5fd7\u5b58\u9ad8\u8fdc,\" are painted directly onto a light-colored wall, flanking a central circular logo. This logo features a stylized, mountain-like \"M\" shape and is inscribed with the English text \"NO. 2 SHIYAN HIGH SCHOOL\" along its upper edge and smaller Chinese characters along the bottom. In the foreground, the dark silhouettes of two people are visible from behind at the bottom of the frame. Both have black hair; the first person has short hair, while the second person has longer hair. They are walking underneath the characters and logo, appearing to look up at it as they do so.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, looking up at a plain, light-colored wall under cool, artificial lighting. Centered on the wall is a dark blue circular logo containing a stylized mountain-like emblem and the English words \"NO. 2 SHIYAN HIGH SCHOOL\" along its upper curve. Flanking the logo are large, dark blue Chinese characters. The view is partially obscured from below by the dark silhouettes of two people's heads looking up towards the signage.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
