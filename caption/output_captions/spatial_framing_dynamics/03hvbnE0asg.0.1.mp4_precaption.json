    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, viewed from a low angle, is wearing an orange, ribbed spacesuit with a green helmet that has a clear visor. A yellow, box-like apparatus is attached to the front of the suit at chest level, connected by black straps. The person wears green gloves and interacts with a wall panel covered in protruding navy components with green and yellow buttons.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, within a room featuring white walls and large, angled, segmented windows that admit a pale, slightly pinkish light. Portions of the walls are adorned with panels of small, protruding rectangular blocks colored navy, yellow, and green. A figure clad in an orange spacesuit, complete with a helmet and a yellow chest-mounted device, moves within this space, interacting with the textured wall panels.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium full shot, with a person in a spacesuit initially centered in the foreground. To their right, in the middle ground, is a wall panel with various components. Large, angled windows are visible in the background at the top of the frame, and other wall panels are on the left in the middle ground. The person, initially interacting with the right-hand wall panel, turns their body to the left. As they turn, they shift slightly towards the left side of the frame, remaining in the foreground. Consequently, the right-hand wall panel moves further to the right and recedes slightly, while the left-hand wall panels become more prominent in the middle ground. The windows remain in the background at the top. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
