    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents an aerial scenery shot of an airport at night. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere, highlighting the illuminated runways, taxiways, and terminal building against the dark surroundings, rather than a specific object. The runways and taxiways are outlined with green and white lights, creating a distinct pattern, while the central terminal complex is brightly lit, showcasing its structure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a nighttime aerial view of an airport. The scene is dark, with the airport layout illuminated by lights. Runways and taxiways are clearly defined by continuous green edge lighting and dotted white centerline lights. A central terminal complex, appearing somewhat circular or star-shaped, is brightly lit with white lights. The surrounding area is very dark, suggesting undeveloped land or water.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a scenery shot. It presents an extreme wide shot of an airport at night, captured from an aerial perspective looking down. The illuminated airport layout, featuring runways and taxiways, occupies the majority of the frame, extending from the bottom foreground towards the top middle ground. The main runways are oriented vertically, running from the bottom towards the center of the frame, while intersecting taxiways and another runway extend horizontally across the middle ground. The brightly lit terminal complex is positioned in the top left quadrant, situated in the middle ground. The surrounding dark area, representing undeveloped land or water, fills the background and the periphery of the frame.",
