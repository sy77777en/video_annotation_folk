    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a vibrant cityscape, showcasing a lively street in a Japanese city. The focus is on conveying the bustling atmosphere and detailed environment of the urban setting, with no single main subject. The narrow, paved street is lined with multi-story buildings adorned with glowing signs in both Japanese and English, enhancing the multicultural atmosphere. On the right, a brightly lit arcade with signs reading \"TOY'S CATCHER AND GAME\" and \"AMUFUN\" draws the eye, its open front revealing numerous claw machines. Pedestrians, including two young women in dresses and face masks, walk along the street, contributing to the dynamic energy of the scene in the late afternoon light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A view down a narrow, paved street in a Japanese city shows a commercial area at dusk. Multi-story buildings with a variety of colorful signs in both Japanese and English line the street. On the right, a brightly lit arcade with a sign reading \"TOY'S CATCHER AND GAME\" has an open front, revealing numerous claw machines filled with plush toys. The entrance is framed by red and green neon lights, and an \"AMUFUN\" sign is also visible. On the left, a pink \"SUPER ANGEL\" sign is mounted on a building. Several pedestrians, including two young women in dresses and face masks, walk along the street as the artificial lights of the storefronts begin to illuminate the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, eye-level shot of a narrow city street. The street itself occupies the lower half of the frame, leading from the foreground into the background. Buildings line the left and right sides of the frame in the middle ground. Initially, two women are positioned in the right foreground, walking away from the camera, while an arcade is visible in the right middle ground. The camera then moves forward and pans slightly to the right. As it advances, the two women exit the frame on the right, and the arcade moves from the right middle ground to become the central focus in the foreground, revealing its interior.",
