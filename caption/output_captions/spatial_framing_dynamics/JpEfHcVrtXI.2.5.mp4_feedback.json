    "pre_caption": "In a wide, high-angle shot, a motorbike rider is initially positioned in the center middle ground at the top of a staircase, with the sharp, pink branches of a tree framing the scene from the foreground. The number \"3021\" is overlaid in the top left of the frame. The camera then pulls back as a second motorbike rider enters from the bottom of the frame, becoming the new central subject. The camera proceeds to follow this new rider from a high angle, keeping them in the lower center of the frame as they drive forward along a road that recedes into the background. As the rider moves forward, the first rider becomes a distant figure in the background, while stylized buildings and trees scroll past in the middle ground on the left and right sides of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A motorbike rider wearing a green shirt and a dark helmet is depicted riding a purple motorcycle. As the camera moves backward, it follows another motorbike rider wearing a pink outfit and a dark helmet, riding a pink motorcycle. Both motorcycles have white wheels. The scene includes large, pink, angular hearts on the road and the numbers \"3021\" displayed in a large, pink, digital-style font in the upper left. In the foreground, the bare branches of a tree are rendered as sharp, angular, pink lines.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the perspective follows a motorcycle moving along a dark street at night. The stylized urban landscape is rendered with a limited color palette of deep purples, vibrant pinks, and cyan accents. Dark, geometric buildings with glowing windows and pointed arches line the road, which features a single section marked with a white crosswalk. The path includes occasional staircases that the motorcycle descends. In the foreground and along the street, bare, angular trees with glowing pink branches are visible. An overlay in the upper left corner displays a changing number, similar to a score, starting at \"3021\" in a glowing pink, digital-style font.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
