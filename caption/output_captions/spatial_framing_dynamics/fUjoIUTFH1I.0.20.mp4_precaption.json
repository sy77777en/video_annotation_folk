    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases an apartment building in a small town setting, highlighting the architectural details and atmosphere of the area. The focus is on capturing the essence and character of the location, providing context and immersing the viewer in the environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor urban street scene, likely in a historic district. The setting features a row of buildings with distinct architectural elements, such as wrought iron balconies adorned with hanging plants. The buildings are connected by a brick wall, and they have large, white-framed windows and doors. A standard-width sidewalk runs alongside the street, where a person is seen walking. A vehicle with a visible paw print decal is parked nearby. The time of day appears to be overcast, contributing to a muted color palette dominated by earthy tones and the greenery of the plants. The scene conveys a sense of quiet urban life, with minimal movement and a focus on the architectural details.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide, static shot captures an urban street scene. A row of buildings with prominent balconies occupies the middle ground, extending across the upper two-thirds of the frame from left to right. In the foreground, a sidewalk stretches horizontally, with the street occupying the bottom right. A white vehicle is partially visible, parked in the right foreground. Although this is a scenery shot, a person is briefly seen walking from the center towards the left along the sidewalk in the bottom left of the frame. The camera is positioned at street level, looking straight on at the ground floor and slightly up towards the balconies.",
