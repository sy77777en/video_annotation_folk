    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases an apartment building in a small town setting, highlighting the architectural details and atmosphere of the area. The focus is on capturing the essence and character of the location, providing context and immersing the viewer in the environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor urban street scene, likely in a historic district. The setting features a row of buildings with distinct architectural elements, such as wrought iron balconies adorned with hanging plants. The buildings are connected by a brick wall, and they have large, white-framed windows and doors. A standard-width sidewalk runs alongside the street, where a person is seen walking. A vehicle with a visible paw print decal is parked nearby. The time of day appears to be overcast, contributing to a muted color palette dominated by earthy tones and the greenery of the plants. The scene conveys a sense of quiet urban life, with minimal movement and a focus on the architectural details.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban street scene, capturing the full breadth of the architecture and surroundings. The buildings occupy the majority of the frame, extending from the left to the right side, forming the central focus in the middle ground. The wrought iron balconies with hanging plants are prominently displayed along the upper portion of the frame, while the white-framed windows and doors are situated in the lower half. The brick wall connecting the buildings is visible in the background, adding depth to the scene. The sidewalk runs horizontally across the bottom of the frame, with a vehicle featuring a paw print decal parked on the far right side in the foreground. The camera remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective at eye level relative to the buildings. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning, preserving the initial wide view and the arrangement of elements within the frame.",
