    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An empty, clear glass tumbler stands in the center, positioned between two people. The glass is cylindrical with a wider mouth and a slight curve near its base, and it reflects distorted vertical white shapes. Flanking the glass are two individuals, one on the left and one on the right, both wearing white, full-body protective suits with the hoods pulled up. Their faces are obscured by blue masks. Only the upper torsos and heads of the two figures are visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a setting with a solid black background, a clear, empty drinking glass rests on a dark surface. The camera pulls back from a blurry close-up to reveal the full glass, which is flanked by two out-of-focus figures wearing white, full-body protective suits. The scene is brightly lit, causing reflections on the glass. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the number \"(27)\". **\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an extreme close-up, out-of-focus shot of a clear glass tumbler positioned in the center of the frame. The camera then pulls back, transitioning to a medium shot and bringing the glass into sharp focus. In the final framing, the glass remains in the center middle ground, flanked by two out-of-focus figures in white protective suits. One figure is on the left and the other is on the right, both situated in the middle ground against a solid black background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
