    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a close-up profile view of a Black man's head and shoulders against a dark background. He has short, dark hair and is wearing a light-colored shirt. The lighting is dim, illuminating only the left side of his face and head, leaving the right side mostly in shadow. His mouth is slightly open, and he is looking towards the left side of the frame while running.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set in an extremely dark environment where the surroundings are indistinguishable, suggesting it is nighttime or within a space completely lacking light. Only the left side of the person's face and shoulder are visible, heavily shadowed and appearing mostly as a silhouette against the pervasive darkness. As the person runs, their arms swing up and down, and occasionally their hands can also be seen. No other details of the location are discernible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot frames a man primarily on the left side of the screen, occupying the foreground. The background is entirely dark and indistinct. The camera maintains a position level with the subject. While the man is running, causing slight vertical motion, his position remains fixed on the left side of the frame, consistently facing left. His hands occasionally enter the frame in the bottom left foreground.",
