    "pre_caption": "The video employs an extreme wide shot from a tilted overhead angle, showing an interior scene. A primary character in a green cloak occupies the center middle ground of the main room, while a secondary character in a blue cloak is positioned in the right middle ground, within an L-shaped entryway. The main room, featuring a fireplace in its top-left background and bookshelves along its top-left and top-center background, forms the central and upper middle ground. Various UI elements are overlaid in the foreground: a minimap is on the left side, informational text is at the bottom center, a HUD with icons and status bars lines the bottom edge, and additional icons are in the bottom-left and bottom-right corners. During the clip, a red circular \"TALK\" icon appears in the foreground, superimposed over the secondary character on the right. Following this, a dialogue box and a character portrait emerge in the bottom-right foreground, covering the icons previously visible in that corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays two characters within an interior space. The primary character, positioned centrally, is clad in armor with a green cloak and is holding a bow and arrow. Another character, dressed in armor with a blue cloak, stands near a doorway to the right. Both characters' attire suggests a fantasy or historical setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows the environment in a three-quarters perspective. The scene is set indoors within a dimly lit, rectangular room featuring aged, brownish walls and a large, light-brown woven rug covering most of the floor. A prominent stone fireplace with a lit fire occupies the back wall, flanked by bookshelves filled with books. Other furniture includes a wooden table, a chair, and candlesticks providing light. An attached L-shaped entryway contains a small round wooden table, a standing candelabra, and a smaller rug. The area surrounding the visible room is entirely black. A character in a green cloak stands in the main room, holding a bow and arrow, while another character in a blue cloak is positioned in the entryway. Overlays are present: text at the bottom center indicates experience points gained and a level achieved; a Heads-Up Display (HUD) with icons and status bars occupies the bottom edge; a minimap is on the left side; and a red circular \"TALK\" icon appears over the character in the entryway during the video. In the bottom-left and bottom-right corners, icons representing skills or HP & MP appear. After clicking the \"TALK\" icon, a dialogue box and a character portrait in the bottom-right cover the bottom icons.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
