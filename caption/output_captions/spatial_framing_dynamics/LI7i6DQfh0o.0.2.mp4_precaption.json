    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person's lower legs and feet are visible, showing them wearing black leggings, white socks with green stripes, and black sneakers, as they sit on a wooden deck. To the right of them, a modern picnic set is arranged on a dark gray, rectangular placemat with white stitching. The set includes a rectangular, two-compartment metal lunchbox containing a salad with chicken and peas, cherry tomatoes, and grilled vegetables. There is also a square, orange container, with its white, orange-rimmed lid placed beside it. A white plate with a gray utensil rests on top of the orange container. The set is completed by two small, white, round containers, and a fork and spoon held together by a black elastic band on a gray holder with an orange rim. A smartphone and a small orange ring lie next to the detached lid.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor meal is set up on a weathered wooden deck. A dark gray, textured placemat with white stitching is laid out on the planks. Arranged on the mat is a modern lunch set, featuring a rectangular, metal bento box with two compartments containing a salad with chicken and peas, cherry tomatoes, and grilled vegetables. An orange, square container with a separate white lid with an orange rim, two small white circular containers, and a set of cutlery held in an orange and gray holder complete the arrangement. The lower legs and feet of a person wearing black sneakers are visible in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static, high-angle full shot of a picnic set arranged on a wooden deck. The picnic set, placed on a dark gray mat, occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground. In the center-left, an orange container is topped with a white plate. To its right, in the center-right middle ground, is a rectangular metal lunchbox, with a cutlery set to its right and two small white cups to its left. In the foreground, the container's detached white lid is in the bottom center, with a smartphone and an orange ring to its right in the bottom right. The lower legs and feet of a person are visible in the top right background.",
