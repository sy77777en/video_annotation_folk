    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot, depicting a vast, flat plain of green and yellow grass under an immense, turbulent sky. The scene is dominated by massive, dark grey storm clouds that swirl and gather, with curtains of rain visibly falling in the distance. A single, small tree stands alone in the middle of the expansive field, appearing small and isolated against the powerful backdrop. The primary focus is on the powerful, ominous atmosphere and the sheer scale of the natural environment, rather than on a specific subject, using the lone tree to emphasize the vastness of the landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A solitary green tree stands in the middle of a vast, open grassland composed of yellow and green grasses that extend to the horizon. The sky above is filled with a massive, churning formation of dark gray and black storm clouds, which have a subtle bluish-green tint in some areas. In the distance, a sheet of falling rain moves across the landscape, partially obscuring the horizon under the turbulent sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape. The bottom third of the frame is occupied by a vast grassy plain that stretches from the foreground to the background horizon. A solitary tree is positioned in the lower center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. The top two-thirds of the frame are dominated by a massive formation of dark storm clouds in the background sky. A sheet of rain is visible in the background, behind the tree, moving across the landscape. The camera is positioned at a low height, level with the plain, looking straight ahead.",
