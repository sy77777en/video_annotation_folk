    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A stylized, white ocean liner is shown from a top-down perspective on a black, textured background that resembles dark water. The scene is overlaid with a white grid and a white, rectangular frame with markings that enhance the visual structure. A compass icon is in the lower-left corner, and labels for longitude and latitude display changing numerical values. A glowing, red dashed line extends from the bow of the ship toward a small, glowing red dot. As the video progresses, a large, red dashed square forms, enclosing both the ship and the red dot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a digital representation of a dark, rippling ocean at night, a white grid overlay provides coordinates. A stylized white ship with an attached lifeboat is positioned in the lower right quadrant. A dashed red line extends from the ship's bow toward a glowing red dot in the upper left. Overlays in the corners display a compass icon and changing longitude and latitude values. A white, scaled rectangular frame surrounds the edges of the video frame. As the video progresses, a red, dashed square is drawn onto the grid, eventually enclosing the red dot and the ship.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide, top-down shot of a stylized white ship in the lower right quadrant and a glowing red dot in the upper left, both in the middle ground. A dashed red line extends diagonally between them. In the foreground, a compass icon is fixed in the bottom left corner, with coordinate displays at the top of the frame. As the shot transitions to an extreme wide shot, a large, red dashed square is drawn clockwise, starting from the left side of the frame and eventually enclosing the ship and the red dot in the center. The camera remains positioned directly above the scene throughout.",
