    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a tropical coastline. The ocean occupies the left side of the frame, with a sandy beach forming a curve between the water and a dense forest of palm trees that fills the center and right portions of the frame in the middle ground. In the background, hazy, tree-covered hills stretch across the horizon under a pale sky at the top of the frame. The camera is positioned at a high angle and glides steadily forward, moving over the tops of the palm trees. This movement causes the trees in the middle ground to pass from the bottom of the frame towards the top, continuously revealing more of the coastline and forest ahead.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot. There is no main subject because the focus is on the expansive environment and atmosphere, capturing the scale of the tropical coastline. The aerial perspective showcases the gentle waves of the ocean meeting a sandy beach, which is bordered by a dense forest of tall, green palm trees. In the distance, hazy, tree-covered hills stretch across the horizon under a pale, early morning or late afternoon sky, emphasizing the natural beauty and vastness of the location rather than a specific object or entity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone glides forward over a vast tropical coastline during the early morning or late afternoon. On the left, the calm ocean meets a wide, sandy beach that curves into the distance, with gentle waves creating lines of white surf. Adjacent to the beach, a dense forest of tall, green palm trees stretches along the shore. Further inland, the landscape rises into rolling hills covered in thick, dark green vegetation, all under a hazy, pale sky illuminated by the low sun.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
