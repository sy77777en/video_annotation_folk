    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a young, light-skinned woman, filmed from over her shoulder as she stands before a mirror. Initially, the focus is on her clear reflection, which shows her from the waist up. She is wearing a simple, short-sleeved gray t-shirt and has long, light brown hair pulled back from her face. She holds a light blue spray can with a white cap and wears two black bracelets on her left wrist. As she turns to her left, the focus shifts from the reflection to her physical self. Now in focus, she is seen from the side, revealing her hair is styled in a high ponytail. Consequently, her reflection in the mirror becomes blurred.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, reveals from the mirror the interior of a bathroom with plain, light-colored walls. A large, frameless mirror reflects a young woman holding a light blue spray can with a white cap. In the right part of the mirror, daylight enters through a window with white vertical panes. As the character turns, white shelves cluttered with various bottles and toiletries become visible in the background.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a girl in front of a mirror, filmed over her shoulder. Initially, the reflection of the girl in the mirror is clear, showing her upper body, while part of her shoulder and her head in the foreground are blurred. As she turns to the left, the focus shifts to her, causing her reflection in the mirror to blur.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an over-the-shoulder shot, where the back of a girl's head and shoulder are out of focus in the foreground on the right. Her clear reflection, framed in a medium shot, is positioned in the middle ground at the center-left of the frame. In the background, a window is visible in the reflection on the right. The girl then turns to her left, and as she does, the camera's focus shifts from the reflection to her physical self. She moves into the middle ground on the right side of the frame, now in focus and seen in profile. Consequently, her reflection becomes blurred and shifts to the left side of the frame, while white shelves with toiletries become visible in the background on the right. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the scene.",
