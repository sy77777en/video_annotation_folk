    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Several people are seen from behind, seated in red theater chairs and facing a stage. One man has short, graying hair and wears a dark suit jacket. A young man with fair skin, dark curly hair, and a mustache, dressed in a black turtleneck and a matching jacket, walks onto the stage. He stands behind a small table and picks up a golden-colored statuette with an abstract design that is already on the table after the audience starts to applaud. As the audience members, whose hands are briefly visible, applaud, the young man smiles slightly before walking away with his award.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an audience perspective, the scene unfolds in a dark theater looking towards a small stage framed by heavy, red velvet curtains. A circular spotlight illuminates a man in a black turtleneck and jacket who walks to a small, cloth-covered table. On the table rests a golden, stylized statuette, which he picks up as audience members in the foreground clap from their red, upholstered seats. Camera flashes from the audience direction occur periodically, shifting the scene's color from warm tones to a cool blue.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video depicts an award event. Several people are seated facing the stage, with their upper backs visible as they move out of frame while the camera trucks to the right. The award winner enters the frame, showing his upper torso, and then exits the scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot from behind two audience members in the right foreground, with the left side of the frame obscured. The camera trucks to the right, revealing a full view of a stage in the background, framed by a red curtain in the middle ground. A man, shown from the upper torso up, walks from the left side of the stage to the center background, stopping behind a small table. The framing settles with the man centered in the middle ground, illuminated by a circular spotlight, while the backs and clapping hands of the audience are visible in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. After a moment, the man picks up a statuette from the table and walks off-screen to the right.",
