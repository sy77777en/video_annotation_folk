    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a medium-sized animal with reddish-brown fur, a long bushy tail, and a dark face with distinctive white markings moving through a grassy area with scattered plants and wooden structures. The animal, which appears to be a red panda based on its distinctive coloration and tail, climbs along a large fallen branch and then continues moving until it disappears from view behind foliage and structures.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors in a well-maintained, enclosed garden area with a variety of green plants, small trees, and patches of grass. The ground is a mix of grass, soil, and some worn paths, with several large, natural-looking logs placed horizontally across the space. Metal structures with vertical and horizontal bars, painted dark brown or black, are positioned throughout the area, some forming climbing frames and others supporting platforms with wooden steps and surfaces. The background includes a tall stone wall, metal fencing, and sections of light-colored paneling, indicating the perimeter of the enclosure. The lighting is bright and even, suggesting daytime with clear weather. No overlays such as text or icons are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot that captures a large portion of the enclosed garden area from an elevated camera angle above the main subject. The medium-sized animal is positioned near the center of the frame in the middle ground, moving from the left-center toward the right-center along a large fallen branch that runs diagonally through the scene. The animal remains in the middle ground as it moves, while metal climbing structures with vertical and horizontal bars are visible in the foreground and middle ground, mostly on the left and right sides of the frame. Green plants, small trees, and patches of grass fill the background and middle ground, with a tall stone wall and metal fencing forming the background along the top edge of the frame. As the animal continues moving to the right, it passes behind foliage and wooden structures, eventually disappearing from view behind these elements. Throughout the video, the camera maintains its elevated position above the subject, looking down at the scene, and does not change height or angle.",
