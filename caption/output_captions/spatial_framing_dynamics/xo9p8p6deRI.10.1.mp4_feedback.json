    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle full shot, a white SUV is positioned in the center-right foreground. Directly behind it in the middle ground, a white sedan is located in the center-left of the frame. Further back, another sedan is parked in the top-left background. A house occupies the right side of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, while trees are visible on the left and in the background.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a monochromatic scene with three cars, focusing primarily on the car closest to the house. This car, a boxy SUV with a distinct front grille and visible side mirrors, is parked nearest to a house with a porch. Behind it, a sedan with a similar boxy design is aligned in the driveway. The third car, also a sedan, is parked perpendicular to the other two on the street, rather than in the driveway. All cars are uniformly colored in a light shade, lacking distinct markings or details. The setting includes a house with visible steps and a window, and trees are present, casting shadows on the ground. The arrangement suggests a driveway or parking area, with the first two cars aligned in a row leading towards the house, while the third car is positioned on the street.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor suburban setting during the day, characterized by a monochromatic color scheme. The scene features a driveway leading to a house with a porch and steps. Two vehicles, a larger SUV and a smaller car, are parked on the driveway. The vehicles and the house are rendered in a uniform, light gray color, lacking detailed textures. Trees with simple foliage are present, casting soft shadows on the ground. The environment is calm, with no visible weather effects. Overlay elements include subtitles at the bottom center of the scene, initially displaying \"[...]\" in yellow text, then changing to \"Don't do it O.J.!\" before reverting back to \"[...]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
