    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a raised, square platform in the center of a paved area, functioning as a small putting green covered in green artificial turf, with its base draped in a black tarp. A red and white striped flagstick, topped with a small red flag marked with a white number \"1,\" is positioned near a hole on the green, with a single white golf ball nearby. As the camera positions change, the platform shifts from the center to the center-right and eventually to the far right. The golf ball moves and eventually drops into the hole, disappearing from view. Initially, a low blue fabric screen stands directly opposite the camera at the edge of the green but later appears closer to the left edge. The wooden A-frame contraption, which holds a horizontal, reflective cylinder, starts directly behind the platform but later appears to the left of it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds on a large, paved concrete expanse under a partly cloudy sky. The camera positions change frequently, causing the relative positions of the elements to shift continuously. Initially, a raised, square platform covered with green artificial turf, resembling a small putting green, is centered, but it later moves to the center-right and eventually extends to the far right. Its base is draped in black fabric. A red and white flagstick, topped with a red flag marked with the number '1', is situated near a hole on the green, with a single white golf ball nearby. The golf ball moves and eventually drops into the hole, disappearing from view. A low blue mesh screen starts directly opposite the camera at the edge of the green but later appears closer to the left edge. A long blue fence runs across the midground, with piles of dark soil visible further in the midground behind the fence. The wooden A-frame structure initially stands directly behind the platform but later appears to the left of the platform, holding a cylindrical, metallic object.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot from an elevated perspective, positioning a square putting green in the center foreground. A flagstick and a golf ball are located on the green. A wooden A-frame contraption is in the middle ground to the left, with a low blue screen directly behind the green. A long blue fence extends across the middle ground, and piles of soil are visible in the background on the left. The camera then zooms in and moves, shifting the composition to a medium shot. This causes the putting green to move from the center to the center-right and eventually to the right side of the frame. Concurrently, the wooden contraption shifts to the far left of the frame. As the framing changes, the golf ball rolls across the green and drops into the hole.",
