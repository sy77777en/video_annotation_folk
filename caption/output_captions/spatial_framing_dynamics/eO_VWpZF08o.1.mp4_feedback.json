    "pre_caption": "This medium shot initially frames a shirtless man from the thighs up in the bottom center foreground, with another man standing to his right in the middle ground. In the background, a basketball hoop is positioned in the top center, in front of a large wall mural. As the shirtless man shoots the basketball, the camera pans slightly to the left. This pan brings a third man, holding a basketball, into full view in the bottom left foreground, while the man who was on the right moves out of the frame. The shooter simultaneously drifts to the bottom right foreground, and the ball travels from his position toward the background hoop. The camera remains positioned at the subjects' level throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three men on a basketball court. The central subject is a shirtless man with dark skin, a beard, and short dark hair, who is wearing black shorts with three white vertical stripes on the side. He is actively shooting a basketball toward a hoop. To his right, another man with dark skin and a beard observes the action; he is wearing a black long-sleeved shirt, dark blue shorts, and white sneakers. On the left, a third man with dark skin, dressed in a white t-shirt and dark shorts, holds a basketball and also watches the shooter.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a gymnasium with artificial lighting. A large, colorful mural depicting various athletes in green and yellow uniforms covers the dark green back wall. One painted figure wears a white jersey with the words \"MIRA COSTA\" and the number \"50\". A basketball hoop with a transparent backboard and a white frame, along with an orange rim. The court floor is marked with large, partially visible yellow letters. Three men are on the court, engaged in basketball activity.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video shows a scene of three men playing basketball, with one of them taking a shot. The top half of the frame features the basketball hoop and the surrounding scenery, while the lower half shows the players. Most of the time, only the upper part of the player taking the shot, from the thighs up, is visible, along with the full bodies of the other two players.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
