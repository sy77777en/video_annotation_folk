    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Several lines of people walk side by side on a manicured green lawn, viewed from a very low angle that focuses on their legs and feet. The person in the immediate foreground wears grey pants and white athletic shoes with a black heel counter displaying a white Under Armour logo. To the left, another person wears white pants and white shoes. The lines recede into the distance, with other individuals wearing a mix of white, grey, and dark-colored pants, and white golf shoes with dark accents. In the blurry background, some of the people appear to be wearing blue shirts.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective on a manicured green lawn, a long line of people walks in unison during a bright, sunny day. The individuals are seen from the waist down, wearing athletic trousers in shades of white, grey, and dark blue, along with golf shoes. A white shoe with a black heel and a distinct logo is prominent in the foreground. The bright light casts long, dark shadows of the walking figures onto the vibrant green turf as the procession moves across the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a low-angle close-up shot, the legs and feet of a person are positioned in the bottom left foreground, with one shoe featuring a prominent logo. To their right and receding into the background, multiple lines of people's lower bodies walk in unison across the frame from right to left. The entire group is situated on a green lawn that occupies the bottom portion of the frame, with their movement casting long shadows toward the left.",
