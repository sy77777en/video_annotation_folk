    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a sunlit Japanese street scene. On the left side, in the middle ground, a food stall is active with customers and staff, while a woman in a red jacket walks from the left towards the right within this area. In the center foreground, a woman in black clothing with a white face mask initially faces left, then turns and walks towards the right foreground. A multi-directional signpost is positioned in the center-left middle ground, slightly behind and to the left of the woman in black. Stone and wooden pillars are visible in the center-right foreground. On the right side, in the middle ground, another food stall is seen, with several women in traditional kimonos standing in front of it; a pole with a solar panel is also visible in this right middle ground area, further to the right. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk in the far right middle ground and background, where a red car also approaches from the background. Buildings line the background of the scene. The camera maintains an objective, eye-level viewpoint.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This outdoor street scene features several pedestrians and several open-fronted food stalls. Among the pedestrians, some wear casual contemporary clothing, including a middle-aged woman in a red jacket and glasses on the left side of the frame, and a middle-aged woman in black clothing with a white face mask in the center. In front of the stall on the left, two masked customers are interacting with a masked staff member inside the stall. On the right side of the frame, several women are dressed in traditional Japanese kimonos, such as an individual in a light purple kimono holding white flowers. Additionally, on the far right side of the frame, several pedestrians are walking along the roadside, and a red car is approaching the camera. The food stalls have Japanese signage and display various items. A prominent multi-directional signpost is also visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An objective POV shot captures a sunlit street scene in Japan, where pedestrians walk along a paved sidewalk. On the left, a food stall with a green and white striped awning and a menu board displays various items. To the right, another shop with a sign featuring \"\u30c1\u30fc\u30ba\u30ab\u30c4\" (cheese katsu) in orange lettering is visible. Near the street corner, a prominent white directional sign with black and red Japanese and English text points to locations such as \"Chikurin-no-komichi\" (Bamboo Forest Path) and \"Nonomiya Shrine,\" indicating distances. This sign is positioned to the left of a stone pillar inscribed with \"\u5357\u5929\u9f8d\u5bfa\u304b\u3089\" and a wooden pillar with indistinct lettering. Several individuals are present, some in contemporary attire and others in traditional Japanese kimonos, one of which is a light purple color. The buildings feature traditional Japanese tiled roofs and wooden elements. Small stone markers and a pole with a solar panel are also visible along the street. The overall atmosphere is that of a bustling daytime commercial or tourist area.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
