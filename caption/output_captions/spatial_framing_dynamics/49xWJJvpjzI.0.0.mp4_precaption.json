    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video shows a chaotic battle scene involving two men fighting a horde of monstrous creatures in a shallow body of water. One man is clad in a sleek, black, full-body suit with glowing purple, vein-like patterns across it. The other is a man with brown hair and a beard, wearing dark, tactical-looking attire. They are surrounded by numerous aggressive, four-legged creatures with dark, greyish-red skin and multiple limbs, who are lunging and attacking them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor battle unfolds during the daytime in a shallow, churning river at the base of rolling green hills. The landscape features sandy banks, scattered rocks, and vegetation under a bright blue sky with wispy clouds. The water is disturbed by the motion of numerous figures engaged in combat. A blue, smoky energy effect emanates from the background, while one central figure wears a dark suit with glowing purple lines.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In this wide shot, a figure in a black and purple suit stands on a rock in the center-left foreground, while a second figure in dark attire is positioned in the center-right middle ground. They are surrounded by numerous creatures within a shallow river, with some in the immediate foreground and others filling the middle ground and background against a backdrop of green hills. The scene erupts with motion as the creatures are violently thrown outward from the center; one is flung toward the top left of the frame, while others are knocked back across the middle ground. The two central figures are pushed slightly backward by the force of the engagement, which churns the water around them. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the action.",
