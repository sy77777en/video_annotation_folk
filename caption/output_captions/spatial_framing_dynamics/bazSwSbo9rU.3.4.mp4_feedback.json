    "pre_caption": "This medium full shot initially frames a man from behind in the foreground center as he kicks towards another man standing in the middle ground, right of center. The man in the foreground then falls, his body landing on the floor in the bottom left foreground. This movement leaves the second man, who remains stationary, as the central focus in the middle ground, positioned to the right against a brick wall in the background. A green pipe runs horizontally across the top right of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A muscular man with short dark hair, wearing a black short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants, is the main subject. Another man, initially seen from the back wearing dark pants, attempts to kick the muscular man to the ground with both feet but ends up falling to the floor himself. The muscular man remains standing and looks down at the man on the ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit, industrial interior, characterized by an exposed brick wall on the right. A green pipe runs horizontally across the upper portion of the wall. The atmosphere is dark and hazy, with a strong, low-angle light source from the right illuminating dust particles in the air and casting deep shadows. The floor is dark and indistinct, and the overall lighting creates a stark contrast between illuminated areas and the surrounding darkness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
