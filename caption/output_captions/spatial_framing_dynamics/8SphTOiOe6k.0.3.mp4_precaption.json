    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a quiet street in a small town. The scene features traditional wooden buildings with tiled roofs lining the street, creating a harmonious blend of architecture. A few people walk along the sidewalk, adding a sense of life and movement, while cars occasionally pass by, contributing to the urban atmosphere. The sky is clear with a few clouds, and distant mountains provide a scenic backdrop, enhancing the sense of scale and environment. The focus is on the overall ambiance and charm of the town rather than any specific object, highlighting the peaceful coexistence of nature and urban life.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, capturing a serene street scene in a small town. It is daytime, with clear blue skies and scattered clouds, suggesting pleasant weather. The street is lined with traditional-style buildings featuring wooden facades and tiled roofs, evoking a quaint, historical atmosphere. On the left, a black car is parked, while a red car is seen further down the road. A group of people walks along the sidewalk on the right, dressed in casual attire. The street is clean and well-maintained, with a visible white line marking the pedestrian path. In the distance, a mountain range provides a scenic backdrop, enhancing the tranquil setting. The overall environment is calm and orderly, with a mix of natural and architectural elements contributing to the picturesque scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot capturing a serene street scene in a small town. Traditional wooden buildings with tiled roofs line both sides of the street, positioned in the middle ground and background, creating a harmonious architectural setting.

A group of people walks along the sidewalk on the right, positioned in the foreground and middle ground, adding movement to the scene. The street itself runs from the bottom to the top of the frame, with a white line marking the pedestrian path on the right. In the background, distant mountains provide a scenic backdrop, enhancing the sense of scale.
