    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up of a light brown camel adorned with colorful trappings. The camel has relatively short fur, particularly around its face and neck, and dark brown eyes. It wears a black harness with a green and white braided section across its forehead, from which a metal chain hangs. A vibrant, striped blanket with geometric patterns in yellow, red, green, blue, and white is draped over its back. Numerous colorful tassels in shades of red, blue, yellow, green, and pink hang from the blanket. A distinctive brown/black object, which is the end of the rope forming part of its harness, protrudes from its head. The camel is positioned in a rocky, mountainous setting, and its head is initially turned slightly to its right and then faces forward, presenting its right side to the camera, with its mouth closed.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a rocky, mountainous desert landscape under a clear sky, a camel is shown in a close-up view. The animal is adorned with a colorful, striped saddle blanket and a decorative bridle featuring woven green and black straps, a black tuft of hair on its forehead, and numerous hanging tassels in shades of pink, green, yellow, red, and blue on its back. The ground is a mix of sand and loose rocks, illuminated by warm sunlight. In the background, a vast expanse of arid mountains stretches into the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a camel is positioned in the center of the frame, with its head in the foreground and its body extending into the middle ground. A pile of rocks occupies the right foreground. In the background, a mountain range is visible on the right, and the back of another camel can be seen in the top left. The main camel's head, initially turned slightly to its right, rotates to face more directly forward, bringing its snout toward the center of the frame. The camera remains stationary at the camel's eye level throughout the shot.",
