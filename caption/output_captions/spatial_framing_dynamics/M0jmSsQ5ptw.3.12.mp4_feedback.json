    "pre_caption": "The video starts as an extreme wide shot, with a woman in the middle ground, positioned slightly left of center on a long blue mat that extends from the bottom foreground. A tall white wall occupies the left side of the frame, while a paved surface with yellow lines is on the right. In the background on the right, several buildings are visible. As the woman runs towards the camera, she moves from the middle ground into the foreground, causing the shot to transition into a wide shot. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A tan-skinned woman with dark hair pulled back in a white headband is shown performing an athletic maneuver. She wears a pink tank top and black capri-length leggings. While running along a blue mat, she leaps over a low, white, table-like obstacle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a vast, paved surface, possibly an airfield, under a sky with scattered white clouds. A long, narrow, dark blue mat with a textured surface and white circular markers extends away from the camera's position. To the left of the mat stands a tall, continuous wall constructed from white fabric panels. To the right, the paved area is marked with double yellow lines. In the background, several low, industrial-style buildings are visible on the flat horizon. A person in athletic attire leaps over a small, raised platform on the mat and continues running forward.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
