    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, capturing a silver car in the center middle ground. In the foreground, a green-painted surface with a white directional arrow points toward the middle ground. To the left, in the middle ground, two people are crouched near a wall, while the rear of another car is partially visible in the right middle ground. The silver car drives forward and turns right, moving into the background. A dark grey car then enters from the right middle ground, driving toward the center background and becoming the new subject of the wide shot. The camera remains static and positioned at the subjects' level throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a silver Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R driving out of a parking spot in the midground, its iconic round taillights glowing red. To the left, two people wearing dark clothing are crouched on the ground, illuminated by a bright blue light emitted from the headlights of the previous car. A dark grey Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R with white, multi-spoke wheels then enters the frame from the right, following the silver car. On the far right, the rear portion of another dark grey, wide-body car remains stationary throughout the clip.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at night on an upper level of a parking garage, possibly on an exit ramp leading to an open, dark expanse. The ground is dark asphalt, with sections painted green and marked with white directional arrows. Overhead lighting casts a greenish tint across the area. A silver sports car is moving forward and turning right, its circular red taillights illuminated. To the left, a metal staircase ascends alongside a concrete wall. Orange and white traffic cones are placed around the scene. A second, dark-colored sports car with white wheels drives into view from the right and follows the silver car. A third, dark, widebody car is partially visible, parked on the far right. In the middle ground, a green sign with Japanese characters is visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
