    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An anthropomorphic green crocodile with a long snout is in the driver's seat of an ambulance. The crocodile wears a small white medic's hat that has a red cross on the front. The vehicle is a white van with a red horizontal stripe running along its side, a red cross symbol on a side panel, and a single red and blue siren light on the roof.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a 2D animated scene, a white ambulance with a red horizontal stripe and a red cross on its side travels along a dark gray road. The vehicle, which has a red and blue siren on its roof, moves from left to right. Through the window, a green cartoon alligator wearing a small white hat with a red cross can be seen driving. The setting is outdoors during the daytime, with a background composed of stylized, light green rolling hills and simple, darker green trees with brown trunks.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, an ambulance is centered in the middle ground, with an anthropomorphic crocodile visible in the driver's seat. A road runs along the bottom of the frame in the middle ground, while stylized trees and hills make up the background. The ambulance remains stationary within the frame as the background scrolls from right to left to simulate movement. The crocodile's head and arms move slightly as it steers. The camera is positioned at the subject's height.",
