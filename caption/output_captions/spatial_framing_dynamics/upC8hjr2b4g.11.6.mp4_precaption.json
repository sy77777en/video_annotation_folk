    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a central figure, a man standing confidently with arms crossed, appearing as a 3D model uniformly colored from head to toe. He is prominently positioned in the center, illuminated by a focused light that enhances his authoritative presence. Surrounding him are several other 3D model figures, both standing and seated, uniformly colored and arranged in a semi-circle, suggesting a formal or observational setting. In the foreground, seated figures are silhouetted, facing the central man, indicating an audience or a group of observers. The monochromatic appearance, resulting from uniform coloring and lighting effects, contributes to a structured and formal atmosphere focused on the central figure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a monochromatic color scheme, primarily in shades of gray. The environment resembles a dimly lit room with a tiled floor, where several figures are positioned. In the foreground, seated figures face a group of standing figures in the background. The standing figures are mostly arranged in a line, with two figures prominently illuminated at the center; one is facing the line, while the other is positioned to the front right of the figure facing the line. The seated figures are in shadow, creating a contrast with the lit background. The room's atmosphere is subdued, with minimalistic design elements. An overlay in the bottom left corner of the video reads \"[26]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot capturing multiple subjects in a formal arrangement. The central figure, a man with arms crossed, stands prominently in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. His 2D position is central, and he is the focal point of the scene. Surrounding him, several other 3D model figures stand in a semi-circle in the background, positioned symmetrically around the central figure. These figures are evenly spaced, with some slightly to the left and right of the center. In the foreground, seated figures are silhouetted, facing the central man. They occupy the bottom portion of the frame, forming a row across the width of the image. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position during the sequence, keeping the central figure and surrounding elements stable within the frame. The overall spatial framing emphasizes the central figure's prominence while integrating the surrounding figures into a structured composition.",
