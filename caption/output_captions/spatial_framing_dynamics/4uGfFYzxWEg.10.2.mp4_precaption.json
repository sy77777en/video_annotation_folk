    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features several human-like figures rendered in a distinct, low-poly, and faceted style. Initially, two figures stand in the foreground, heavily backlit by a reddish-white light that casts them mostly in silhouette. Their forms, which appear to be male and dressed in collared shirts, are defined by the light catching the edges of their geometric surfaces. Their faces are indistinct. As the camera moves upward, more figures with the same low-poly, backlit appearance are revealed in the background. These additional figures are either standing or sitting at simple, red-colored desks. All the figures are rendered in a grayish-white tone, with their features obscured by the strong backlighting and stylized design.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Two stylized, low-polygon human figures stand in a dark, undefined space, strongly backlit by a warm, reddish-white glow that highlights their geometric forms. The scene then reveals a larger, dimly lit room filled with similar figures seated at red desks and chairs. The entire environment maintains a minimalist, abstract aesthetic, with the dark background punctuated by the red furniture and the glowing white figures. A small \"[3]\" icon is visible as an overlay in the bottom left corner.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium-full shot of two people. Gradually, it shifts to emphasize the environment, showing a wide shot of many people standing or sitting around without a clear focus.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium-full shot, framing two figures in the foreground, one on the left and one on the right. As the camera tilts upward and pulls back, the shot transitions into a wide shot, revealing a larger room. The two initial figures remain in the foreground, while numerous other figures and red desks populate the middle ground and background. The camera maintains a position at the subjects' level throughout the shot. A static \"[3]\" icon is present in the bottom left corner of the frame.",
