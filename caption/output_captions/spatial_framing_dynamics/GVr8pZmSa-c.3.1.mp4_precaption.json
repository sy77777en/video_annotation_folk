    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an underwater scenery shot depicting the dark and murky depths of the ocean. The view pans over a dim, indistinct seabed under a vast expanse of deep blue water, with small, light-colored particles resembling marine snow drifting slowly through the frame. A large, shadowy rock formation looms in the background. There is no main subject, as the shot is designed to convey the immense scale and mysterious atmosphere of the deep-sea environment, focusing on the vast, empty space rather than a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set deep underwater, characterized by dark blue water and dim, ambient light. The camera moves over a dark, silty seabed where small white particles drift slowly. To the right, a large, dark rock formation rises from the ocean floor.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a close-up shot.",
    "pre_caption": "This scenery video opens with a wide shot of an underwater environment. The dark seabed occupies the bottom half of the frame in the middle ground, with a large, dark rock formation positioned in the background on the right. The top half of the frame is filled with deep blue water, and small particles drift in the foreground and middle ground. The camera then moves forward and slightly downward, transitioning into a close-up shot that focuses on the seabed. In this final framing, the seabed fills the entire view, and the rock formation is no longer visible. The camera maintains a position above the seabed, looking down throughout the shot.",
