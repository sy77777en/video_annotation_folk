    "pre_caption": "The clip is shot from a first-person POV. It begins with a bird\u2019s-eye view of a person\u2019s bare feet positioned in the bottom center foreground, with a dark, textured carpet filling the rest of the frame. The camera then tilts upward and rises, panning slightly, to show a room from a level angle. As the view changes, a wooden chest of drawers enters the frame in the center middle ground, with rolled white towels on its top surface and a framed picture hanging on the wall above it. To the right of the chest, white built-in closet doors are visible in the right middle ground, and a white wooden chair with a patterned cushion is positioned in the right foreground. An open doorway is situated in the left middle ground, offering a view into an adjacent room. The room's slanted ceiling, featuring a skylight and an exposed wooden beam, occupies the top center background of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a first-person perspective looking down at a pair of bare feet standing on a brown carpeted floor; the lower legs are clad in blue jeans. The camera then pans up and around, revealing a room, possibly an attic bedroom. Visible furnishings include a wooden chest of drawers with rolled white towels placed on top and a framed picture hanging above it, white built-in closet doors with round wooden knobs, and a white wooden chair with a floral-patterned cushion. The room has white walls, a slanted ceiling with a skylight and an exposed wooden beam, and the same brown carpet seen initially. A doorway offers a view into an adjacent room, possibly a bathroom.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, begins looking down at bare feet standing on a dark, textured carpet. The view then tilts upwards, revealing an indoor room with a sloped ceiling, a wooden beam, and a skylight. The room contains a wooden chest of drawers, upon which sit rolled white towels and a framed, colorful abstract painting. To the right of the chest are white, built-in wardrobe doors with round wooden knobs. A light-colored wooden chair with a floral-patterned cushion is positioned in front of the wardrobe. An open doorway to the left offers a glimpse into an adjoining bathroom with a visible sink. To the left of the open doorway, another wooden chest of drawers with a framed colorful abstract painting on top becomes visible as the camera tilts upward. The overall lighting is somewhat subdued.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The clip is shot from a first-person POV. It begins with a bird\u2019s-eye view of a person\u2019s feet, then tilts upward and rises to show a room from a level angle.",
