    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a serene winter landscape. The camera remains stationary throughout, capturing the entire scene without any noticeable movement or change in shot size. In the foreground, snow-covered ground stretches across the bottom of the frame, with a few scattered trees and a swing set positioned towards the right side. These elements occupy the lower third of the frame and are situated in the foreground. The middle ground features two rustic wooden buildings with white-trimmed windows, placed centrally and slightly to the left. They are surrounded by tall evergreen trees, which are also covered in snow. The buildings and trees are positioned between the foreground and the background, creating a layered effect. The background is dominated by majestic, snow-dusted mountains that rise steeply, filling the upper half of the frame from left to right. The sky above is overcast, contributing to the soft, diffused lighting. The camera's height appears to be at eye level, providing a direct view of the scene. There are no changes in the spatial positioning of the elements within the frame during the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a serene winter environment with snow-covered trees, rustic wooden buildings, and majestic mountains in the background. The focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the natural setting rather than any specific object. The snow blankets the ground and trees, creating a tranquil and cohesive scene that emphasizes the beauty and vastness of the landscape. The presence of the mountains adds depth and grandeur, while the buildings blend into the environment, enhancing the sense of harmony with nature.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a serene winter landscape in an outdoor setting, featuring a snow-covered area with a backdrop of rugged, snow-dusted mountains. The time of day is likely morning or late afternoon, as the light is soft and diffused. The scene includes several dark wooden cabins with white-trimmed windows, nestled among tall evergreen trees and bare deciduous trees, all blanketed in snow. A swing set and a picnic table are visible, partially covered by snow, adding to the tranquil atmosphere. The overall color palette is dominated by whites and muted browns, creating a calm and cohesive winter scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
