    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features the classic animated characters Tom and Jerry. Tom, the blue-gray cat with a white muzzle, white paws, yellow eyes with black pupils, and pink inner ears, is seen hanging from a golden chandelier with both paws. Jerry, the small brown mouse with a lighter brown belly, large eyes, and pink inner ears, stands on the chandelier above Tom. As Tom tries hard to catch Jerry, he loses his grip, and both characters are shown falling, with Jerry positioned above Tom as they descend.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a cozy living room setting, warmly lit for evening or nighttime. A striking, gold-colored metal chandelier with multiple lit bulbs encased in cylindrical glass shades takes center stage. The room features light-colored walls, a window revealing the dark night outside, and a light-colored floor. Furnishings include stylish black and white striped armchairs and a round table with a light-colored surface. Modern, geometric wall-mounted lamps add to the ambient lighting. In a lively scene, animated characters Tom and Jerry are interacting with the chandelier. Tom is trying to catch Jerry, causing the chandelier to sway continuously. This playful chase results in the chandelier flickering and eventually going out, as if experiencing a short-circuit or loose connection.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, framing Tom in the center of the screen and the middle ground, hanging from a golden chandelier. Jerry is positioned directly above Tom, also in the center and middle ground, standing on the chandelier. The chandelier itself is a prominent element in the center and middle ground. Background elements include a window in the top left, striped armchairs in the bottom left and extending towards the center background, a round table in the center background, and a wall lamp in the top right. As Tom swings, his body and paws move dynamically within the frame, with parts of him momentarily appearing closer to the foreground. The camera maintains a position at the subjects' level. Subsequently, both Tom and Jerry fall downwards; Jerry is positioned above Tom as they descend from the center towards the bottom of the frame. During this fall, the chandelier moves towards the top of the frame, and the shot continues to track the characters, maintaining a medium shot.",
