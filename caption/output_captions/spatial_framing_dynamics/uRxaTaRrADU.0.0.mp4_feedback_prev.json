    "pre_caption": "This medium shot, filmed at the subject's level, centers on a woman in a white dress positioned in the middle ground on a staircase. A metal railing extends diagonally from the bottom left to the top right in the foreground. Initially, the woman is seated on the stairs, holding the railing. She then gracefully lifts her left leg vertically into a standing split, holding her foot with her hand. Her position remains in the center of the frame as she performs this movement, while the camera stays static. The background is dark, with a few out-of-focus lights visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with long brown hair, dressed as a ballerina in a white, high-neck, sleeveless dress and pointe shoes, is on a staircase at night. She uses the metal railing for support as she gracefully performs a standing split, lifting her left leg vertically and holding her foot with her hand. The scene is dramatically lit by a single spotlight from above, which illuminates her form against the surrounding darkness, with some streetlights visible in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor staircase is shown at night, enveloped in darkness. The scene is illuminated by a single, bright overhead light that casts a focused beam from above, creating a high-contrast effect. The staircase features a series of parallel metal railings that recede into the dark background. A woman in a white dress is standing on the stairs, holding onto the railing. The camera moves in a subtle, smooth clockwise arc, adding a dynamic element to the scene. In the background, the environment is mostly obscured by the darkness, with a few distant, out-of-focus lights visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
