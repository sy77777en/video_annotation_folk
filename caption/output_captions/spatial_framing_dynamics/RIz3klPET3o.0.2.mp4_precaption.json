    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black, stick-figure cyclist, rendered with pronounced simplicity, features a circular head and a solid black body. The cyclist wears a blue and red scarf, adding a touch of color. The minimalist bicycle is drawn with a single unadorned circular wheel. The scene includes other stark, black, hand-drawn style elements: a thick, undulating line; a \"V\"-shaped mark; a short horizontal dash; a cursive symbol similar to a musical mordent; an uppercase letter \"P\"; and the numeral \"10\", composed of a simple vertical line and a roughly drawn circle. The road is depicted with simple lines, including stair-like patterns, arcs, and straight lines.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video, where the camera is placed to the side capturing the scene in profile, shows a minimalist, 2D environment with a plain, light gray background. A thick, black, wavy line undulates across the screen, forming a path with inclines, declines, and flat sections. Various abstract black markings, including a symbol resembling \">\", a musical rest symbol, the letter 'P', and the number '10', appear in different locations within this stark, monochromatic setting. A small, stick-figure-like character on a bicycle navigates this drawn track.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is an extreme wide shot with a side-view camera perspective, maintaining a consistent distance from the action. Initially, a stick-figure cyclist is positioned in the top right of the frame, situated on a small, flat segment of a thick, black, undulating line that serves as a path. This path originates from the bottom left, extends towards the center, and then rises to the cyclist's starting point, all within the middle ground. Also in the middle ground, a \"V\"-shaped mark is visible in the top right, a short horizontal dash is in the center right, and a cursive symbol is in the bottom right. The cyclist then moves from the top right platform, descending along the undulating line towards the bottom right. As the cyclist travels, the numeral \"10\" appears in the center of the frame, and an uppercase letter \"P\" appears in the center right, both in the middle ground and flanking the path. The cyclist eventually settles on a curved portion of the line in the bottom right.",
