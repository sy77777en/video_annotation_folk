    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a vibrant urban environment at sunset, with the focus on the expansive view rather than a specific object. The scene includes towering cranes and modern glass buildings, emphasizing the scale and development of the city. The sky is painted with a gradient of warm oranges and cool blues, creating a dramatic atmosphere. The composition highlights the interplay between the constructed environment and the natural beauty of the sunset, rather than centering on a single subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows an outdoor construction site in a city at sunset. The sky transitions from a bright blue to a warm orange and yellow. Several tall buildings surround the construction site, including a modern glass skyscraper. As the camera moves forward, the modern glass skyscraper gradually disappears from the left side of the frame, while the red concrete pump fades out of view on the right. Two large construction cranes stand prominently within the site, their metal frames reaching high into the sky. The construction site itself is filled with metal beams, concrete forms, and other building materials.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a cityscape during sunset. The camera captures a broad view of the urban environment, showing the entire construction site and surrounding buildings. Initially, a modern glass skyscraper occupies the left side of the frame in the foreground, while two large construction cranes dominate the center and slightly to the right in the middle ground. The cranes extend vertically, reaching into the sky. The construction site fills the lower portion of the frame, with various building materials scattered across it. In the background, additional buildings are visible, contributing to the urban skyline. As the camera moves forward, the modern glass skyscraper gradually exits the frame from the left, shifting the focus more towards the center where the cranes remain prominent. The red concrete pump, initially on the right side of the frame in the foreground, also fades out of view. The camera maintains a height above the construction site, providing a clear aerial perspective throughout the sequence. The sky, transitioning from blue to warm hues, serves as a backdrop, enhancing the depth of the scene.",
