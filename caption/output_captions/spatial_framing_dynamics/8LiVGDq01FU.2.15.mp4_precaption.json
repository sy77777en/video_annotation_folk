    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a close-up of a middle-aged Caucasian man wearing a white and grey spacesuit, complete with a helmet featuring a clear visor. His mouth is open, and his eyes are wide, conveying a sense of exertion or distress. He briefly closes his eyes before the video cuts to a plain, off-white screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a close-up of an astronaut in a white and grey spacesuit and helmet, with a clear visor revealing their face. The background is a brightly lit, out-of-focus environment filled with shelves of books, suggesting an interior space. Subsequently, the surroundings change, shifting and arcing rapidly around the astronaut, with a strong light enveloping the scene. Ultimately, the scene transitions to a completely plain, off-white screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up of a man in a spacesuit, positioned in the center foreground. The background, brightly lit and out-of-focus, features what appear to be shelves of books surrounding him. As the scene progresses, these background elements begin to shift and arc rapidly around the man, who remains in the center foreground, while a strong light increasingly envelops the scene. The man then disappears from the frame, and the entire view transitions to a plain, off-white screen. The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level.",
