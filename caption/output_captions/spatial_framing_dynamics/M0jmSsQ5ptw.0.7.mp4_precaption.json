    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In an outdoor setting, a large, A-frame wooden structure resembling a catapult, with some blue-painted beams, stands on the left. To the right is a translucent dark cloth, through which the blue sky and white clouds are visible. In the foreground, a low structure covered in green artificial turf has a visible layered cross-section of white and tan materials. A white, semi-circular ramp, holding a small white ball, extends from this structure. A single, vertical wooden post rises nearby, connected to the catapult by a taut white string. The string is suddenly released, flying loosely through the air, and the white ball disappears from the ramp, indicating a launch has occurred.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Shot from a low angle, the scene unfolds on a vast, paved expanse under a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds, with distant mountains on the horizon. In the immediate foreground, a ramp made of white pipe leads up to a small platform topped with green artificial turf. A central wooden post supports a white string that is initially taut before it snaps loose and flies through the air. To the left stands a large, A-frame wooden structure with blue-painted elements, and to the right is a large rectangular backdrop, colored blue and orange, with a small red flag at its peak.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a low angle at the subject's level, captures an outdoor scene with several structures. In the foreground, a low platform with a white ramp extends from the bottom center towards the right, holding a small white ball. A large, A-frame structure is positioned in the middle ground on the left, while a single vertical post stands in the middle ground center, and a large blue backdrop is on the middle ground right. A taut white string initially connects the A-frame structure to the central post. The scene's action begins as the string is released, becoming slack and flying through the center of the frame, while the white ball simultaneously disappears from its position on the ramp in the foreground.",
