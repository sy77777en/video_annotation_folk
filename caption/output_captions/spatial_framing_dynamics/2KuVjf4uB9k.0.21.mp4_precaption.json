    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a red sports car with a prominent number \"42\" on its side, drifting on a winding, dusty road. The car has a sleek design with a visible engine and a large rear spoiler. It emits thick white smoke from its tires, indicating high-speed movement and sharp turns. The car's glossy red paint and aerodynamic shape are highlighted as it maneuvers through the curves, showcasing its agility and power. The setting is flat terrain, enhancing the focus on the car's performance. As the camera transitions from the back to the front of the red car, a gray car can be seen driving behind it, adding an element of competition to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from an overhead perspective, presents a view of a winding mountain road. The setting is outdoors, with a clear sky indicating daytime. The road curves through a rugged landscape, bordered by rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. A red sports car, notable for its sleek design and visible engine, drifts along the road, creating plumes of smoke that contrast with the earthy tones of the surroundings. As the camera moves forward and pans right, it transitions to a position in front of the red sports car, revealing a gray race car in pursuit behind it. The car's movement is dynamic, emphasizing the sharp turns and elevation changes of the road. The scene captures the interplay between the vehicle's vibrant color and the natural, muted backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a full shot of a red sports car drifting on a winding road. Initially, the car occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The camera, placed above the car, captures its entire body as it navigates the curve. The car's 2D position shifts slightly from the center-left towards the center-right as it drifts. The road, visible in the foreground and background, frames the car dynamically. Sparse vegetation and rocky terrain border the road, situated in the background. As the car continues its turn, the camera maintains its overhead position, smoothly transitioning from behind to in front of the car. This shift reveals a gray car following behind, initially in the bottom right corner of the frame and moving towards the center. The gray car remains in the background throughout, emphasizing the distance between the two vehicles. The camera's consistent height above the cars ensures a clear view of their movements and the surrounding landscape.",
