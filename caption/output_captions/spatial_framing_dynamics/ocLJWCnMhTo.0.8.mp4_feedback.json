    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, framing a person from the waist up, positioned centrally on a vertical pole in the middle ground. A fiery, yellow-orange light effect is initially seen on the left, flowing around the person's arm. The person then inverts their body, hanging upside down from the pole. As this happens, the camera, mounted on a crane, pulls back into a full shot, revealing the entire figure. The camera starts from a high angle above the subject, descends to a low angle below the inverted person, and then levels out at the subject's height. Throughout this transition, the fiery light effect continues to move dynamically along the central pole and the person's body, while the background remains out of focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with dark, possibly braided or dreadlocked hair is shown upright on a vertical pole, dressed in dark clothing. They remain stationary as a bright, fiery, yellow-orange light effect dynamically flows around their arm and torso.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting with dim, warm lighting, a silhouetted figure is suspended motionless on a central vertical pole. A bright, yellow-orange, flame-like light effect flickers and moves along the pole. The background is indistinct, showing a wall in soft focus. The entire scene is presented with a low-resolution, analog video quality, characterized by visible scan lines and a hazy, warm color palette, and is framed by black bars on the left and right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera moves on a crane. It starts above the subject, then moves below, before ending at the same height as the subject.",
