    "pre_caption": "Initially, the video presents a full shot of a black limousine positioned slightly right of center in the middle ground, moving towards the left. Buildings form the background, while the road occupies the foreground and middle ground. The camera pans left, tracking the limousine as it moves across the frame and eventually exits to the left. Following this, a black SUV enters the frame from the right, also in a full shot and occupying the middle ground. The camera continues its leftward pan, tracking the SUV as it moves from the right towards the left side of the frame. The urban background and road remain consistent. Throughout the sequence, the camera maintains a position level with both vehicles.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two distinct vehicles. Initially, a large black limousine is prominently displayed, characterized by its sleek design and shiny exterior. It has an American flag mounted on the front, indicating its official or ceremonial use. The limousine's windows are tinted, and it bears a distinctive emblem on the side, suggesting a high level of importance or security. As the video progresses, the focus transitions to a black SUV. This vehicle has a robust and sturdy appearance, with chrome wheels and visible roof-mounted equipment, possibly for communication or emergency purposes. The SUV's rear lights are uniquely designed with a red and white pattern. Both vehicles are moving along a city street, indicating a convoy or procession.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set on a paved city street during daylight hours, bordered by modern buildings featuring large glass windows. A long, black limousine, distinguished by US and Presidential flags on its front fenders and a seal on the rear door, is shown driving along the road. Following this, a black SUV, equipped with a red emergency light bar on its roof, travels down the same street. Both vehicles are depicted in motion within this urban environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
