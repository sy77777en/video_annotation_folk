    "pre_caption": "A full shot shows a 3D model of a translucent partition positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. It stands on a glossy, reflective surface in the foreground, which mirrors its form against a dark background. The camera, positioned above the subject, slowly rotates counter-clockwise around the partition. Around the six-second mark, the partition's design changes, with its legs disappearing so that the panels become flush with the reflective surface. The camera's rotation continues, offering a comprehensive view of the object from multiple angles.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A 3D model of a bathroom stall partition is presented against a dark, reflective surface. The partition is made of a translucent, frosted material, possibly representing glass or acrylic, and is shaped into a four-sided, open-topped enclosure. One of the front panels functions as a door, connected by small, metallic-looking hinges. Initially, the entire structure is slightly elevated off the ground on small feet. Around six seconds into the video, the panels change, and the gaps that originally formed the legs are removed, making the structure flush with the ground. The partition rotates slowly, allowing for a view from multiple angles, with its reflection visible on the glossy surface below.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A 3D model of a three-sided, translucent partition with a hinged door is centered against a dark, gradient background. The partition, made of a frosted material, stands on a glossy, reflective surface that mirrors its form. The camera slowly rotates around the object, providing a comprehensive view. A white overlay text \"[9]\" is visible at the bottom left of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
