    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A spiny lobster, the main subject, rests on a patch of white sand within a crevice of a vibrant coral reef. Its long, spindly legs are patterned with black and white bands, ending in yellow tips. Two very long, thin, white antennae extend from its head, curving out into the surrounding water. Numerous small, bright orange fish swim around the lobster and the reef. In the upper left, a long, thin, snake-like creature with a black and white beaded pattern is draped over the coral.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An underwater scene reveals a vibrant coral reef composed of red, pink, and purple formations surrounding a patch of light-colored sand. A spiny lobster with a striped body and long, white antennae is positioned in the center on the sand. Small orange fish swim around the colorful coral, and a long, thin, patterned creature is partially visible in the upper left.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "A full shot frames a spiny lobster in the center of the frame and the middle ground, resting on a patch of white sand. This sandy area is encircled by a vibrant coral reef that occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame, the middle ground around the lobster, and the background in the upper portion of the scene. Numerous small orange fish are scattered throughout the middle ground, swimming around the reef. In the top left of the frame, a long, patterned, snake-like creature is draped over the coral in the middle ground. The camera is positioned above the lobster, providing a downward view of the static scene.",
