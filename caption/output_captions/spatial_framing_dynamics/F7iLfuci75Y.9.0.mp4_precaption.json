    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features four humanoid figures seated at desks, each facing a computer screen. These figures have a metallic appearance, suggesting they might be robots or mannequins. They are positioned in a dimly lit room, with two figures visible in the middleground and two in the background. Each figure is oriented towards their respective screen, with their heads slightly tilted as if focused on the monitors. The figures are uniformly dressed in dark clothing, and their metallic heads reflect the light from the screens, creating a consistent visual theme throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, four figures with a reflective, metallic quality are present. Two of them are seated in a row at black desks, while the other two are positioned opposite each other, to the left and behind the first two. Dressed in black, they sit in matching office chairs, each facing a computer. The monitors are the primary light source, casting a blue glow onto the figures and their surroundings. Each screen displays a light blue background with a white, window-like logo. The overall environment is dark and monochromatic, defined by the arrangement of workstations.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, four humanoid figures are positioned at desks in a dimly lit room. In the right middle ground, one figure is seen from the back, with another figure to its left in the center middle ground. A third figure is located in the left background, while a fourth figure and its computer partially occupy the left foreground. Each figure sits in front of a computer monitor, which is the main source of light. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
