    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark-skinned, bald man is shown sitting on a red block. He is wearing a blue athletic tank top with \"USA\" printed on the front and matching blue athletic shorts. He holds a pink and orange baton in his hands. He then stands up. In the upper right, the arm and hand of a light-skinned person wearing a white short-sleeved shirt are partially visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in an indoor athletic venue, characterized by a large, blue, dotted digital screen in the background that displays the white text \"I MOVE.\" Above the screen, gray structural framework and black cables are visible. In the foreground, a man in a blue athletic uniform sits on a red block with \"MONDO\" printed in white, holding a pink baton. He subsequently stands up, facing slightly to the left, with his body oriented sideways toward the camera.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a man is initially sitting in the center-right foreground on a red block located in the bottom right. In the top right, an arm is partially visible in the middle ground. A large blue screen spans the middle ground behind the man, with structural framework visible in the background at the top of the frame. The man then stands up, moving upward and slightly to the left within the frame, turning to face the left side of the scene. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and remains static throughout the shot.",
