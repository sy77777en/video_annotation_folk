    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a dining table scene, initially set with a metallic pitcher and a bowl casting shadows. As the scene progresses, a person off-screen places a tray of neatly arranged watermelon slices on the table, each slice displaying vibrant red flesh with black seeds and green rinds. This action transforms the setting from simple to vibrant, enhancing the overall composition. The table is surrounded by wooden chairs, and the lighting creates distinct shadows, adding depth to the arrangement. The focus shifts from the empty table setup to the colorful and inviting display of fruit, highlighting the transition to a more lively and detailed composition.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an overhead POV shot of a serene indoor setting, capturing a wooden dining table with a light, natural finish. The table is bathed in soft, warm daylight, suggesting a calm, sunny day. Notable elements include a metallic pitcher with a reflective surface and a ceramic bowl, both casting distinct shadows on the table. The scene transitions to reveal a wooden tray with neatly arranged watermelon slices on white paper, adding a vibrant contrast with their red and green hues. The surrounding chairs, with their simple wooden design, frame the table, enhancing the cozy, inviting atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle shot focused on a tabletop, with a pitcher and bowl situated in the top left of the frame in the middle ground. The backs of chairs are visible in the foreground along the left and right edges. A hand enters from the bottom of the frame and moves upward, placing a tray of watermelon slices in the center of the frame, which becomes the subject of a full shot. The tray settles in the middle ground, positioning the pitcher and bowl in the relative background, as the camera maintains its static overhead perspective.",
