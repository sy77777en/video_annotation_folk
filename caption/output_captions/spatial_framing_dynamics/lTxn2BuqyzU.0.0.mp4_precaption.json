    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a dining table scene, initially set with a metallic pitcher and a bowl casting shadows. As the scene progresses, a person off-screen places a tray of neatly arranged watermelon slices on the table, each slice displaying vibrant red flesh with black seeds and green rinds. This action transforms the setting from simple to vibrant, enhancing the overall composition. The table is surrounded by wooden chairs, and the lighting creates distinct shadows, adding depth to the arrangement. The focus shifts from the empty table setup to the colorful and inviting display of fruit, highlighting the transition to a more lively and detailed composition.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an overhead POV shot of a serene indoor setting, capturing a wooden dining table with a light, natural finish. The table is bathed in soft, warm daylight, suggesting a calm, sunny day. Notable elements include a metallic pitcher with a reflective surface and a ceramic bowl, both casting distinct shadows on the table. The scene transitions to reveal a wooden tray with neatly arranged watermelon slices on white paper, adding a vibrant contrast with their red and green hues. The surrounding chairs, with their simple wooden design, frame the table, enhancing the cozy, inviting atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a full shot that captures a dining table scene from an overhead perspective. Initially, the table is set with a metallic pitcher and a bowl, both positioned near the top center of the frame in the foreground. These objects cast distinct shadows across the table's surface. Wooden chairs surround the table, with two visible on the left and one on the right side, all in the middle ground. As the video progresses, a tray holding neatly arranged watermelon slices is introduced into the scene. The tray moves from the bottom right corner towards the center of the frame, eventually settling near the middle of the table. The watermelon slices, placed on white paper, occupy the central area of the tray, becoming the focal point. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining its overhead position above the table, ensuring a consistent view of the evolving composition. The spatial dynamics shift from a simple setup with minimal elements to a more detailed and vibrant arrangement as the tray is added.",
