    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a 3D-animated scene. A large, translucent cylinder occupies the right side of the frame, positioned in the foreground. In the middle ground, a small hammer is visible in the bottom left quadrant. Further in the background, a coordinate axis system made of colorful spheres is located in the top left. A small nail protrudes from the cylinder's base, positioned near the center-left of the frame. The camera then executes a rapid zoom-in, transitioning to a close-up that focuses on the area of the cylinder just above the nail. In this final framing, the nail is at the bottom of the frame, and the center is occupied by cracks forming on the cylinder's surface. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a 3D-animated scene, a large, translucent cylinder with a glowing, solid, blue-green core stands on a dark base. A small metal nail protrudes from the side of the translucent cylinder near its bottom. As the view focuses on this area, cracks begin to form and spread across the surface of the translucent material. In the background, a small hammer with a wooden handle and a metal head is suspended in the air. Nearby is a coordinate axis system, composed of red, blue, and green spheres, each perpendicular to the others, connected by short rods.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a high-tech setting, a scene unfolds on a dark, gridded floor intersected by glowing red and green lines. A large, transparent cylinder containing a glowing turquoise core rests on a dark, angular base. Nearby on the floor, there is a small hammer and a coordinate axis system featuring red, blue, and green axes that are perpendicular to each other and connected by short rods. A small nail is embedded in the side of the cylinder's base. As the camera moves closer, a small notch becomes visible on the transparent surface just above the nail. A text overlay at the bottom of the screen reads, \"[25].\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a 3D simulation scene. In the foreground, there is a cylindrical object with a blue-green hue, partially visible. Nearby, there are several colorful objects (red, blue, green) connected, resembling a molecular structure. The camera then zooms in quickly to focus on the nail on the cylindrical object, and then it slightly moves to aim at the surface of the cylindrical object where cracks are forming.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
