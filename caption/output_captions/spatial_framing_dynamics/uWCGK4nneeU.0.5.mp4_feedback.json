    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up on a dark, metallic steering yoke positioned in the foreground, occupying the center and right of the frame. A spinning propeller is visible in the middle ground on the left, set against a desert landscape in the background. The camera then tilts up, transitioning to a close-up shot that reveals a woman in the center of the frame. She raises a pair of black binoculars into the foreground, holding them to her eyes. The camera remains at the subject's level, with the final composition focusing on her face and the binoculars.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on a close-up of a dark, metallic steering yoke inside a vehicle. The camera then pans up to reveal a woman with brown skin sitting in the driver's seat. She wears a dark, sleeveless, leather-like vest over a light-colored top, and a watch is visible on her right wrist. She has a small piercing in her right nostril. With a neutral expression, she raises a pair of black binoculars to her eyes and looks forward, with the reflection of a distant, reddish landscape visible in the lenses.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From inside a brown airplane, the view looks out onto a vast, sunlit desert landscape with rolling, sandy hills under a clear sky. Through a window dotted with small black spots, the constantly spinning propeller is visible on one side of the wing. In the foreground, a black metallic mount with two handles is visible. A person wearing a dark, sleeveless vest raises a pair of black binoculars to their eyes, and the desert scenery is reflected in the lenses as they look out.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a close-up shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
