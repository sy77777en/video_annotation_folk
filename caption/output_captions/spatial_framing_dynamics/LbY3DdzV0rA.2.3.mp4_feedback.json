    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot captured in a static extreme wide shot. The frame is horizontally divided, with a flat desert landscape occupying the bottom third, stretching from the foreground to the background. The upper two-thirds of the frame are filled with the sky. Initially, a large, white cloud is centered in the upper portion of the frame, with blue sky visible at the top. As the time-lapse progresses, the dark grey base of the cloud, located in the middle ground above the horizon, expands downwards and outwards, eventually covering the entire sky from left to right and casting a shadow that moves from the background across the desert floor. The camera remains stationary at a low height relative to the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a time-lapse landscape scenery shot capturing the dramatic development of a massive storm over an arid desert. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the weather system itself. A colossal, initially bright white cumulonimbus cloud against a blue sky rapidly expands and darkens, its ominous, gray base spreading to engulf the horizon. Below, a flat, tan-colored desert with sparse, dry vegetation stretches into the distance, becoming progressively shadowed as the storm rolls in.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse video captures a massive storm system forming and moving across a vast, arid desert landscape. Initially, a large, white, billowing cloud formation is set against a blue sky. As the sequence progresses, the cloud system expands, and its base darkens to a deep, turbulent grey, stretching across the horizon and obscuring the sky. Below, the flat, sandy ground is covered with sparse, dry vegetation. The advancing storm front casts a growing shadow over the landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
