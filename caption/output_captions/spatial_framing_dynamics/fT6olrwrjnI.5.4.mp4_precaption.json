    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a black and white soccer ball with hexagonal and pentagonal panels, initially positioned against a white background above a bright green, upward-sloping surface resembling a grassy field. An anime character, a young male with spiky, light-colored hair, then appears to the left of the ball. He is depicted mid-air in a dynamic pose, as if running or about to kick. He wears a dark long-sleeved undershirt beneath a white sleeveless jersey featuring the black number \"7\" and dark trim, along with white shorts, dark socks, and a dark arm sleeve. His left leg and left arm are extended forward, while his right limbs are bent backward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a soccer ball moving through the air against a bright white background, making the green grass below initially invisible. As the ball continues its motion, the vibrant green, grass-like surface and an anime-style male character with white hair and a dark athletic uniform, marked with the number \"7\", gradually come into view. The character is in a dynamic, mid-action pose near the soccer ball, while the background remains stark white.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens in a full shot, with a soccer ball centered in the frame and positioned in the middle ground against a white background; a bright green, upward-sloping surface is at the very bottom of the frame in the foreground. As the scene progresses, this green surface becomes more prominent, occupying the bottom third of the frame as it slopes from the bottom left towards the top right, remaining in the foreground. Concurrently, the framing transitions to a wide shot. An anime character appears in the center-left of the frame, to the left of the soccer ball and slightly above the green surface, in the middle ground. The soccer ball itself moves slightly to the right of the center, also in the middle ground. The background remains consistently white. Due to the 2D animation, the camera's height relative to the subjects is difficult to determine.",
