    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A stylized, orange humanoid figure with long, thin limbs and a dark-colored ponytail hairstyle is depicted in various contorted, crouching, leaping, and forward-rolling poses. This figure is positioned on and among the components of a large, complex machine. The machine itself is rendered in an unusual color palette of teal, pink, and dark purple, and is composed of numerous interconnected gears, pulleys, belts, and articulated arms in a fantastical and chaotic arrangement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a large, intricate machine with a graphic, comic-book aesthetic. The machinery consists of numerous interconnected gears, belts, and pulleys in muted shades of teal, pink, and purple, all outlined in thick black lines. The background is a textured, paper-like surface splattered with watercolor-like splotches of purple, teal, and grey, with faint gear patterns visible beneath the colors. The entire apparatus, including articulated arms and rotating parts, is in motion as an orange figure navigates the mechanical components.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It appears to be a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, an orange figure is initially positioned in the top center, crouching on a large pulley system that occupies the middle ground. The complex machinery extends across the bottom of the frame, with black pipes visible in the top left foreground against a splattered background. The figure leaps from its central position toward the top left, landing on a small platform. It then tumbles forward and down, coming to rest among a set of large gears located in the bottom center of the frame. The camera remains static throughout the sequence.",
