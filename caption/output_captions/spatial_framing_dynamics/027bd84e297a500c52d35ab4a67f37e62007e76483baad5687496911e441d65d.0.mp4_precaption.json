    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a series of nested Russian dolls, each progressively smaller and painted with intricate designs. The dolls are aligned in a straight line, with the largest at the back and the smallest at the front. Each doll has a similar design, featuring a face with a serene expression and traditional clothing in shades of blue and red. A hand with light skin tone enters the scene and gently flicks the smallest doll out of the frame, adding a playful interaction with the dolls.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a brightly lit indoor setting with a plain, light-colored background, a line of five Russian nesting dolls is arranged in order of ascending size. The wooden dolls are painted with a predominantly blue and white color scheme, featuring orange and black details and simple faces. A hand, in focus in the foreground, flicks the largest doll, causing a domino effect that topples the entire line, one doll after another.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a vertical line of five Russian nesting dolls is positioned in the center of the frame, arranged by increasing size from the foreground at the bottom towards the middle ground. The dolls in the foreground are in focus, while those further back are less sharp. A hand enters from the top right and moves into the background, positioning itself behind the dolls. The out-of-focus hand makes a flicking gesture above the largest doll in the middle ground. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the level of the dolls.",
