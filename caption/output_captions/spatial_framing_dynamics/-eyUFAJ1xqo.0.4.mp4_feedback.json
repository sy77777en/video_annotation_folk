    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a woman initially positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. To her left, a man is partially visible, also in the middle ground. The background is filled with a crowd, with vertical cyan lights located in the upper left and red lighting on the right. The woman then turns her head and body to her right, moving from the center of the frame toward the right background and deeper into the crowd. As she turns, other figures briefly pass through the foreground on the right, and the shot concludes with the back of her head visible as she moves away. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with light skin and shoulder-length, wavy blonde hair with bangs as the main subject. She is wearing a black sleeveless top and stands facing forward with a serious expression, centrally located and illuminated by blue and teal light. In the background, a crowded, dimly lit environment, likely a nightclub, is filled with other people. To her left, a man with dark hair and a dark turtleneck is partially visible in profile. Other surrounding figures are less distinct, appearing as silhouettes or blurred forms, some seemingly dancing or socializing amidst the ambient red and blue neon lighting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place inside a crowded, dimly lit nightclub, saturated with vibrant neon lighting. The environment is cast in a strong contrast of deep red and bright cyan hues. In the background, a series of vertical, glowing cyan light tubes are mounted on a dark wall, while another surface features what appears to be red-lit graffiti. The space is densely packed with the silhouettes and blurred figures of people dancing and moving, creating a dynamic and energetic atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
