    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the urban environment, capturing the atmosphere and daily life of the city rather than a specific object or person. The shot likely serves as an establishing shot, setting the scene and providing context for the location, highlighting the architecture, street activity, and overall vibe of the area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, shows a daytime street scene in Kyoto, Japan. The perspective is from a paved sidewalk facing the entrance to Gojo Station, which features a gray, arched roof. To the left, a traditional brown building has several signs with Japanese characters, and a green delivery tricycle with a purple crate is parked nearby. On the right, a silver-gray delivery truck with orange graphics is parked, and a multi-story, beige building stands in the background under a blue sky with white clouds. Pedestrians in face masks walk along the sidewalk, including a masked man walking towards the viewer. As he approaches, another man carrying goods enters the scene, moving from the right side of the screen to the left. An overlay in the center displays the text \"Kyoto Japan\" in white, with \"3 PM - August, 2021\" appearing underneath.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide, eye-level scenery shot that remains static. The foreground is occupied by a paved sidewalk. In the middle ground, a brown building and a green delivery tricycle are on the left, the entrance to Gojo Station is in the center, and a silver-gray delivery truck is on the right. The background consists of taller buildings on both the left and right sides of the frame, with a blue sky at the top. A man walks from the middle ground toward the foreground, moving from the center toward the left. As he nears the camera, another man carrying a box enters from the right foreground and walks across the frame to the left, passing in front of the first man. A text overlay appears in the center of the screen.",
