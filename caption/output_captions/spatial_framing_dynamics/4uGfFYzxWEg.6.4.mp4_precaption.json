    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A low-polygon, 3D-rendered figure of a man is depicted from the chest up. The figure is composed of flat, geometric shapes in shades of beige and light brown and is wearing what appears to be a collared shirt. He holds a dark, old-style mobile phone or receiver to his left ear with his left hand. His right hand is extended forward with an open palm, as if gesturing while speaking. The figure is oriented slightly toward the left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting with a dark, textured background, a row of glowing, white, vertical ovals is visible, resembling a sound wave display. A central, low-poly, geometric figure rendered in a golden-brown color is depicted holding an object to its ear. The scene includes overlay elements: in the bottom left corner, white text reads \"ITV - Major Fraud (2003),\" and white subtitles at the bottom of the screen display the words \"during the taping of the show in which you participated.\" Additionally, text at the bottom of the screen displays the words: \"Oh good lord, no.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium shot centers on a low-polygon figure of a man positioned in the middle ground. In the background, a horizontal row of glowing white ovals stretches across the frame behind the figure. Text overlays are visible in the foreground, with one in the bottom left corner and subtitles at the bottom center. The camera is static and positioned at the subject's level, while the figure's right hand makes a slight forward gesturing motion.",
