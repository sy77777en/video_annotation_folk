    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an elderly woman wearing a patterned headscarf and a gray cardigan over a dark dress with a dotted design. She is holding an umbrella with a decorative pattern. In one part of the video, she is bending down, possibly interacting with a bag on the ground, as she holds a small brown object in her hand. The setting appears to be outdoors, with grass visible around her.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting on a cloudy day, featuring a grassy area with scattered stones. A person is holding an umbrella, suggesting light rain or the potential for rain, and is seen picking up a small object from the ground. The environment is natural, with a focus on the ground where the interaction occurs. The overall atmosphere is calm, with muted colors reflecting the overcast sky, and the setting is serene, with no visible urban elements, emphasizing the natural landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot focusing on an elderly woman. She is wearing a patterned headscarf, a gray cardigan, and a dark dress with a dotted design. She is holding an umbrella with a decorative pattern. As the video progresses, the camera shifts to a medium shot, revealing more of her upper body and surroundings. The woman bends down, possibly interacting with a bag on the ground, while holding a small brown object in her hand. The setting is an outdoor grassy area with scattered stones, suggesting a natural, serene environment. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. The transition from the close-up to the medium shot provides a broader view of the scene, emphasizing the woman's actions and the tranquil outdoor setting.",
