    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a young boy of East Asian descent, wearing clear safety goggles over his eyes and a white, short-sleeved button-up shirt with faint writing on it. He stands at a white table, wearing a white disposable glove on his right hand, as he carefully uses a dropper to draw a pink liquid from a small bottle he holds in his left hand. To his left, a young girl with blonde hair, dressed in a plaid shirt, sits and writes in an open notebook. On the table in front of them are three large glass flasks; the one on the far left contains a reddish-brown liquid, the middle one contains a bright orange liquid, and the one on the right contains a bright pink liquid.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a brightly lit indoor space resembling a science classroom or laboratory during the day. In the background, a black chalkboard and a white wall are adorned with yellow sticky notes and a scientific diagram of a human torso. Potted plants, including a large leafy one and a tall cactus-like plant, are positioned on either side. A white table in the foreground is arranged with scientific glassware, featuring three flasks: a large, round-bottom glass flask filled with a bright orange liquid, another glass flask containing a vibrant pink liquid, and a third flask at the far left edge with a reddish-brown liquid. A young person in a white shirt and safety goggles stands behind the table, handling a dropper with pink liquid, while another child is partially visible to the right, writing in a notebook.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a young boy is positioned in the center middle ground, holding a dropper and a small bottle. In the foreground, a large round-bottom flask containing orange liquid is on the left, while a volumetric flask with pink liquid is in the right middle ground. A girl is partially visible in the middle ground on the right, writing in a notebook. The background features a chalkboard in the center, flanked by plants on the left and right. The camera slowly pulls back and pans slightly to the right, revealing more of the girl and a beaker with reddish-brown liquid in the far-left foreground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
