    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the size of the subject in the video. If it\u2019s not clear, describe how much of the subject is visible.\n\nNext, describe the **subjects and elements\u2019 spatial position in the video**. Indicate their approximate 2D position within the frame, such as **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, centre**. Describe their 3D position within the frame, such as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Try to analyze as many elements as you can see. Each time you mention an element, you need to explain its 2D and 3D position in the frame.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end of  this text. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes within the frame, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.  \n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scene in this video but do not capture their spatial framing and dynamics. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on it completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and dynamics in this video. The given caption is only to help you learn the video thoroughly, so don't rely on it too much. Focus on the Spatial framing and dynamics and don\u2019t write too much about the subject appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a series of nested Russian dolls, known as matryoshka dolls, arranged in a line. Each doll is painted with a blue and white design, featuring a woman with a headscarf and traditional attire. The dolls decrease in size from back to front, with the largest at the back and the smallest at the front. The hand flicks the smallest matryoshka doll out of the frame. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases a minimalist indoor setting with a plain, light-colored background. The even lighting creates a serene atmosphere. **\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a series of nested Russian dolls, known as matryoshka dolls, arranged in a line. The dolls are positioned centrally within the frame, extending from the foreground to the background. The largest doll is in the background, while the smallest is in the foreground. The camera is at the same height as the dolls, providing a direct view of their painted designs. Initially, all dolls are visible, but the smallest doll is flicked out of the frame by a hand entering from the top right, altering the composition to focus on the remaining dolls. The setting is minimalist, with a plain, light-colored background that remains consistent throughout the video.",
