    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a rocket-propelled grenade launcher prominently displayed on a corrugated surface. The launcher has a distinct design with a wooden grip and a metallic body, showcasing a combination of dark and polished metal parts. The wooden section is reddish-brown, contrasting with the sleek, dark metal. The launcher is positioned horizontally, with its barrel extending towards the right. Adjacent to the launcher, there are two green, conical rocket-propelled grenades, each with a pointed tip and cylindrical body, lying parallel to the launcher. The grenades have a smooth, matte finish, and their color is a muted olive green. The overall composition highlights the launcher and grenades as the central subjects, emphasizing their detailed construction and arrangement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a rocket launcher and three rockets resting on a dark green surface with parallel ridges. The launcher has a dark metal body, a reddish-brown wooden stock and grip, and a black muzzle end. The rockets are light green, cylindrical, with pointed tips and fins. The scene is dimly lit, with focused light casting shadows across the ridged surface. The view initially focuses on the rear part of the launcher before revealing the entire weapon and the adjacent rockets.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, the video initially focuses on the rear wooden stock of a rocket launcher, positioned diagonally from the bottom left towards the top right in the foreground/middle ground, resting on a ridged green surface in the background. The view then expands rightward, revealing the full length of the launcher, which maintains its diagonal foreground/middle ground position. Two rockets appear parallel to the launcher on the right side of the frame, also in the foreground/middle ground. The camera is positioned above the subjects throughout the shot.",
