    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Against a solid black background, a series of three-dimensional, gray-framed photographs is displayed, but only the nearest one is clearly visible, depicting an office scene. Inside this photograph, a white man with short, light-colored hair stands behind a large, dark wooden desk. He is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt, a red tie, and dark trousers, and is posed with his hands on his hips, facing forward. The office has light-colored walls, a brown leather chair behind the desk, and a circular seal visible on the window panel. The entire framed photograph slowly moves closer to the viewer.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, abstract environment, a series of black rectangular blocks recede into the background. The foremost block is presented as a three-dimensional frame, revealing a brightly lit interior scene. This scene depicts an office with light-colored walls and carpeting. A large, polished wooden desk is centrally positioned and extends towards the right side of the image, accompanied by a high-backed leather chair. To the right, a small window resembling those found on airplanes is visible, featuring a circular seal on its panel and notably uncovered by the adjacent curtain. A man in a shirt and tie stands behind the desk in the static composition.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video appears to be computer-generated. With a pitch-black background throughout, a full shot photo of a person\u2014containing a scene of an office\u2014slowly approaches the camera, eventually nearly filling the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The background is completely dark, making it difficult to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is set against a solid black background, with a three-dimensional, framed, full shot of an office scene positioned in the left-center foreground. To the right of this frame, a series of solid black rectangular blocks recede into the background, creating depth. Within the framed image, a man stands in the center middle ground, behind a large wooden desk that occupies the center of the composition. A leather chair is visible in the middle ground to the right of the man, and a window with a seal is on the right wall. A door is positioned in the background on the left. The entire arrangement, led by the framed photo, slowly moves forward, causing the photo to enlarge and gradually fill more of the screen. The background is completely dark, making it difficult to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
