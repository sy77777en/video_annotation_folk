    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a sleek, angular object with a futuristic design, resembling a stylized, abstract sculpture. It has a metallic surface with a reflective finish, displaying a combination of dark and light tones that shift as the object rotates. The object resembles a flattened triangular shape with many angular edges. Its shape is asymmetrical, with sharp edges. The object\u2019s orientation changes, highlighting its multifaceted structure and intricate design.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases an abstract, minimalist scene with a dark background resembling a water surface. A central metallic object with a sleek, angular design is suspended in the air. A thin, vertical green light is also in the background. There is added text in the lower left corner that shows \u201c[5]\u201d.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a sleek, angular object with a futuristic design, occupying a significant portion of the frame throughout. Initially, the object is positioned near the center-left of the frame, partially submerged in what appears to be a dark, water-like surface in the foreground. As the video progresses, the object rises vertically, moving from the foreground into the middle ground, and eventually hovers above the surface. The object's orientation shifts from a tilted angle to a more horizontal position, revealing its multifaceted structure. A thin, vertical green light remains consistently in the background, slightly to the right of the object. The camera maintains a fixed position, capturing the object's movement from below, emphasizing its ascent and rotation. The dark background and water-like surface remain static, providing a stark contrast to the dynamic motion of the object. The lower left corner consistently displays the text \"[5]\".",
