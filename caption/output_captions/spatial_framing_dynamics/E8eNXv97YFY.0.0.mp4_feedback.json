    "pre_caption": "This scenery video begins with an extreme wide shot of a public plaza. A curved fountain basin is in the bottom left foreground, with the expansive reddish-brown plaza filling the lower half of the frame. A tall monument is positioned in the center middle ground, with trees and buildings lining the plaza in the middle ground and background. The shot then cuts to a wide shot, reframing the scene. The monument is now positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground, with a prominent palm tree in the right middle ground. A bench occupies the left foreground, while two people on motorcycles are in the right foreground. The camera is positioned at a low height, looking up at the monument and the sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a spacious public square under a dramatic, cloud-filled sky. The video lacks a single main subject, as the wide-angle perspective and camera movement emphasize the expansive atmosphere and architectural features of the location rather than any particular individual or object. At the heart of the reddish-brown tiled plaza stands a tall, slender white monument with an ornate, golden, traditional-style top, surrounded by a decorative pool, benches, and green trees, including a prominent palm tree.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse captures a large, open public plaza during the day under a partly cloudy sky. In the center of the red-brown paved plaza stands a tall, white monument with a gilded, ornate top, situated on a multi-tiered base. A curved, concrete fountain basin sits in the foreground. The plaza is lined with green trees and buildings in the background. Throughout the sequence, the camera's perspective shifts around the central monument, while puffy white and grey clouds move swiftly across the blue sky. A few people and vehicles can be seen moving quickly through the area.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
