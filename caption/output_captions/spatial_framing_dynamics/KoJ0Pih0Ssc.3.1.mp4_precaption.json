    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a mostly black-and-white scene, four stylized, glowing human figures are present. On the left, a white, glowing figure of a man is depicted mid-stride, with a posture suggesting he is running leftward, yet remains stationary. To the right, another white, glowing male figure is shown walking toward a large coil of barbed wire, but he too is still. In the middleground, positioned in the center of the path further down, two red, glowing male figures stand stationary, facing the viewer. All figures are depicted as luminous outlines without discernible facial features or clothing details.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is a stark, monochromatic depiction of an urban corridor at night under a dark sky. On the left, a high wall constructed from large concrete blocks extends into the distance. Opposite the wall stands a multi-story building with several windows. A long coil of concertina wire rests on the ground along the base of the building. Further down the street, two stationary, glowing red figures stand in the middle of the path, while two glowing white figures are posed as if in motion\u2014one running leftward and another walking toward the wire.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot captured at the subjects' level, the scene is framed with a concrete block wall on the left and a building on the right, both extending from the foreground into the background to form a corridor. A coil of barbed wire occupies the right foreground, stretching into the middle ground. In the left middle ground, a white figure is positioned mid-stride. A second white figure is in the right middle ground, posed near the wire. Further down the corridor, two red figures stand stationary in the center background. All elements remain static, creating a fixed composition with significant depth.",
