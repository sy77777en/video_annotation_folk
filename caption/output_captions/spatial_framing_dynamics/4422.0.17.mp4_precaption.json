    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with short, light brown hair is shown playing a drum kit. He is wearing a light blue suit, consisting of a jacket and matching trousers, over a white hooded sweatshirt with the hood up. He is seated at the silver and chrome drum kit, which has gold-colored rims and brass cymbals, and is captured in a dynamic pose with his right arm raised higher than his left hand, holding a drumstick. He has an intense facial expression as he plays.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a dark, flat rooftop overlooking a sprawling cityscape under a cloudy, overcast sky. Red brick chimneys rise from the roof's surface. In the background, a dense arrangement of buildings with varied architectural styles and rooftops stretches to the horizon, with a distant church steeple visible. Positioned in the center of the rooftop is a drum kit, which has a silver-colored finish on the main drums, a smaller gold-colored tom, and brass cymbals. A person in a light blue suit is seated at the kit, actively playing with their right arm raised higher than their left arm.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a man playing a drum kit, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The dark rooftop occupies the foreground and middle ground, with brick chimneys visible on the left. In the background, a cityscape stretches across the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. The shot then changes to a medium shot of the man.",
