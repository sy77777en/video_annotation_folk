    "pre_caption": "In a wide, overhead shot, a black SUV is positioned in the center-left of the frame, with a white police car to its right in the center-right. Both vehicles are in the middle ground, situated on a city street to the right of a central intersection. Buildings frame the scene at the top left, top right, and bottom of the screen. In the foreground, a text label reading \"PILOT CAR\" is at the bottom left, while another label reading \"ROUTE CAR\" is at the bottom right. As the shot progresses, both cars drive from right to left in a single file, moving through the intersection. The camera and the text labels remain stationary throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An aerial view shows two cars driving in a single file on a city street. Leading the way is a black SUV, identified by a white label with blue text that reads \"PILOT CAR.\" Following closely behind is a white police car, identified by a similar label that reads \"ROUTE CAR.\" The police car has blue \"NYPD\" lettering on its side and the number \"6005\" on its trunk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an overhead view of a city street intersection during the day. The gray asphalt roads are marked with white dashed lines and crosswalks. The intersection is flanked by multi-story buildings, one dark gray and another light gray, with a tan-colored building in the foreground. A black SUV and a white police car drive one after the other through the intersection. Text overlays are present on the screen. The label \"PILOT CAR\" in a blue box points to the black SUV, while the label \"ROUTE CAR\" in a blue box points to the police car.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
