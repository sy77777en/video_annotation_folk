    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit urban setting at night, a maroon taxi cab with an illuminated yellow \"TAXI\" sign on its roof and glowing headlights drives up a sloped street. To the left of the street, a portion of a light-colored, possibly yellow, older model car is parked. On the right, a light gray older model car is parked at an angle on the incline, with another dark-colored vehicle partially visible behind it. Buildings line both sides of the street; the one on the right features visible graffiti. In the distant background, the illuminated silhouettes of several skyscrapers define a city skyline.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is an urban alleyway at night, with a view of a distant city skyline featuring illuminated skyscrapers. A maroon taxi with a yellow \"TAXI\" sign on its roof drives up an incline in the center of the alley. On the left, a portion of a light-colored building is visible, with a parked, older model, light-colored car in front of it. To the right, a light gray, older model car is parked on an upward slope next to a light-colored building wall adorned with graffiti. The alley's surface is dark and paved, and the overall lighting is dim, primarily from a streetlight, the taxi's headlights, and the distant city lights.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures an urban alley at night. The dark, paved alley surface occupies the foreground and slopes upwards into the middle ground. A portion of a light-colored car is positioned in the left foreground. In the center of the middle ground, a maroon taxi, initially at the base of the incline, drives upwards, remaining centrally framed as it moves further into the middle ground. Light-colored buildings line both sides of the street in the middle ground; the building on the right features graffiti and has a light gray car parked beside it on the incline. The distant, illuminated city skyline is visible in the background, positioned in the upper center. The camera is at the subject's level.",
