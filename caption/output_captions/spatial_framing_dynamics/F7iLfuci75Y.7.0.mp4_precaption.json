    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A vast, organized array of disembodied, stylized white hands are shown actively typing on black keyboards. Each pair of smooth, matte-finished hands is positioned over a black, rectangular keyboard with teal-green backlit keys. In every instance, a black, modern computer mouse with matching teal-green accents sits to the side of a keyboard. The setups are arranged in a grid-like pattern, with each station illuminated by a circular spotlight against a completely dark background, creating the impression of an endless, uniform workforce.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a vast, dark, and abstract space, countless pairs of disembodied white hands are arranged in a grid pattern, extending into the distance. Each pair of hands is actively typing on a black keyboard with glowing teal keys. These workstations are individually illuminated by spotlights from above, creating circular pools of light on the dark, striped floor. Every keyboard has a computer mouse to its left. The scene is characterized by the synchronized, continuous motion of the typing hands. An overlay with white text appears at the bottom left corner, stating, \"[43].\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle, initially frames a single workstation in the foreground at the bottom center, featuring a pair of disembodied hands typing on a keyboard. Numerous identical workstations are arranged in a grid pattern, occupying the middle ground and background across the frame. As the camera slowly pulls back and up, the scene expands to an extreme wide shot, revealing a vast, seemingly endless field of these typing stations that recede into the top of the frame. Each station, composed of hands, a keyboard, and a mouse to its left, is isolated by a circular spotlight in the dark environment.",
