    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three men in a desolate, outdoor setting. Two of them are wearing dark military-style uniforms with helmets and face masks or guards, each holding a rifle. The man in the foreground, dressed in the uniform, appears to be gesturing with his left hand, while the other uniformed man is positioned in the background. The third individual is dressed in an orange hazmat suit with a helmet and visor, carrying a backpack and a device on his chest. He stands facing forward, seemingly observing the surroundings. The scene conveys a sense of caution and preparedness, with all three men equipped for a hazardous environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting in a desolate, barren landscape with sparse, leafless trees and a muted, overcast sky, suggesting a gloomy atmosphere. The ground is dark and uneven, possibly muddy. In the background, a vehicle is partially visible, blending into the somber environment. The time of day appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, characterized by dim, diffused lighting. Three figures in protective suits are present: two in dark gear and one in an orange hazmat suit. They are equipped with gear and moving amidst the bleak terrain. The scene conveys a sense of stillness and isolation, with no visible movement or activity beyond the figures' presence.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This video uses a medium full shot to frame three figures within a desolate landscape. In the center-right foreground, a man in dark military gear stands, gesturing. To his right, also in the foreground, is a man wearing an orange hazmat suit. Further back, in the left middle ground, another man in dark military gear holds a rifle. A vehicle is partially visible in the left background. The surrounding environment consists of dark, uneven ground in the foreground and middle ground, dotted with sparse, leafless trees, while hills form the background under a dim sky. The shot remains static, with no changes in framing or subject position. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
