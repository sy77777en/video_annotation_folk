    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up of a man situated in the foreground, primarily on the right side of the frame. He is seated, with his left side leaning against the right wall of a futuristic corridor, which is characterized by green-hued metallic panels and occupies the middle ground and background. The corridor's walls are visible on the left, right, and top of the frame, extending into the distance. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly zooms out, causing the man to appear slightly smaller within the frame and revealing marginally more of the surrounding corridor, while maintaining a medium close-up perspective. The camera remains positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged man with dark, slightly disheveled hair and a fair complexion is shown. He is wearing a dark blue, collared, button-up shirt over a white undershirt. A patch on the left side of his chest displays the letters \"ASA\" above the word \"WEIR.\" His eyes are wide, and his mouth is slightly agape, giving him a surprised or alarmed expression. He is seated, leaning to his left while holding an object in his hand. His right leg is bent, and his left leg is not visible in the frame, as he looks directly forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit, futuristic corridor with a green hue dominating the environment. The walls are lined with reflective, metallic panels that give the space a high-tech appearance. The corridor extends into the distance, creating a sense of depth and confinement. The lighting is low, casting subtle reflections and shadows across the surfaces, enhancing the sterile and mechanical atmosphere. A person is seated against the wall, wearing a dark uniform, adding to the industrial feel of the setting. The overall ambiance is one of tension and isolation, with the green lighting contributing to an otherworldly, technological vibe.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
