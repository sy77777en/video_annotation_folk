    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a black stick figure with a round head, a slender body, and disproportionately large, blocky black feet. The stick figure is depicted holding a simple, solid red ball.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile, shows a minimalist outdoor environment. The setting features a stark white background with a thin black horizontal line representing the ground. Small, sparse green scribbles, resembling blades of grass, are scattered along this ground line.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It appears to be a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a full shot, initially featuring a black stick figure in the center middle ground, holding a red ball in its right hand, also in the middle ground. A thin black horizontal line, representing the ground, is positioned at the bottom of the frame in the middle ground, with sparse green scribbles indicating grass scattered along it. The background is a plain white expanse. The red ball disappears from the stick figure's hand, and the figure then turns and walks towards the left side of the frame, moving from the center to the left-center, while remaining in the middle ground. It appears to be a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
