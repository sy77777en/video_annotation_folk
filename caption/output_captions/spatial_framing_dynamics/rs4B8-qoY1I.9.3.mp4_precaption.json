    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays an isometric view of a theme park, featuring several key elements. Prominent are wooden roller coasters with visible tracks, some accented with red and white, and trains carrying small, pixelated figures. Various buildings, constructed from wood and stone-like materials with grey or brown roofs, serve different functions, including ride stations. A chairlift system, with cables strung between tall, grey metal towers, transports people in individual chairs over the park. Numerous small, pixelated human figures, dressed in a variety of brightly colored clothing, are seen walking on brown dirt paths, queuing for attractions, and riding the various rides. The landscape is dotted with green trees of conical and rounded shapes, and a significant portion of the scene is occupied by a large body of turquoise water. Other park details include a drink stall located beside the dirt path, made from four cans\u2014two green and two red\u2014with a white lifebuoy incorporated into its design and situated on its roof.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows an amusement park environment in a three-quarters perspective. The scene features a large, wooden roller coaster with red and white tracks and extensive wooden support structures, winding through a forested area and over a large body of turquoise-colored water via a wooden bridge. Several wooden buildings with grey, sloped roofs are present; one serves as an entrance to a ride, and others appear to be stations or themed structures. A chairlift system with metal towers and red chairs transports small figures across the park, passing over a brown dirt path populated by numerous tiny figures. The landscape is characterized by green grassy areas and a variety of green trees, both coniferous and deciduous, bordering the water and the attractions. Roller coaster trains and chairlift cars are in motion, and people are visible walking along the paths.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot from a tilted overhead, isometric perspective. Initially, a wooden roller coaster with its station buildings is prominent in the center-right, its tracks extending to the top right and bottom left, all situated in the middle ground. A chairlift system, with cables and towers, runs from the bottom left towards the center-right in the middle ground, passing over a dirt path with small figures. A large body of turquoise water occupies the top left, top, and center-right portions of the frame, serving as a middle to background element, while green trees are distributed throughout the middle ground. The camera then pans left and slightly upwards, accompanied by a subtle zoom-out. This transition brings a roller coaster with red and white tracks to the forefront in the top left and center, alongside a large building in the center-left, both in the middle ground. The previously central wooden coaster elements shift to the right side of the frame, and a drink stall becomes visible in the bottom left during the pan. The consistent overhead, isometric viewpoint is maintained.",
