    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot, featuring the rider and dirt bike in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The grassy terrain is visible at the bottom of the frame, spanning the foreground and middle ground, while a dense wall of green bushes and trees occupies the top of the frame in the background, with a pale sky above. The camera is initially at the subject's level. As the rider moves from the center towards the top right of the frame, navigating the uneven terrain, the shot transitions to a wide shot, and the camera's perspective changes to below the subject, who remains in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, wearing a blue, white, and red helmet, a black chest protector featuring a colorful graffiti pattern on the back over a red and black long-sleeved jersey, red and black pants, and black boots, rides an orange and white dirt bike with a black seat. The rider, also wearing black gloves, is seen from the back and side as they navigate uneven, grassy terrain.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a grassy, uneven hillside during the daytime. The ground is covered with a mix of dry, light brown grass and patches of green, with a few scattered rocks. In the background, a dense thicket of vibrant green bushes and small trees forms a solid wall of foliage, with some taller, bare tree branches visible against a pale, overcast sky. A dirt bike rider navigates the terrain, moving across the slope.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to below the subject.",
