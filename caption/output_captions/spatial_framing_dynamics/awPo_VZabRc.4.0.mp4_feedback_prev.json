    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames an animated man in the center middle ground, seated at a light-brown counter that extends across the foreground. To his left and behind him, a large, translucent pink entity looms in the middle ground. In the left foreground, a pile of cards and keys rests on the counter. The entity's left arm, initially behind the man, extends forward over the counter toward the pile. The man, holding a pink wallet in his left hand, moves his right hand from the counter up to the side of his head. The camera remains stationary at the man's eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated man with a stylized, angular appearance has pale skin, intense dark eyes, and spiky black hair. He is dressed in a white t-shirt and a black jacket with a high collar. He holds an open pink wallet and looks down at it with a focused expression. Looming behind him is a large, translucent, glowing pink humanoid entity. This ghostly figure has two bright, glowing white eyes and an indistinct form with arms and a torso. At one point, a golden crown is visible on its head.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting bathed in a reddish-pink glow, a man with black hair sits at a light-brown counter. The counter, which stretches across the foreground, is cluttered with a pile of cards and keys. In the background, simple, dark tables are faintly visible. A large, translucent pink figure with glowing white eyes stands behind the man, its arm reaching over the counter towards the pile of items. The man, wearing a black jacket over a white shirt, holds an open pink wallet in his hand.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.",
