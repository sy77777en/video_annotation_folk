    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an expansive, aerial cityscape scenery shot of a stylized, 3D-rendered Paris, identifiable by the iconic Eiffel Tower in the background and dense blocks of Haussmann-style buildings. A massive, vibrant red structure, composed of hundreds of articulated bus sections, intricately weaves throughout the urban environment, looping over streets and around buildings. The tops of these bus sections are red, the bottoms are white, and there appears to be a wheel around the middle of each section. The structure is static and does not exhibit dynamic movement. There is no single main subject, as the camera's high-angle, sweeping view is designed to capture the grand scale and surreal atmosphere of the entire scene. The focus is on the juxtaposition of the historic city and the sprawling bus section structure, creating a unique and fantastical landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of a stylized representation of Paris, with the Eiffel Tower visible in the background against a hazy sky and distant mountains. The daytime scene is dominated by dense, Parisian-style city blocks with light-colored facades and blue-grey mansard roofs. A massive, intricate chain of hundreds of articulated bus sections weaves throughout the city, passing over streets and through building courtyards. Each bus section is red on top, white on the bottom, and appears to have a wheel in the middle underneath. An overlay in the top right corner displays the text \"ESC or START to end fly cam\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a stylized cityscape from a high-angle, aerial perspective. The scene is composed with the Eiffel Tower positioned in the background toward the top left, set against distant mountains. A massive, red, articulated structure dominates the foreground and middle ground, weaving intricately through the city blocks that fill the majority of the frame from bottom to top. A text overlay is visible in the top right corner. The camera remains completely stationary throughout the clip, maintaining its elevated viewpoint looking down upon the entire landscape.",
