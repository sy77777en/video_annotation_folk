    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Three male figures, rendered in a low-polygon animated style, are positioned on the bridge of a ship. The most prominent figure, a man with light-colored hair wearing a dark blue uniform and a matching captain's hat, stands in the center-right foreground with his back to the viewer. To his left, another man with light-colored hair and a similar blue uniform is seated at a control panel. A third man in a blue uniform stands on the far right, leaning toward the window while looking through a telescope. Through the windows, a large red and black ship is visible in the distance on the open sea. The video's focus initially rests on the distant ship before shifting to the back of the central standing figure, bringing him into sharp focus while blurring the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the scene is set on the bridge of a ship. The dimly lit interior features a control console with an illuminated screen, viewed from behind a figure in a blue uniform and cap. Through the large windows, a vast blue ocean with gentle waves stretches to the horizon under a cloudy daytime sky. In the distance to the left, a large red and black cargo ship is visible on the water. The scene is presented in a low-polygon animation style.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: Three polygonal navy soldiers stand in the ship\u2019s cockpit. The one on the left sits at the controls, the center figure stands gazing ahead, and the one on the right leans toward the window with a telescope. Through the bow window, the sea stretches out, with a distant ship in view. The camera looks forward from behind the foreground figure\u2019s shoulder, his upper body filling the right side of the frame. The camera initially focuses on a ship in the sea background, then shifts focus via rack focus to the figure in the foreground, leaving the background blurred. It ends with a medium close-up shot of the figure.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene is framed in an over-the-shoulder shot from the subject's level, with the upper body of a standing figure occupying the right foreground. To his left, another figure is seated in the left foreground at a control panel. A third figure is positioned in the right middle ground, leaning toward the window. Through the windows, the ocean fills the background, where a large ship is visible in the left background. The shot begins with the focus on the distant ship. A rack focus then occurs, shifting the focus from the background to the foreground, bringing the central standing figure into sharp detail while the background becomes blurred, effectively ending in a medium close-up on him.",
