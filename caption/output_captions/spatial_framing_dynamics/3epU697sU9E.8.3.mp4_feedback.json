    "pre_caption": "A high-angle full shot frames five men within a conference room. In the foreground on the left, a man in a military flight suit sits at a long table that extends diagonally from the bottom left toward the upper right. In the middle ground, three other men are seated along the same side of the table: a man in a suit and red tie is positioned in the left-center, another man in a green blazer is in the center, and a third man sits on the right, facing a CRT monitor. A fifth man stands in the background at the left-center of the frame. Rows of empty, tiered chairs are visible in the background, spanning the upper left and center. The camera remains static from its elevated position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a conference room, four men are seated at a long, light-colored table, while a fifth man stands in the background. In the foreground, a white-haired, fair-skinned man in a green military flight suit with patches on the sleeves sits looking to his right. Next to him, a fair-skinned man with short, graying brown hair, wearing a dark suit, a white shirt, and a red tie, also looks to the right with a focused expression. Further down the table, another fair-skinned man with gray hair, wearing a dark green blazer, is seated. At the far end of the table, a Black man with a mustache, wearing a dark suit, sits facing a large, beige CRT computer monitor. A man in a dark military-style uniform stands in the background behind the table.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within an indoor briefing room featuring dark green carpeting and neutral gray walls. A long, angular conference table with a light-colored top and a wooden border occupies the center of the room. On the table are several items, including papers, pencils, drinking glasses, and a glass pitcher of water. At the far end of the table, a bulky, beige CRT computer monitor is positioned. Several men are seated at the table, while another man in a uniform stands in the background. Behind them, rows of empty, purple-upholstered chairs are arranged in tiered levels against a wood-paneled wall.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
