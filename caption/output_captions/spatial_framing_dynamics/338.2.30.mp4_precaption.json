    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a woman in a maroon vest and white shirt, wearing glasses, seated at a table. She is holding an ice cream cone and appears to be enjoying it. Next to her is another woman with blonde hair, wearing a denim jacket, who is looking at her with a slight smile. The scene transitions to a man in a yellow shirt sitting at a different table, which is set with various dishes. He is facing the camera and smiling. The setting is a restaurant with ornate decor, featuring intricate patterns and a circular opening in the background. The transition between subjects occurs as the focus shifts from the women to the man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting within a restaurant featuring ornate, gold-accented decor and intricate wall designs. The shot opens on a lively dining scene, with several tables occupied by patrons engaged in conversation. Each table is dressed with white tablecloths, dishes, and napkins, contributing to the bustling, social atmosphere. As the camera pans from right to left, it transitions smoothly between scenes before settling on a round table in the foreground, set with a white tablecloth, pink napkins, and a variety of dishes, suggesting an ongoing meal. In the background, parts of the restaurant\u2019s interior come into view, including circular wall carvings and warm lighting that highlights the rich decor and red cushioned chairs.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a medium shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up shot of a woman in a maroon vest and white shirt, positioned in the left side of the frame and in the foreground. She holds an ice cream cone and is seated at a table. Another woman, wearing a denim jacket, is located to the right of the frame, also in the foreground. The camera then transitions to a medium shot of a man in a yellow shirt, who is centered in the frame and in the middle ground. This transition occurs as the focus shifts from the two women to the man. The man is seated at a different table, which is set with various dishes. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, capturing both scenes from a direct perspective. The background includes ornate decor and other diners, providing context to the restaurant setting. The camera does not change height during the transitions, maintaining a consistent viewpoint relative to the subjects.",
