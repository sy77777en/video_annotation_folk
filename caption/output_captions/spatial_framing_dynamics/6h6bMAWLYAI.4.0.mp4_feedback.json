    "pre_caption": "The scene is captured in a static medium shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. In the middle ground, four people are arranged behind a large, reflective desk that occupies the foreground and the bottom half of the frame. A woman is seated on the left, while a man, initially seated, stands up in the center-left, gesturing expansively with his hands in the space before him. To his right, another woman is seated in the center-right, and a third woman stands on the far right, leaning on the desk. The desk itself features a screen in the bottom center foreground displaying \"KTLA 5 NEWS\". In the background, a large screen shows an image of a baseball stadium. Overlays are present in the foreground, with a logo in the bottom left corner and another in the bottom right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a news studio setting, four people are positioned behind a large, reflective desk. In the center, a man with fair skin and short, dark brown hair stands wearing a dark suit, a light-colored shirt, and a tie, gesturing with both hands as if speaking. To his right, a woman with fair skin and shoulder-length blonde hair is seated, wearing a long-sleeved red top with shoulder cutouts. To the man's left, another woman with fair skin and long, dark brown hair is seated, wearing a sleeveless red dress and resting her chin on her hand while smiling. On the far left, a third woman with fair skin and dark, shoulder-length hair stands leaning against the desk, wearing a sleeveless red top and a dark skirt, gesturing with her hand that is not resting on the desk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a broadcast-style viewpoint used in television production, set within a modern news studio. In the center is a large, glossy, dark-colored news desk with a reflective surface, which has a screen on its front displaying \"KTLA 5 NEWS\" in blue and white text. The background consists of a large blue screen featuring an image of a baseball stadium with the \"Dodgers\" logo. Four people are around the desk; a man in a dark suit stands and gestures, while three women in red tops are either seated or standing around the desk. Various items, including laptops, mugs, and a smartphone, are placed on the desk. An overlay in the bottom left corner shows a circular black and white logo with the text \"IEST,\" and another overlay in the bottom right corner displays the \"KTLA\" logo.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The image shows a news studio scene with four people behind a desk. The three women are wearing red outfits, showing their upper bodies, while the man, dressed in a black suit, is visible from the thigh up. The desk covers their lower bodies, making them occupy less than 50% of the frame's height.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
