    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person perspective of an underwater scene, with the camera positioned at the diver's eye level, creating an immersive experience. In the initial frame, large rock formations dominate the middle ground, positioned centrally, while smaller glowing creatures float in the foreground, adding depth. The vibrant flora, illuminated in shades of green and blue, is scattered throughout the middle ground and background, enhancing the scene's complexity. As the video progresses, the diver's hands become visible in the foreground, moving gracefully, suggesting exploration. The spiky blue object is also partially visible in the foreground, indicating potential movement or discovery. The camera maintains a steady height, allowing for a clear view of the underwater landscape, while the overlay effect frames the scene, subtly obscuring the edges. The overall composition shifts slightly as the diver navigates through the environment, revealing more of the luminous flora and fauna in the middle ground and background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video immerses viewers in an underwater scene from a first-person perspective, simulating a diver's exploration. An overlay effect mimics the view through a diver's mask, with the frame's edges subtly obscured. The vibrant, otherworldly landscape features large, towering rock formations and pillars covered in luminescent flora, casting a soft glow in shades of green and blue. Small, glowing creatures or particles float gently through the water, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The diver's hands are visible, moving gracefully, enhancing the sense of exploration. In the foreground, a distinct, spiky, blue object or creature is partially visible, suggesting movement or discovery. The overall atmosphere is mysterious and serene, with the interplay of light and shadow creating a captivating visual experience.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, exploring an underwater environment. The setting is a vibrant, alien-like ocean floor, featuring towering rock formations and scattered coral structures. The scene is illuminated by bioluminescent marine life, casting a soft glow across the surroundings. Various aquatic plants and creatures, some glowing in shades of green and blue, add to the otherworldly atmosphere. The sandy seabed is dotted with patches of seaweed and small, luminescent clusters. The water is clear, allowing for a wide view of the underwater landscape. Overlay elements include a red framing at the top and bottom of the screen, suggesting a helmet or visor, enhancing the immersive experience.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
