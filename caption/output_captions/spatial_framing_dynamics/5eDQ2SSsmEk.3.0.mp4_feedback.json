    "pre_caption": "In an extreme close-up shot, the camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down upon a creased poster. Initially, the word \"Island\" is visible in the top right of the frame, with an illustration of a spaceship in the center and a futuristic building on the far left. The frame then slowly pans down and to the left across the poster's surface. This movement causes the word \"Island\" to move out of the top of the frame, while the text \"TICKETS STARTING FROM 100.000\u20ac\" enters the frame from the bottom and settles in the bottom left. Throughout the pan, the spaceship illustration shifts from the center to the top center, and the building illustration remains on the left side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up shot reveals a creased and weathered paper poster with a faded, yellowish-green and blue illustration. The artwork depicts a futuristic scene featuring a large, grey, blocky architectural structure on the left and a sleek, grey spaceship flying in the center over a blue, cloud-like expanse. The dark silhouettes of palm tree fronds are visible on the right. White, sans-serif text is printed on the poster; the word \"Islands\" appears in the upper right corner, and the phrase \"TICKETS STARTING FROM 100.000\u20ac\" is located in the lower left. The paper is visibly folded and worn, with white crease lines running across the artwork.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A close-up view reveals a creased and weathered paper printed with an advertisement. The illustration on the paper depicts a futuristic scene over a dark blue body of water. On the left, a large, complex structure stands, while a long, sleek spaceship flies towards the right. The fronds of a palm tree are visible in the lower right corner. The paper is marked with distinct white fold lines and has a faded, yellowed-green and blue color palette. Printed text is visible, with the word \"Island\" in the upper right and the phrase \"TICKETS STARTING FROM 100.000\u20ac\" along the bottom edge. The perspective slowly shifts across the surface of the worn document.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.",
