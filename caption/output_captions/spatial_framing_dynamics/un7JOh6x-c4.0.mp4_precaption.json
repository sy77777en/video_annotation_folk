    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a panoramic landscape scenery shot of a massive waterfall system. The camera slowly pans left, revealing an expansive, long cliff face from which dozens of individual waterfalls cascade down. The dark, reddish-brown rock of the cliff is interspersed with large vertical swathes of vibrant green vegetation, creating a striped pattern against the white, rushing water. A dense, lush green forest with various types of trees and foliage frames the scene from the foreground and extends across the top of the cliff. There is no main subject because the shot is designed to convey the immense scale and awe-inspiring beauty of the natural formation itself, focusing on the overall environment and the collective power of the falls rather than a specific object or entity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A panoramic view of Iguazu Falls reveals a vast series of waterfalls cascading down a wide, rocky cliff face during the daytime. The dark, reddish-brown cliffs are extensively covered in vibrant green moss and vegetation, creating a striped pattern against the white, flowing water. A lush, dense jungle with various trees populates the foreground and the area above the falls, where a wide river can be seen feeding the cascades. The camera slowly pans from right to left, showcasing the immense scale of the natural wonder.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video captures a wide shot of an expansive waterfall system, focusing on the scenery rather than a specific subject. Initially, the frame is dominated by dozens of waterfalls cascading down a long, vegetation-covered cliff face that stretches across the middle ground. A lush forest is positioned in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, with more forest and a river visible in the background along the top of the cliff. The camera slowly pans from right to left, revealing more of the waterfall system. This movement brings larger, more powerful sections of the falls into view on the left side of the frame, while the rightmost falls gradually exit the shot. The camera maintains a high-angle perspective, looking across at the falls from a distance.",
