    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a quiet residential street lined with modern houses and parked cars. The focus is on the environment, showcasing the architecture, street layout, and urban atmosphere rather than any specific object. The presence of utility poles, street signs, and greenery adds to the sense of everyday life in a suburban setting, emphasizing the scale and ambiance of the neighborhood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a quiet, narrow residential street in Japan during the daytime. The video pans slightly left, revealing more of the paved road ascending a gentle slope. Multi-story houses with balconies line both sides of the street, featuring beige and grey siding. Overhead utility lines crisscross above the road. On the right, a silver Subaru station wagon is parked in a paved driveway next to a house with some green shrubbery and a small white sign bearing Japanese characters. Further down the street on the left, a black car is parked, and a scooter is partially visible in the immediate foreground. The sky appears clear with some light clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot capturing a quiet residential street. Initially, the frame shows the street extending from the bottom left to the top right, with multi-story houses on both sides. The houses are positioned in the middle ground, with the street itself in the foreground. A silver Subaru station wagon is parked on the right side, in the middle ground, while a black car is visible further down the street on the left, also in the middle ground. Utility poles and overhead lines are positioned in the background, running parallel to the street. The camera is at street level, providing a first-person perspective. As the video progresses, the camera pans slightly to the left, revealing more of the street and the ascending slope. The spatial composition remains consistent, with the street and houses maintaining their positions relative to the frame.",
