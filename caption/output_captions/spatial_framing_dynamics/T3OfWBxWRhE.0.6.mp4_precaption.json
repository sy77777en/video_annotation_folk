    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is an architectural scenery shot capturing a grand, neoclassical building under a vast, cloudy sky. The symmetrical structure, made of light-colored stone, is defined by a central portico with imposing columns and two extensive wings lined with rectangular windows. Positioned in the middle ground is a tall, white cenotaph adorned with a carved wreath, standing before a wide staircase that ascends to the building's entrance. The absence of a specific main subject allows the focus to rest entirely on the impressive scale and stately atmosphere of the architectural environment. The composition emphasizes the building's grandeur and its role as a significant landmark rather than any individual element. The low, moving perspective further enhances the sense of scale and monumentality.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A daytime, moving shot captures the Auckland War Memorial Museum under an overcast sky. The large, symmetrical building, constructed from white stone in a Neoclassical style, appears light pink due to the camera's capture. It features a central portico with tall columns flanked by two wings with rows of windows. The museum is situated on a grassy incline, with a broad staircase ascending to the main entrance. In the plaza before the stairs stands a tall, rectangular stone cenotaph adorned with a carved wreath. The ground appears wet, and the camera's movement from a passing vehicle causes the immediate foreground to blur, creating a sense of motion past the grand structure.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle, moving perspective. A large building is centrally positioned in the middle ground, occupying the upper half of the frame, with a cloudy sky in the background. In front of the building, a wide staircase and a tall cenotaph are also located in the middle ground; the cenotaph is positioned in the center-right of the frame. The camera moves horizontally from left to right, causing a blurred surface in the immediate foreground to sweep across the bottom of the frame. Due to this motion, the cenotaph appears to shift slightly leftward relative to the stationary building behind it.",
