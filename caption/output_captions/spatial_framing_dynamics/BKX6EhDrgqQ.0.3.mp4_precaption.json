    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A row of white, self-ordering kiosks stands on a grey tiled floor inside a modern restaurant setting. Each kiosk features a large, vertical touchscreen display mounted on a black pole with a flat, rectangular base. Below the screen are slots for payment and receipts, and the McDonald's logo is visible. Some of the screens display an advertisement for a burger, while others show a blue background with the white text \"order & pay here.\" In the background, several grey, featureless, computer-generated figures representing people are seated in red booths and at white tables.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a modern and minimalist McDonald's restaurant. In the foreground, a row of white, self-service ordering kiosks stands on black poles, arranged on a light grey tiled floor. The vertical screens on the kiosks vary; some display an advertisement for a burger, while others show a blue screen with the white text \"order & pay here\" and the McDonald's logo. The dining area, furnished with red booths, white tables, and white chairs, is present in both the middleground and background. Grey, featureless figures are seated at some of the tables, representing customers.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed at the subjects' level, shows the interior of a modern restaurant. A row of self-ordering kiosks is arranged diagonally, beginning in the bottom left foreground and extending into the right middle ground. In the middle ground and background, red booths, white tables, and grey, featureless figures representing customers are visible behind the kiosks. The camera slowly pans to the right, causing the kiosks in the foreground to move toward the left of the frame while revealing more of the dining area in the background.",
