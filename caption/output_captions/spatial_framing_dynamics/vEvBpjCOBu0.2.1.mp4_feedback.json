    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a man in profile, positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. In the middle ground to the left, a vintage television is placed on a small table in the bottom-left corner. The camera, positioned at the man's level, slowly pushes in, transitioning the shot into a close-up that frames the man's head and shoulders more tightly, causing him to occupy more of the right side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with pale white skin and white hair is shown from the back and in profile, sitting in a dimly lit room. He wears a light gray hard hat and a brown jacket with a dark collar and a light-colored patch on the left shoulder. He is facing towards the left of the scene, looking in the direction of a vintage television set. The lighting is dramatic, illuminating the side of his face and body while the rest of the scene is mostly in shadow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, sparsely furnished room, a man wearing a hard hat and a brown work jacket is seated in profile, facing an old-fashioned television. The television rests on a small table draped with a white lace doily. The scene is dramatically lit, with a cool, pale light illuminating the man and the television from the front. Later in the video, a red light casts a glow on the man from the front. In the deep shadows of the background, a radiator and another table can be faintly discerned. On the right side of the scene, a lighter-colored protrusion is visible on the wall. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text \"[11]: Zeitzeugen-portal - 1955: Das Wirtschaftswunder (2011)\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
