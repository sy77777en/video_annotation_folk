    "pre_caption": "This medium shot frames a man's upper body in the center background, seated behind a wooden table that occupies the bottom third of the frame in the foreground. A red cup on a saucer is positioned in the center foreground on the table, with a black smartphone to its right. The man initially holds a cookie in the center of the frame, directly above the cup, before releasing it. The cookie falls vertically into the cup, and as it does, the man picks up the smartphone from the right foreground and holds it in the center, between himself and the cup. A splash of milk erupts upwards from the cup in the center foreground. The camera remains static and positioned at the subject's level throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark hair, a short beard, and black-rimmed glasses sits at a wooden table. He wears a grey t-shirt with a leaf pattern. In front of him, a red ceramic cup filled with white milk rests on a white saucer, next to a black smartphone. The man holds a chocolate chip cookie over the cup, drops it into the milk, and then picks up his phone to photograph the resulting splash. The video captures the cookie falling and the milk splashing upwards in a crown shape in slow motion.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a solid black background, a scene is set on a wooden table. In the center, a red ceramic cup filled with white liquid rests on a white saucer. A chocolate chip cookie is dropped into the cup, creating a large, detailed splash of liquid that is captured in slow motion. A black smartphone is also present on the table, held up to photograph the event.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: A cup sits on a large table in the foreground, while a person in the background is shown holding a phone, with only their upper body visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
