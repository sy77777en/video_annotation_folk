    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged, fair-skinned man with short brown hair, a receding hairline, a mustache, and a goatee stands on a wooden stage. He is wearing a light-colored button-down shirt, dark trousers, and a lanyard with an ID card. Behind him, a large projection screen shows a black-and-white photograph of a smiling young boy with light, wavy hair, alongside a color image of a vintage reel-to-reel tape recorder. The text \"11 Years-Old\" and \"Hypnopaedia\" is visible on the screen. To his right, a large white banner with the \"TEDx LingnanUniversity\" logo is displayed, and the same logo appears on a black lectern in the foreground. In the front row, the lower body of a person wearing dark trousers and shoes can be seen sitting with their legs crossed.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A man stands on a wooden stage in a lecture hall, delivering a presentation. To his right, a large white banner with red and black text reads \"TEDx LingnanUniversity\". Behind him, a large projection screen displays a slide featuring a black-and-white photograph of a young boy, an image of a vintage reel-to-reel tape recorder, and the word \"Hypnopaedia\". A lectern at the front of the stage also bears the \"TEDx LingnanUniversity\" logo. In the foreground, the backs of audience members are visible in tiered seating. The walls of the hall are covered in light-colored, grid-patterned panels.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A wide shot captures a man standing in the center of the frame on a stage in the middle ground. In the background, a large projection screen is positioned to the right, while a \"TEDx LingnanUniversity\" banner hangs on the wall to the left. In the foreground, the lower body of an audience member is visible in the bottom left, and a lectern with the same TEDx logo is situated in the bottom right. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
