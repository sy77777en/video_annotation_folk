    "pre_caption": "The scene is framed from a high-angle perspective. In the right middle ground, a large, pink, brain-like mass is positioned on a dark green base. To its left, in the central middle ground, is a dark green, spiky oval structure with a brightly glowing, yellow-green center. Further to the left, in the left middle ground, a dark red, irregularly shaped opening is visible, initially containing a black silhouette. A small, black, cat-like creature is then expelled from this red opening, moving towards the center-left of the frame while remaining in the middle ground. Simultaneously, three human-like figures are also ejected from the red opening; they move upwards and to the right, tumbling into the glowing center of the dark green oval located in the central middle ground. The cat-like creature continues to move in the area to the left of the green oval. The background consists of smaller, abstract organic shapes and glowing lines.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, pink, intricately textured organic mass, resembling a brain or fleshy growth, rests upon a dark green base with spiky protrusions. To its left is a prominent, dark green, oval-shaped object featuring purple spikes around its perimeter and a brightly glowing, yellow-green center. Further left, a dark red, irregularly shaped opening is visible, characterized by several yellowish-white, fang-like protrusions pointing inwards. A small, black, silhouetted creature with pointed ears and a tail, akin to a cat or demon, is expelled from the red opening simultaneously with three human-like figures, dressed in dark jackets and pants, who appear to be falling or tumbling; one of these figures has a white pentagram symbol on their back. While the human-like figures are thrown into the dark green oval, the cat-like demon continues to move and crawl outside, remaining near the opening.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a vibrant and abstract, otherworldly environment, rendered in a palette of intense pinks, purples, greens, and reds, with neon-like outlines. Large, organic, and unusual forms populate this space. Prominently, a substantial, brain-like, pinkish-red mass sits on a dark green base from which dark tendrils extend downwards. Nearby, a large, spiky, dark green and purple oval structure features a bright, yellow-green, glowing center. To the left, a reddish, irregularly shaped opening is visible, distinguished by yellowish-white, tooth-like protrusions along its inner edge. The background is filled with smaller, floating organic shapes and crisscrossing thin, glowing lines of yellow, pink, and blue. A small, black, cat-like silhouette navigates this landscape, moving away from the reddish opening, while other indistinct figures are briefly observed tumbling or being drawn towards the spiky oval structure.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
