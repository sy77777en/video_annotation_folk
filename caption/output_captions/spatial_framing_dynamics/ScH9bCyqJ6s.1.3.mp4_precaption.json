    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up shot shows a light-skinned hand holding a dark purple smartphone. The thumb of this hand is positioned over the bottom of three vertically aligned camera lenses. A second light-skinned hand holds a utility knife with a blue, textured handle and a silver metal body. The blade of the knife is extended and is being scraped across the glass surfaces of the top and middle camera lenses on the phone. The camera lenses are circular and set within black rings. A small, circular flash is visible to the right of the top camera lens.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A top-down shot shows a close-up of a person's hands on a white surface. One hand holds a dark purple smartphone, displaying its back panel which features a vertical arrangement of three camera lenses with black rings. The other hand holds a blue and silver utility knife, with the blade being pressed against the glass of the top and middle camera lenses. In the background, several colorful plastic prying tools are visible, along with a white paper bearing the partial text \"yRigEverything.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a close-up, top-down shot, a dark purple smartphone is held in the middle ground, positioned in the center-right of the frame. A left hand enters from the bottom left, its fingers in the foreground, with its thumb resting on the phone's bottom camera lens. From the top right, a right hand in the foreground holds a utility knife. The knife's blade moves from the top right toward the center, scraping across the surface of the top and then the middle camera lenses, which are arranged vertically on the phone in the middle ground. In the background, colorful tools are visible in the top left, and a piece of paper is in the top right.",
