    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a stark, black and white landscape scenery shot of a coastal environment in what appears to be winter. The camera's perspective is from a high vantage point on a snow-covered sand dune, looking down a path that leads towards the ocean. Dark, leafless, and thorny bushes in the foreground frame the view on both the left and right sides, guiding the eye towards the wide, flat beach and the calm sea beyond. The focus of the shot is on the overall desolate and quiet atmosphere of the environment, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape and the moody, overcast sky rather than a specific main subject. The composition uses the natural lines of the dunes and bushes to create a sense of depth and draw the viewer into the cold, serene scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a black and white outdoor scene, the perspective is from a sand dune looking out towards the ocean. Dark, leafless bushes on either side of the foreground frame a path that descends through the dunes. In the middle ground, small patches of short grass are scattered on both the right and left sides. This path opens onto a wide, flat beach marked with patterns from the wind. In the distance, the ocean stretches out under a solid grey, overcast sky, with gentle waves forming horizontal lines on the water's surface.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static wide shot of a coastal landscape. In the foreground, dark, leafless bushes are positioned on the bottom left and bottom right, framing the view. A snow-covered path begins at the bottom center and leads through the middle ground towards a wide, flat beach that occupies the horizontal center of the frame. In the background, the ocean stretches across the upper-middle portion of the frame, with an overcast sky filling the top. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down from a dune towards the sea.",
