    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged, light-skinned woman with short, brown hair stands on a stage, giving a presentation. She is wearing a sleeveless, black, knee-length dress and black, knee-high boots. Positioned on a red carpet, she gestures with her hands as she speaks, facing slightly to her left. Directly behind her, a large screen features the red \"TEDx\" logo and white text, while another screen to her back-right displays a live video feed of her delivering the speech. The stage is branded with \"TEDx\" in red and \"Vancouver\" in large white letters. A dimly lit, seated audience is faintly visible in the middle ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a brightly lit stage at a TEDx Vancouver event. A woman stands on a rectangular red carpet placed on a raised platform. The backdrop consists of a large screen displaying a blue geometric pattern and the \"TEDx Vancouver\" logo. Three large red spheres hang from the ceiling above. A large video screen above the stage shows a live feed of the speaker, while another screen to the far right displays the TEDx logo. The stage is illuminated with blue and white lights, contrasting with the dark, dimly lit audience area visible to the left.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A wide shot frames a woman standing in the center-right foreground on a red carpet, which is placed on a raised stage. In the middle ground, the \"TEDx Vancouver\" logo is positioned to the center-left, while a dimly lit audience is visible on the far left. The background is dominated by a large screen in the center-right, directly behind the speaker, which shows a live feed of her. Another screen displaying the TEDx logo is in the top right background, and three red spheres hang from the ceiling in the top left. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
