    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video displays a pixel art golf game featuring a player character with short brown hair, wearing a green shirt and brown pants. The game's user interface is also rendered in a pixelated style, with indicators for the hole number, par, distance, and wind. A club selection shows the name \"PUDDLE WEDGE,\" and a power meter is present at the bottom of the screen. At one point, the large, stylized words \"CHIP IN BIRDIE\" appear in purple and green pixelated text.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases a pixel-art golf course from an oblique top-down view, enhancing the visual experience. The scene features a green fairway and a putting green with a red flag in the hole, surrounded by trees and a sand trap. A body of water is visible on the left, and a dirt path runs along the bottom. A pixelated golfer on the green swings their club, sending the ball into the hole. The scene includes numerous overlay elements: in the top left corner, text indicates \"2ND\", \"PAR 4 363.3Y\", and the player's score \"E 3RD\"; in the top center, a distance marker to the pin is displayed; in the top right, a wind indicator shows \"3Y\". On the left, a \"NORMAL\" power bar and a club selection labeled \"RUTTER PUDDLE WEDGE\" are visible. At the bottom, a power meter shows \"16Y\", and on the right, a golf ball icon is labeled \"FAIRWAY 0Y RANGE\". After the ball goes in the hole, the words \"CHIP IN BIRDIE\" appear in large, colorful text in the center of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is captured in an extreme wide shot from an oblique top-down perspective. In the middle ground, a pixelated player character stands in the center of the frame on a putting green, with the hole and flag positioned slightly above them. The golf ball travels from the player's position toward the hole. Surrounding the central green are trees in the top and right middle ground, a sand trap to the left, and a body of water on the far left. A dirt path runs across the foreground at the bottom of the frame. Various user interface elements are overlaid in the foreground: information panels are in the top-left and top-right corners, a club selection is on the left edge, a power meter is at the bottom center, and a ball icon is in the bottom-right corner. As the ball approaches the hole, a distance counter in the top center of the frame decreases. After the ball lands in the hole, large text reading \"CHIP IN BIRDIE\" appears in the center of the frame, overlaying the player character.",
