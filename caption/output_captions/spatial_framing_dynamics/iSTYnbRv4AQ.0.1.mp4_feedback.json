    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot with no main subject, focusing on the dynamic movement through an urban environment. The video presents a wide shot looking down a city street, framed by multi-story buildings on the left and right that recede into the background, with another building visible in the center background. The street occupies the bottom and center of the frame, with blurred scooters in the foreground and indistinct pedestrians scattered across the middle ground. The camera, positioned at roughly eye level, moves forward rapidly in a time-lapse, creating intense radial motion blur on the periphery while the center remains more focused. As the camera advances, the flanking buildings and pedestrians sweep from the middle ground past the camera, and the perspective shifts slightly to the right, bringing the buildings on the right side closer to the center.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot that captures the dynamic energy of a European city street at dusk. There is no main subject because the rapid, forward-moving perspective and significant motion blur render individual people and vehicles indistinct, instead emphasizing the overall atmosphere and scale of the urban environment. The scene is characterized by classic, multi-story stone buildings lining a wet street, with blurred figures of pedestrians and scooters creating a sense of bustling activity against the backdrop of a fading sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse perspective travels down a wide European city street at dusk. The wet pavement reflects the pale light of the twilight sky. On either side of the street stand multi-story, classical-style stone buildings. Numerous pedestrians, appearing as blurred shapes due to the time-lapse effect, are visible walking along the street and sidewalks, where some scooters are parked. The forward movement creates a dynamic effect, with the periphery of the view heavily blurred while the center remains more defined.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
