    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a skateboarder captured in a full shot, showcasing him from the side as he navigates a curved sidewalk adjacent to a red brick building. The skateboarder is wearing a white cap, a brown short-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, and white sneakers. His dynamic posture and skillful control are evident as he balances on the skateboard. The camera follows his movement closely, maintaining a consistent distance to keep him centered in the frame. As he approaches a ramp, he jumps over the handrails, demonstrating impressive agility. The background includes urban elements such as a brick wall, a black door, and parked vehicles, which remain static throughout the sequence.\n\nThe camera then transitions to a view from behind the skateboarder as he accelerates past the camera's pace. This shift in perspective emphasizes his speed and the fluidity of his movements. The skateboarder continues to showcase his skills, maintaining balance and control as he glides through the urban environment. The background now includes a parking lot area with various vehicles, including vans and cars, parked neatly. The sky remains clear, casting defined shadows on the ground, indicating fair weather and bright daylight.\n\nThroughout the video, the camera maintains a consistent height relative to the skateboarder, keeping him at eye level.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins by capturing a man skateboarding from the side before transitioning to a view from behind as he accelerates beyond the camera's pace. He is wearing a white cap, a brown short-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, and white sneakers. The man showcases his dynamic posture and skillful control as he balances on the skateboard. A highlight of his skateboarding activity is when he jumps over the ramp handrails, demonstrating impressive agility. The setting includes urban elements like a brick wall and parked vehicles, but the focus remains on the man's impressive skateboarding maneuvers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor suburban setting during the day, featuring a skateboarder navigating a city-like environment. The scene unfolds along a sidewalk adjacent to a red brick building with visible vents and a black door. The skateboarder moves smoothly, transitioning from the sidewalk to a parking lot area, where vehicles like vans and cars are parked. The sky is clear, indicating fair weather, and the bright daylight casts defined shadows on the ground. The environment is characterized by elements such as street signs and concrete surfaces. Overlay elements serve as a framing component, enhancing the visual context without being intrusive, and are positioned unobtrusively to provide additional context without obstructing the view of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
