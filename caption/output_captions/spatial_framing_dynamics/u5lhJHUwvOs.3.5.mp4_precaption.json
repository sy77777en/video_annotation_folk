    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with short, bleached blonde hair and black-rimmed glasses stands looking down. He is dressed in a dark blue long-sleeved shirt, black shorts, and black socks. In his right hand, he holds a light blue and black racket. His attire is revealed from top to bottom, ending on his lower legs and feet, which are in black athletic shoes with white and orange details. He has tanned skin and a visible scar on his right shin.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a brightly lit squash court with a light-colored wooden floor marked by two red lines. A textured, light-gray wall serves as the backdrop. A person holding a squash racket stands on the court, and the view tilts downward from their upper body to their feet, which are positioned on the wooden surface near the red lines.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a person looking down. The camera then tilts downward, capturing his entire body and the tennis racket in his hand, before stopping at a close-up of his calves and shoes.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium close-up of a person positioned in the center-left of the frame, set against a textured wall in the background. The camera then tilts downward, transitioning to a medium shot that reveals the person's torso, shorts, and a racket held in their right hand. The tilt continues, concluding with a close-up focused on the person's lower legs and shoes, which are now centered in the frame. In this final composition, the wooden floor and its red lines occupy the foreground and middle ground, while the textured wall remains in the background.",
