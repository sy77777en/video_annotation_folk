    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a clear glass mug filled with a layered coffee beverage, positioned centrally on a dark countertop. The mug, featuring a handle and a small red label, is in the foreground, while the background consists of blurred shelves or cabinets, suggesting an indoor setting. Initially, the camera is positioned above the mug, capturing the entire drink and its distinct layers. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing more closely on the mug and its contents, with the camera moving to the subject's level. This change in perspective emphasizes the visual appeal of the layered drink. Towards the end, the shot returns to a full view, with the camera again positioned above the mug, maintaining focus on the beverage while the background remains softly blurred.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a clear glass mug filled with a layered coffee beverage, likely a latte, characterized by distinct layers of milk foam, coffee, and milk. The mug has a handle and a small red label on its side with black text that appears to read \"NacRom.\" The beverage is topped with a small amount of foam, and the glass is positioned on a dark countertop. The focus on the mug and its contents highlights the visual appeal of the layered drink.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting, likely a kitchen or caf\u00e9, featuring a glass mug filled with a layered coffee drink. The mug is placed on a dark countertop, and the drink displays distinct layers of milk and coffee, topped with frothy foam. The glass has a small red emblem on its side. The background includes a blurred view of shelves or cabinets, suggesting a warm, cozy environment. The lighting is soft, indicating an ambient indoor light source, with no specific time of day discernible. The scene remains focused on the drink, with a slight change in focus towards the end, maintaining the overall warm and inviting atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects initially, then changes to a medium shot of the subject, and back to full shot at the end.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
