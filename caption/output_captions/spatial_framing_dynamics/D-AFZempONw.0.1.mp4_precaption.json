    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A slender man with pale, mottled skin is shown wearing a metallic mask that covers most of his face, including a white section around his open mouth and eyes. He is restrained by a shackle around his chest and upper back. A large apparatus is attached to his back, from which numerous thick, ribbed tubes extend. These tubes initially appear gray, transition to a glowing neon green, and then revert back to gray, with an additional connection in the middle. Four tubes converge at the top of his head, and one tube extends from each shoulder. His arms are covered near the elbows with large black devices.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor space, bathed in a reddish-pink glow, an individual stands out, carrying a large, complex dark apparatus on his back. This apparatus is characterized by a cluster of thick, ribbed tubes that extend from it, attaching to the man's head and shoulders. Initially dark gray, these tubes begin to pulse with a bright, neon-green light. The metal surfaces of the apparatus, along with an attached mask and a shackle running across the chest and upper back, display a weathered texture, reflecting the ambient green and pink lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot centered on a large apparatus with gray, ribbed tubes attached to a figure's back, which occupies the center and right of the frame. The camera then pans down and to the right, transitioning to a medium close-up shot. This movement reveals a man in a metallic mask in the center-left foreground, with his head angled toward the right. As the camera moves, the tubes, which extend from the apparatus over his shoulders and head, begin to glow green, occupying the center and right portions of the frame. The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space with a reddish-pink glow in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
