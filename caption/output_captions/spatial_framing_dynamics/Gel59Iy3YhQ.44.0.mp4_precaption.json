    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pixelated, humanoid character is depicted wearing attire resembling warrior armor, featuring a long, bright red coat with yellow trim and cuffs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video captures a scene set at night high atop a dark, metallic tower-like structure. In the background, a large full moon is partially visible behind the structure's scaffolding, set against a swirling, greenish-blue nebula in a starry sky above dark purple clouds. The scene, rendered in a pixel art style, features large chains hanging down the center of the tower. A character moves from a small, suspended platform to a wider bridge where a glowing blue potion rests. Overlays are present, including a health bar and ability icons at the bottom left, and a minimap at the bottom right, along with various in-game counters for currency and time.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot opens with a pixelated character positioned in the top center of the frame, standing on a small platform in the middle ground. The character is framed by a dark tower structure in the foreground and middle ground, with a large moon and a green nebula visible in the background. The character drops down from the platform, and the camera pans down to follow, landing on a wider bridge below. The character then moves to the right, and the camera pans right to keep them in the center of the frame, stopping as they approach a blue potion on the right side of the bridge. Throughout the video, UI elements remain fixed in the foreground at the bottom left and bottom right of the screen, and the camera maintains a position level with the character.",
