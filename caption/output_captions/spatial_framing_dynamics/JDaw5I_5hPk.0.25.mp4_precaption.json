    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a forest scenery shot from the first-person perspective of someone walking across a long suspension bridge high up in a dense canopy of towering, thick-trunked trees. The bridge features a narrow wooden plank walkway, flanked on both sides by high, woven rope netting that serves as a railing. In the distance, other wooden platforms and smaller connecting bridges can be seen built around the massive trees, forming an extensive treetop walkway. There is no main subject in this shot; instead, the focus is on conveying the immersive experience and the grand scale of the forest environment from an elevated viewpoint. The camera's steady forward motion along the bridge draws the viewer into the scene, emphasizing the atmosphere of being suspended amidst the ancient trees.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A narrow suspension bridge with a wooden plank walkway and sides made of thick, light-colored rope netting extends forward into a dense forest. The bridge connects elevated wooden platforms built around the massive, dark trunks of tall coniferous trees. The surrounding forest is filled with lush green foliage, and the scene is illuminated by soft, diffused daylight filtering through the high canopy.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide scenery shot is framed from a first-person perspective, positioned at the height of a suspension bridge. The bridge originates at the bottom of the frame in the foreground and extends toward the center of the middle ground. Its woven rope railings on the left and right sides create leading lines that draw the eye forward. Tall trees populate the middle ground and background, flanking the bridge on both sides. In the middle ground, other wooden platforms are visible built around the trees, with one to the left and another directly ahead in the center. The camera moves steadily forward along the bridge, causing the destination platform in the center to appear closer while the foreground elements recede.",
