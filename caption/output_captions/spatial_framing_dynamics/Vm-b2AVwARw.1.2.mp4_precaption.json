    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a modern urban environment from a high vantage point. The focus is on the expansive view of the city, with sleek, tall skyscrapers stretching into the sky, reflecting the soft hues of a setting or rising sun. The scene includes a spacious balcony with contemporary furniture, such as cushioned chairs and a small table, which adds to the luxurious and serene atmosphere. The emphasis is on the vastness and architectural beauty of the cityscape, rather than any specific object, highlighting the environment and scale of the urban landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A view from a modern, high-rise balcony shows a stylized cityscape at sunset. The balcony features a smooth, light-colored floor and is partially covered by a dark, curved ceiling, with large glass panels offering an expansive view. Two modern-style chairs with gold-colored bases and dark, textured seats are arranged with a small, matching gold table. Outside, a collection of simple, light-colored skyscrapers rises from the landscape below, casting long shadows in the warm, late-afternoon light. The sky transitions from blue to pink near the horizon, with a few clouds visible. An overlay in the top right corner displays the text \"Animations are for illustrative purposes only. The final building may differ.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot of a modern balcony overlooking a cityscape. The foreground is occupied by the balcony floor in the bottom half of the frame, with two chairs and a small table positioned in the center-right. The background, seen through large glass panels on the left, consists of a stylized cityscape under a partly cloudy sky. A dark, curved ceiling frames the top of the shot, and a text overlay is visible in the top right corner. The camera, positioned at the height of the furniture, slowly pushes forward and pans slightly to the right, causing the cityscape view to shift and bringing the furniture more into focus.",
