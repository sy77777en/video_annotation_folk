    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from a high-angle perspective, captured from a moving elevated train. Initially, the view is framed by out-of-focus station architecture in the foreground, looking down at a building with a central, vertical red neon sign in the middle ground. As the camera moves forward, the perspective opens up to reveal a long street canyon stretching into the background, with tall buildings occupying the left and right sides of the frame. Station signs for \"Washington/Wabash\" and \"Millennium Park\" briefly appear in the left foreground and middle ground before moving out of the shot. The red neon sign, initially centered, shifts to the right side of the frame as the train progresses, while the view remains partially framed by the train's window and structural elements in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features a moody cityscape scenery shot from the perspective of a moving elevated train, likely Chicago's \"L\". The camera looks down a street canyon flanked by tall, classic-style buildings under an overcast sky, which casts a greenish, desaturated light over the scene. As the train moves forward, a vertical red neon sign on a building and station signage for \"Washington/Wabash\" and \"Millennium Park\" come into view, while traffic, including a trolley, can be seen on the street below. There is no main subject in this shot; instead, the focus is on the urban environment and atmosphere. The moving perspective is used to immerse the viewer in the scale and feeling of the city, emphasizing the journey through the architectural landscape itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From the perspective of a moving elevated train, the scene unfolds within a dense urban environment under dim, overcast lighting. The journey begins by passing through a station, revealing a view down a street canyon formed by tall, multi-story buildings with numerous windows. A green sign for the \"Washington Wabash\" station and a blue sign for \"Millennium Park\" are briefly visible. On the street below, there is light traffic. A vertical red neon sign adorns the facade of one of the buildings. The overall color scheme is muted, with a prominent greenish-grey cast over the cityscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
