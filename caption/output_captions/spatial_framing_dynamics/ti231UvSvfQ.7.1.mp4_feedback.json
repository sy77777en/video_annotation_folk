A person lies in a hospital bed positioned in the center-left middle ground, while a man sits in a chair to the right, also in the middle ground.

A white curtain is visible on the left, and a small lamp stands on a table on the right, both in the middle ground, set against the plain walls of the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit room, a bald person with pale skin lies still on their back in a hospital bed, covered to the chest by a white blanket. Their eyes are closed, and a watch is visible on their left wrist. Seated in a chair next to the bed is a young man with fair skin and short, light-colored hair. He is wearing a dark blue sweatshirt and is looking down at a file folder resting on his lap.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a dimly lit, spartan room at night. A person lies still in a hospital bed with a metal frame, covered by a white blanket. To the right of the bed, a second person sits in a chair, holding a file folder on their lap. The room's primary illumination comes from a white light at the top of the frame, with additional light from a small gooseneck lamp on a bedside stand, which casts a warm, focused glow. The background consists of plain, light-colored walls, a white curtain on the left, and wall-mounted equipment. The overall visual style is monochromatic and desaturated.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
