    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's level. A woman on a yellow surfboard occupies the center foreground, viewed from behind, with the board extending from the bottom of the frame toward the middle. To her left in the foreground, the nose of a white surfboard is visible. In the middle ground to the right, a man stands on his own surfboard. A city skyline stretches across the background of the frame. The camera, mounted on the woman's board, moves forward through the water, while another surfboard briefly passes from right to left in the middle ground, creating a splash.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a woman with light skin and long blonde hair, viewed from behind. She is wearing a dark-colored bikini top and bright yellow bikini bottoms. She is standing on a yellow surfboard, with her arms held out to her sides for balance. In the middle ground, a man with light skin, wearing a black short-sleeved shirt and black shorts, is also standing on a surfboard. The blue and white surfboard in the middle ground belongs to him, while a white surfboard is visible in the water to the left of the woman.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The camera is securely mounted on the yellow surfboard, providing a stable and immersive perspective as it moves through the ocean. The scene unfolds on a sunny day under a blue sky with white clouds, with a city skyline of numerous high-rise buildings lining the coast of Waikiki in the background. The greenish-blue water features white foam and small waves as the board glides forward, and another person on a different surfboard is visible nearby.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
