    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a male badminton player in slow motion. Initially, the focus is on his lower body, revealing black athletic shorts, white socks, and bright yellow athletic shoes. As the player jumps, the perspective shifts to show his upper body, dressed in a red polo shirt with white trim on the collar and sleeves. He is captured mid-air, holding a badminton racket, in the process of preparing to hit a shuttlecock.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set on an indoor badminton court with a green playing surface marked by white boundary lines and \"YONEX\" branding. In the background, a prominent blue advertising hoarding displays a \"RedBull\" logo, featuring two red bulls and a yellow sun, alongside white text that includes \"China Construction Bank\" and other inscriptions. The court area is brightly illuminated, contrasting with the dimly lit spectator areas further back. A badminton player, wearing a red polo shirt, black shorts, and bright yellow athletic shoes, is seen on the court, captured in an upward jumping motion while actively swinging a racket. The camera tilts upwards, following the player's movement.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a slow-motion sequence of a male badminton player. It opens with a close-up shot of his legs and feet as he jumps. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning to a medium shot that captures his upper body and arms mid-jump as he prepares to hit the shuttlecock.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a slow-motion sequence of a male badminton player. It opens with a close-up shot of his legs and feet, which are positioned in the center foreground as he jumps. The green court surface with white lines and \"YONEX\" branding occupies the middle ground, extending from the bottom of the frame. In the background, a blue advertising hoarding with a \"RedBull\" logo and \"China Construction Bank\" text spans the width of the frame. As the player jumps upwards, the camera tilts upward, following his movement. This action transitions the view to a medium shot, capturing his upper body and arms mid-jump, still in the center foreground. His badminton racket is also in the foreground. Consequently, the blue hoarding shifts to a lower position in the background, and a dimly lit spectator area becomes visible in the far background above it. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
