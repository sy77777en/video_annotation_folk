    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot of a majestic mountain valley under a clear, star-filled night sky. Towering, snow-covered mountains flank a dark, still body of water that reflects the celestial light. The scene is dramatically lit, with cool moonlight illuminating the rugged slopes on one side of the valley, while the other side remains in deep shadow. A small, warm artificial light in the foreground provides a subtle contrast to the vast, cold wilderness. There is no main subject; instead, the focus is on the immense scale, serene atmosphere, and breathtaking beauty of the natural environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This is a nighttime scene of a snow-covered mountain valley under a clear, dark blue sky filled with stars. Two large mountain ranges, their slopes covered in white snow, form a V-shape, framing a dark, still body of water in the center. The water reflects the starlight and the dark silhouettes of the mountains. The snow is illuminated, creating a stark contrast between bright surfaces and deep shadows. In the foreground, a patch of snow on the right is cast in a warm, yellowish light.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static, extreme wide shot of a mountain valley landscape. The scene is framed by two large, snow-covered mountain ranges in the middle ground, with one occupying the left side of the frame and the other occupying the right. Together, they form a V-shape that directs the view toward the center, where a body of water is situated in the middle ground, and more distant mountains are visible in the background. The top of the frame is filled by a starry sky in the background. In the bottom right foreground, a patch of snow is visible. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down into the valley.",
