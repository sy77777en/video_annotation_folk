    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a nighttime cityscape scenery shot, featuring a quiet, empty road illuminated by a series of evenly spaced streetlights that cast pools of light onto the pavement and sidewalk. The darkness of the sky and the absence of vehicles or pedestrians emphasize the stillness and solitude of the urban environment, while the gentle curve of the road and the subtle glow from the lamps create a sense of depth and calm. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is on capturing the tranquil atmosphere and expansive emptiness of the city at night rather than highlighting any specific object or individual.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a quiet, empty road at night, bordered by low concrete barriers on both sides. On the side nearest to the camera, there is a grassy area situated along the inside of the barrier. The scene is illuminated by a series of evenly spaced streetlights that cast pools of white light onto the wide asphalt road, creating a stark contrast with the surrounding darkness. A speed limit sign with a white background and black markings is visible on the right side of the road, mounted on a slender pole. The sky is completely black, with no visible stars or clouds, and the overall environment appears still, with no vehicles or pedestrians present. The road surface is smooth and slightly reflective under the streetlights, and there are no notable overlays or visual effects present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture a nighttime cityscape with no main subject, focusing on the empty road and its surroundings. The road curves gently from the bottom left of the frame toward the center and then recedes into the background, occupying the foreground and middle ground. Low concrete barriers run along both sides of the road, with the left barrier and adjacent grassy area positioned in the bottom left foreground. Evenly spaced streetlights extend from the bottom left to the upper center background, creating a line of illuminated pools that emphasize the road\u2019s depth. A speed limit sign is visible on the right side of the road, positioned in the middle ground near the right edge of the frame. The camera is set at approximately road level, parallel to the surface, providing a neutral height that maintains a clear, expansive view of the scene. There are no notable spatial movements or changes in framing throughout the shot.",
