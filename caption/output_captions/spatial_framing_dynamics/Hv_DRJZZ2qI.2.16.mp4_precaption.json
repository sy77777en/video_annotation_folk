    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a person riding a black mountain bike down a steep, rocky, reddish-brown hillside. The rider wears a yellow and black long-sleeved jersey, black pants, and a matching yellow and black full-face helmet. They are shown launching off a dirt ramp and flying through the air. A crowd of spectators, composed of men and women in casual attire like t-shirts, shorts, and hats, watches from a lower vantage point. Some members of the crowd are holding up phones, appearing to film the event. Near the top of the hill, a large blue flag with a red bull logo is planted in the ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a steep, reddish-brown, rocky hillside in a desert canyon during the day. The arid terrain is dotted with sparse green bushes and shrubs. A narrow, dusty path winds down the incline, where a mountain biker is seen descending and launching into the air off a dirt jump. A crowd of spectators is gathered on various ledges and vantage points along the hillside, observing the action. Near the top of the course, a large blue flag is planted in the ground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is presented as an extreme wide shot, with a mountain biker initially positioned in the top left of the frame, in the middle ground on a steep hillside. A blue flag is also located in the top left, in the middle ground. In the foreground, a crowd of spectators occupies the bottom of the frame. As the biker descends, they move diagonally from the top left towards the center, launching into the air. The camera, positioned below the subject, pans right and tilts up to track the biker's movement through the air.",
