    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a top-down view of a road with multiple vehicles. A central white truck is surrounded by several green military vehicles, which are positioned both in front and behind the truck. The vehicles are evenly spaced along the road, suggesting a convoy formation. The scene is set in a desert-like environment, with the road cutting through the barren landscape. The military vehicles are distinct due to their green color and boxy shape, typical of armored transport. The truck is larger and more rectangular, standing out due to its white color. The arrangement and movement of the vehicles imply a coordinated travel or escort scenario.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, filmed by a drone, captures an aerial view of a straight, four-lane road with two lanes in each direction, cutting through a barren desert landscape. The setting is outdoors, with the road flanked by sandy terrain dotted with sparse vegetation. The time of day appears to be daytime, as indicated by the lighting. Vehicles, including a prominent white truck, travel along the road, with some vehicles highlighted by green markings. The scene is devoid of any architectural structures, emphasizing the isolation of the desert environment. The drone's perspective provides a clear, top-down view, showcasing the linearity of the road and the orderly movement of traffic amidst the vast, arid surroundings.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, captured from directly above, shows a straight road running horizontally across the center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. A white truck is positioned in the center of the frame on the road. It is flanked by five green vehicles, initially glowing, with two to its left (center-left, middle ground) and three to its right (center-right, middle ground). Two black vehicles are also visible on the road, one further to the left (left, middle ground) and one further to the right (right, middle ground). The desert landscape occupies the top and bottom portions of the frame, acting as the background. The initial green glow around the five vehicles fades shortly after the clip begins. The vehicles remain relatively static in their positions within the frame throughout the clip.",
