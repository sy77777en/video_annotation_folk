    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, capturing the mood of the street with its architecture, parked cars, and misty ambiance. There is no main subject because the emphasis is on the overall setting and the feeling it conveys, rather than a specific object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a quiet, misty street in an urban setting, likely in the early morning. The scene is outdoors, featuring a narrow street with parked cars on one side. The buildings are characterized by wrought-iron balconies and pastel-colored facades, typical of historic architecture. The street is wet, suggesting recent rain, and the overcast sky adds to the subdued atmosphere. Trees with sparse foliage are visible along the sidewalk, and the street is empty of people, enhancing the tranquil and deserted feel. The overall color palette is muted, with soft grays and greens dominating the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a misty urban street, capturing the full breadth of the scene. The street occupies the center of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background, creating a deep perspective. On the left side, parked cars line the street, positioned in the middle ground, while trees with sparse foliage stand closer to the foreground. The buildings with wrought-iron balconies and pastel facades are situated on both sides of the street, with those on the left appearing more prominently due to their proximity to the camera. These buildings extend into the background, gradually fading into the mist. The right side features similar architectural elements, with the buildings receding further into the distance. The camera remains at a level height relative to the street, providing a direct view of the scene. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position throughout the video, maintaining a consistent and steady perspective. The wet street and overcast sky contribute to the subdued atmosphere, emphasizing the tranquil and deserted feel of the setting.",
