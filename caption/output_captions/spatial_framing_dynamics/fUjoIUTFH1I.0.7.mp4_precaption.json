    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, capturing the mood of the street with its architecture, parked cars, and misty ambiance. There is no main subject because the emphasis is on the overall setting and the feeling it conveys, rather than a specific object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a quiet, misty street in an urban setting, likely in the early morning. The scene is outdoors, featuring a narrow street with parked cars on one side. The buildings are characterized by wrought-iron balconies and pastel-colored facades, typical of historic architecture. The street is wet, suggesting recent rain, and the overcast sky adds to the subdued atmosphere. Trees with sparse foliage are visible along the sidewalk, and the street is empty of people, enhancing the tranquil and deserted feel. The overall color palette is muted, with soft grays and greens dominating the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of a city street, with the environment serving as the main focus. The street is positioned in the center of the frame, extending from the immediate foreground and receding into the foggy background, creating a strong sense of depth. On the left side of the frame, a line of parked cars occupies the foreground and middle ground, situated next to a row of buildings. On the right, another row of buildings with prominent black support posts for their balconies extends from the foreground into the middle ground. The camera is positioned at an eye-level height, capturing a straight-on view down the length of the empty street.",
