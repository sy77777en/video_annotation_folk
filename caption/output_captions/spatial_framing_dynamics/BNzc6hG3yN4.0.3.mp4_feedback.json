    "pre_caption": "This wide, top-down shot frames a man lying on his back in the center of the middle ground on a paved surface. Positioned at the top of the frame is a bicycle, while another bicycle lies on the ground at the bottom of the frame. The camera slowly pulls back, causing the elements at the top and bottom to shift toward the edges of the frame as the overall view expands to reveal more of the surrounding pavement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a high, top-down perspective, a Black man with short hair lies on his back on a paved surface. He is wearing a black jacket over a blue and white patterned shirt, dark pants, and white sneakers with green accents. To his left, another Black man is seated on a black-and-red bicycle, with a black tire next to him. To the first man's right, a blue-and-white bicycle is positioned upside down on the ground, accompanied by an orange-and-white traffic barrier. Near his feet, a BMX-style bike with a white frame and blue accents on the rims and handlebars also lies on its side on the pavement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with an eye-level view, showing a Black man lying on his back on a paved concrete surface. To his left, a black-and-red bicycle is occupied by another Black man, with a black tire nearby. To his right, a blue-and-white bicycle is positioned upside down on the ground, next to an orange-and-white traffic barrier. The scene is captured during the day under even lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
