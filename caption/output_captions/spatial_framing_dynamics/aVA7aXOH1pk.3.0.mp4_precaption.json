    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Several men are seen disembarking from a dark-colored airplane at night. The plane has a large, waving American flag painted on its tail. A light-skinned man with light-colored hair, wearing a dark blue suit, a white collared shirt, and a blue tie, walks down the lit stairs. Preceding him is another light-skinned man in a dark suit and tie. A third man in a suit is visible behind the man with light-colored hair, and another person is partially visible at the top of the stairs near the plane's entrance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night on an airport tarmac, several men in suits descend a set of illuminated mobile stairs from a large, dark-colored airplane. A prominent, waving American flag is painted on the aircraft's tail. The scene is lit by the lights on the stairs and from within the plane's open doorway. An overlay text in the bottom-left corner reads \"[1,6];x.com / @margonmarin.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "A wide shot, filmed from a low angle, captures several men disembarking from an airplane at night. The aircraft's tail, featuring a large American flag, is positioned in the top-center of the frame in the middle ground. A set of illuminated mobile stairs extends diagonally from the top right towards the bottom left, occupying the foreground and middle ground. The men, initially at the top of the stairs in the middle ground, walk down towards the camera, moving into the foreground as they descend. The primary subject, a man with light-colored hair, is centrally framed on the stairs, following another man. The camera remains stationary throughout the shot.",
