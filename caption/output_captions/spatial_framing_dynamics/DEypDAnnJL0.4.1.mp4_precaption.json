    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a wall where a framed picture is prominently in focus. This picture, set in a light-brown, possibly wooden, rectangular frame, contains a black and white artwork showing a single figure whose head is replaced by plant elements, aligning with the artwork's floral theme. A single red flower is highlighted within the composition. In the heavily blurred foreground, the dark silhouette of a person is visible from behind, holding a phone to their ear, seemingly directed towards the artwork. Also in focus on the wall, to the left of the main picture, is a partially visible, smaller, darker, rectangular framed item that seems to be a document of some kind, although it is difficult to discern due to the darkness. The camera is moving towards its left, so the second framed item only becomes visible around the four-second mark of the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space, likely a room, with a plain, light-colored wall. On this wall, a framed picture is visible. The picture depicts a single black-and-white figure with a leaf for a head and a red flower held behind their back. The frame itself is simple and light brown. Entering from the left of the frame is another smaller, darker, and less distinct framed item. The back of a person's head is out of focus, and they hold a phone to their ear. The camera moves slightly to the left, causing this figure's position in the frame to shift to the right, revealing more of the wall and a second framed item. **\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a close-up shot. Initially, a framed picture with a floral artwork is in focus, positioned in the right-center of the frame in the background. In the heavily blurred foreground, the dark silhouette of a person holding a phone to their ear is visible on the left. As the camera moves to its left, the foreground person and the main framed picture shift towards the right side of the frame. This movement reveals a second, smaller, darker framed item, possibly a document, which enters from the left and becomes partially visible in the background, to the left of the main picture. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
