    "pre_caption": "A wide shot frames a man in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. He walks away from the camera across a wet, sandy beach that occupies the foreground and bottom of the frame. In the background, large rock formations are visible on the left, while a green, tree-covered hillside extends from the center to the right, with all background elements partially obscured by fog. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man is seen from behind, walking away from the camera on a wet, sandy beach. He is wearing blue jeans, a dark long-sleeved shirt, and a dark blue puffy vest. In his right hand, he carries a camera mounted on a tripod. He has short, dark hair and appears to be of average build.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A man walks along a wide, wet sand beach under a thick blanket of fog. In the background, large, moss-covered sea stacks and a green, tree-covered hillside are partially obscured by the mist. The flat, gray sand is marked with footprints and reflects the muted light. The man, seen from behind, wears blue jeans and a dark vest and carries camera equipment as he moves away from the viewer across the expansive shoreline.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
