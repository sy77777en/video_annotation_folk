    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A single, small, green olive drops onto a wet, dark stone-paved floor. The olive is round and has a shiny surface, reflecting the ambient light. To the left, on the same floor, sits a small, white rectangular block to the right of a larger, black object. This black object has a complex shape with some white sections and exposed wires visible at its top. In the latter part of the video, a hand from an atypical 2D character comes into view and tries to pick up the olive.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a dark, wet floor composed of large, uneven flagstones. A single, green olive drops onto the lower-center of the frame on the wet surface. In the middleground, a rough, dark grey concrete step runs horizontally across the shot. To the left, on the floor, sits a black object with exposed wires, next to which is a small, white rectangular block. The area behind the step, in the background, is dimly lit and contains indistinct brown shapes, resembling a box and a shelf.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot is framed at a low, level angle, focusing on a wet, dark stone floor that occupies the foreground. A single green olive rests in the lower-center of the frame on this foreground surface. To the bottom left, also in the foreground, a black object with exposed wires is positioned next to a small white block. A dark concrete step runs horizontally across the middle ground, separating the floor from the dimly lit background, which contains indistinct brown shapes.",
