    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a series of nested Russian dolls, known as matryoshka dolls, arranged in a line. The dolls are positioned centrally within the frame, extending from the foreground to the background. The largest doll is in the background, while the smallest is in the foreground. The camera is at the same height as the dolls, providing a direct view of their painted designs. Initially, all dolls are visible, but the smallest doll is flicked out of the frame by a hand entering from the top right, altering the composition to focus on the remaining dolls. The setting is minimalist, with a plain, light-colored background that remains consistent throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a series of nested Russian dolls, known as matryoshka dolls, arranged in a line. Each doll is painted with a blue and white design, featuring a woman with a headscarf and traditional attire. The dolls decrease in size from back to front, with the largest at the back and the smallest at the front. The hand flicks the smallest matryoshka doll out of the frame. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases a series of Russian nesting dolls on a smooth, light-colored surface against a predominantly white background. The scene captures a hand interacting with the dolls. The lighting is even, enhancing the overall simplicity of the setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
