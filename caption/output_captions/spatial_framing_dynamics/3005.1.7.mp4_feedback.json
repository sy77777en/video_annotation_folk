    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a young man positioned slightly to the right of the center in the foreground, with his face occupying a significant portion of the frame. He is looking slightly up and to his right. Behind him, another young man is partially visible, positioned slightly to the left and in the middle ground, looking forward. Further in the background, to the far left, a third young man is seen in profile. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level throughout the scene, maintaining a consistent focus on the prominent man in the foreground. The background features a dark navy blue wall with stylized graphics, which remain blurred due to the shallow depth of field, emphasizing the foreground subject. The spatial composition remains stable, with no significant changes in the positioning or framing of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man of East Asian descent with short, dark hair is shown in a close-up, looking slightly up and to his right. He is wearing a light-colored jacket with a dark collar and dark detailing on the shoulders. Behind him and to his left, another young man, also of East Asian descent with short, dark hair and wearing a similar jacket, is partially visible and looking forward. Further in the background and to the far left, a third young man with short, dark hair and a darker complexion is seen in profile, also wearing a similar dark top. Due to the shallow depth of field, the faces of the other individuals appear in soft focus and are only briefly visible due to their positions and the camera framing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Indoors, a group of young men walk in a loose formation, one behind the other. The man in the foreground stands out in a light-colored jacket with a dark collar and dark detailing on the shoulders, while the others wear similar attire. They move past a dark, navy blue wall adorned with large, stylized graphics of athletes in motion, including a silhouette holding a jump rope, outlined in red and white. The scene is lit to highlight the man in the foreground, with the background elements appearing blurred due to the shallow depth of field.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
