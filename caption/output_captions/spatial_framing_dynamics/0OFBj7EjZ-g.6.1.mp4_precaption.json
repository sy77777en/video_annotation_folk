    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a dark, full-body suit is submerged in a large tank of blue water. The figure is positioned horizontally, face down, appearing to float or swim in the middle of the tank. Due to the distance and the water's slight murkiness, specific details about the person are obscured, but their form is clearly visible against the blue background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a large, cylindrical tank filled with hazy blue water. A person wearing a dark outfit floats motionless, face down, in the upper portion of the water. To the right, a portion of a rock formation is visible through the murky water. Above the water's surface, the surrounding room is dark, illuminated only by a single, bright, circular light on the ceiling, which is reflected on the top of the tank.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot filmed at the subject's level, a person floats horizontally in the center-left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground within a large tank of water. The water's surface forms a distinct horizontal line across the upper portion of the frame. Above the water, a circular ceiling light is visible at the top of the frame in the background. A rock formation occupies the bottom right of the frame, also in the middle ground. The camera and the subject remain completely still throughout the scene.",
