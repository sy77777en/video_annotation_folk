    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a padel match, capturing all four players and the full court. The camera remains stationary at the subjects' level throughout the sequence. Initially, two players are positioned on the left side of the net, with one in a black outfit and the other in a dark blue outfit with a cap. They occupy the foreground and middle ground on the left side of the frame. On the right side of the net, the opposing team consists of a player in a red shirt and another in a white and gray patterned shirt. The player in the red shirt stands near the net in the middle ground, while his partner, initially mid-jump, is also in the middle ground. \n\nAs the video progresses, the players move dynamically across the court. The player in the dark blue outfit lunges forward towards the net, hitting the ball, while his teammate in black repositions himself closer to the center. On the opposite side, the player in the red shirt moves slightly back, and his partner continues to engage actively, shifting positions to return the ball. The background consistently shows the empty tiered seating and the transparent walls enclosing the court. The spatial dynamics highlight the players' movements and interactions within the confined space of the padel court.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a padel match with four men on a court. On one side, a man in a black outfit with white accents is actively engaged in the game, holding a racket, and positioned next to him is his teammate, a man in a dark blue outfit with a cap. On the opposite side of the net, the opposing team consists of a man in a red shirt and black shorts, standing near the net and appearing focused, alongside his partner, a man in a white and gray patterned shirt and shorts, captured mid-jump, swinging his racket. The setting is an indoor sports facility with a green playing surface and transparent walls surrounding the court.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor sports setting, specifically a padel court, with a green playing surface enclosed by glass walls. The environment is well-lit, suggesting an indoor arena with artificial lighting. The background features tiered seating, which is currently unoccupied, indicating a venue designed for spectators. The court is marked with white lines, and the net divides the playing area. The players, dressed in athletic gear, are actively engaged in the game, with their movements suggesting dynamic play. The overall atmosphere is energetic, with the focus on the sporting action within the enclosed court.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
