    "pre_caption": "Initially, the video presents a wide shot of a skate park. The primary subject, a skater, is positioned in the middle ground, moving from the center-right towards the bottom center of the frame. Animated smoke effects appear in the foreground and middle ground at the bottom right, following the skater. An animated creature is visible in the middle ground on the left. In the background, a city skyline occupies the left, while palm trees are positioned in the top center and right. The camera is initially positioned above the skater. The shot then transitions, tilting upwards and moving closer to a billboard, which becomes the main subject in a full shot. The billboard, displaying \"The WORLD is your Canvas,\" dominates the upper center of the frame in the middle ground. Animated elements, including an iguana on the bottom left of the billboard structure and a UFO in the top right, are positioned around it in the middle ground. The city skyline is now visible in the background at the bottom of the frame, with palm trees in the background on the right. In this final framing, the camera is positioned below the billboard.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a vibrant skate park scene transitioning to a colorful billboard. Initially, a man in a purple jacket with a yellow and black striped pattern on its back is seen skating in a bowl. He is positioned to the left, actively maneuvering on his skateboard. Surrounding him are animated elements, including colorful shapes and smoke effects in bright yellow and pink, enhancing the dynamic atmosphere. The scene then shifts to a large billboard displaying the phrase \"The WORLD is your Canvas\" in bold, multicolored lettering. The billboard is mounted on a structure, with additional animated characters and designs surrounding it, including playful creatures and abstract shapes. The transition from the skate park to the billboard highlights a shift from an active, energetic environment to a more artistic and expressive visual display.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor urban setting at dusk, featuring a skatepark with smooth concrete surfaces and palm trees silhouetted against a colorful sky. In the background, a city skyline with illuminated buildings is visible, adding a vibrant urban contrast. The scene includes animated, colorful graffiti elements that appear to interact with the environment, such as bright, abstract shapes and figures. A prominent billboard displays the phrase \"The World is Your Canvas\" in vivid, multicolored lettering, enhancing the artistic and dynamic atmosphere. The overall scene combines natural and urban elements with creative, animated visuals, creating a lively and imaginative environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned above the subject when the first subject is in focus, and below the subject when the second subject is in focus.",
