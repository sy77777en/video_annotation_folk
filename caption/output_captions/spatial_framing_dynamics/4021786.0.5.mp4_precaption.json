    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a small, blue and white kite flying in the pale sky. The camera then tilts downward and pans to the left, focusing on a young girl seen from the back. She has dark, shoulder-length hair and is wearing a white and black horizontally striped sleeveless dress and purple and green sandals. The girl is holding a blue plastic spool with a white string attached, which is connected to an object in the sky that is not visible within the frame. She is first observed walking away from the camera, then she stops and raises her arms above her head, as if controlling the kite.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place on a paved road in a residential area under an overcast sky. Both sides of the road have grassy, unkempt patches of land with trees. On the left side, a group of people stands near or sits on several parked motorbikes. In the background, modern houses and taller apartment buildings are visible, with a construction crane briefly appearing before moving out of the frame to the right. A blue and white kite, shaped like an airplane, flies high in the pale sky. In the foreground, a young child wearing a black-and-white striped dress stands on the road.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot initially focuses on the kite in the sky, presented as a scenery shot. Then, the camera tilts down and pans to the right, shifting to the child flying the kite. The child is shown with dynamic size and finally ends with a full shot of the child.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a scenery shot, showing a small kite in the upper center of the frame, positioned in the background sky. The camera then tilts down and pans to the left, revealing a road. A large tree is on the right side of the frame in the foreground, with houses visible in the middle ground. As the camera pans, a group of people and motorbikes appear in the left middle ground. The back of a child's head enters the frame from the bottom left foreground. The camera follows as the child walks away, moving toward the center of the frame. The shot settles into a full shot of the child, who stops in the foreground, centered in the frame, with the road stretching into the middle ground behind her. The group of people remains in the left middle ground, while houses and buildings are visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the child's height.",
