    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a tranquil landscape scenery shot of a winter evening. The video presents a wide, snow-covered field under a deep blue twilight sky, where a single, brilliant celestial body, possibly a planet or the moon, shines brightly. Along the distant horizon, a thin band of orange and yellow light from the set sun backlights a dense silhouette of coniferous trees. A snow-covered path with visible tracks cuts through the foreground and stretches into the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a serene outdoor setting at twilight, a vast, snow-covered landscape unfolds under a gradient sky that shifts from deep blue at its zenith to a warm orange glow along the horizon. A single, bright celestial body is visible in the upper sky. A dark silhouette of a coniferous forest stretches across the horizon. In the foreground, a path with tracks cuts through the deep, white snow, leading toward the distant trees.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a winter landscape at twilight. The bottom half of the frame is occupied by a snow-covered field in the foreground and middle ground, with a path starting at the bottom center and receding toward the horizon. A dark silhouette of a coniferous forest stretches across the background, positioned along the lower third of the frame. The upper two-thirds of the frame consist of the sky, which displays a color gradient from a band of orange light at the horizon to deep blue at the top. A single, bright celestial body is located in the top left of the frame. In this time-lapse shot, the sky gradually darkens, revealing more stars that, along with the celestial body, drift slowly across the upper portion of the frame. The camera remains static at a low height relative to the snowy ground.",
