    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot from behind a man in a gray t-shirt, who is positioned in the right foreground. In the middle ground, a man on a bicycle is in the center, with two other men to the left. The cyclist rides from the middle ground into the foreground, stopping in the center-left of the frame. The perspective then shifts to a side view, showing the man in the gray t-shirt on the right and the cyclist on the left. The two men shake hands and then hug in the center of the frame. After they separate, the cyclist remains on the left and the other man on the right, with the two other men still visible in the left middle ground. The camera stays at the subjects' level throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man on a bicycle, wearing a black long-sleeved shirt, bright orange pants, and a blue, white, and red helmet with \"Red Bull\" branding, rides up to another man. The second man, who is standing, wears a dark gray t-shirt with a colorful \"LEATT\" logo, dark shorts, and a dark baseball cap. The two men, both smiling, shake hands and then embrace in a hug. In the middle ground, two other men are visible; one wears an orange safety vest over a t-shirt and white shorts while holding a device, and the other is partially seen also wearing an orange safety vest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, captures an outdoor scene on a sunny day. The setting is an unpaved path running alongside a set of train tracks, flanked by dense green trees and overgrown vegetation. In the mid-ground, several people are present, including one on a bicycle who approaches the foreground to exchange a handshake and a hug with another person. White text overlays with a slight black outline appear at the bottom of the screen, displaying captions such as \"F***ing awesome!\" and \"I hit the last step.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
