    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle wide shot, showing a circular stage in the center of the frame, with a large audience seated in the background. In the middle ground, a contestant stands on the left side of the stage's central platform, while the host stands on the right. The camera then moves closer, reframing to a full shot that centers on the two men. The contestant on the left sits down in his chair, opposite the host who is already seated on the right. Finally, the camera pulls back to the original high-angle wide shot, showing both men seated at the central console on the stage, with the audience visible in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a television studio, two men are featured on a circular, illuminated stage. The first man, who is light-skinned with short brown hair, walks onto the stage wearing a light blue polo shirt with a red panel on the right shoulder and dark trousers. He sits down in a high chair. Already on the stage is an older, light-skinned man with gray hair, dressed in a black suit jacket over a white collared shirt and dark trousers. He also takes a seat in a high chair, positioned opposite the first man. They are both situated at a central console which holds two computer monitors. In the background, a large audience is seated in tiered rows, watching the two men.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a television game show studio, centered around a circular stage. The main platform has a dark, solid floor and is encircled by two concentric circles of blue light, with a wider, translucent floor featuring intricate patterns illuminated from below with purple light. On the central platform, two high-backed chairs and two computer monitors on chrome stands are positioned opposite each other. In the background, a live audience is visible, seated in tiered rows. Flanking the stage are two large, curved staircases with illuminated steps. An overlay in the top-left corner displays the text \"ITV - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (2001)\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is filmed in a television studio with a full audience surrounding the seating area. In the center, there is a circular stage with two men. The camera moves closer to the men, changing the shot from wide to full, and then moves back to a wide shot again.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
