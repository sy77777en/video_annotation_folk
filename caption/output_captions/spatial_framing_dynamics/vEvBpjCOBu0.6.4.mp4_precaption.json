    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a scientific setup in a laboratory setting. Central to the scene is a transparent container placed on a perforated surface, containing a glass cup. The container is the primary focus, with its details becoming clearer as the camera moves closer. On the left, a hand, wearing a white glove, holds a green electrical plug, suggesting an interaction with the setup. On the right, a small part of another humanoid figure's arm is visible, also clad in white, indicating the presence of another person. The background is dark, emphasizing the laboratory equipment and the actions of the individuals involved.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases an indoor laboratory setting with a focus on a transparent container placed on a perforated metal surface. The container, made of clear material, holds a cylindrical object at its center. The environment features a black background, creating a sterile and controlled atmosphere. Initially, a pair of gloved hands is visible on either side of the scene, with one holding a green tool with a metallic tip. As the camera zooms in on the transparent container, the gloved hands are no longer visible. The lighting is even, emphasizing the clarity and precision of the setup. Overlay elements, located in the bottom left corner, include numbers in brackets such as [24, 35] and [26], which are not part of the physical environment and do not contribute to the scene. The video maintains an objective perspective, capturing the scene with a detached, observational view.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a scientific setup, likely in a laboratory. A transparent container with a glass cup is placed on a perforated surface in the center of the frame against a dark background. A green electrical plug is held by a hand in the foreground on the left side of the frame, while a small part of another humanoid figure's arm is visible on the right. The camera then moves forward, transitioning to a medium shot that focuses on the container and its internal details.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a scientific setup in a laboratory. The central subject is a transparent container placed on a perforated surface, occupying the middle ground and center of the frame. Inside the container, a glass cup is positioned centrally. In the foreground on the left, a hand wearing a white glove holds a green electrical plug, while a small portion of another arm, also in a white glove, is visible on the right. These elements are in the foreground, slightly off-center. The background is dark, providing contrast to the setup. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward, transitioning from a medium shot to a close-up of the transparent container. This movement brings the container into greater focus, filling more of the frame and obscuring the gloved hands initially seen on the sides. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective relative to the setup.",
