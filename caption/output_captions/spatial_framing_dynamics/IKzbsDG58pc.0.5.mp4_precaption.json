    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals an older, pale-skinned woman in a shot that begins with a slight downward tilt, then pans slightly to the right, and finally tilts slightly upward to show her face. She has long, stringy, wet, blonde hair that falls along the sides of her cheeks and the back of her neck. She appears shirtless, with her bare shoulders visible. As her face comes into full view, she lifts her head, her eyes wide and mouth slightly agape. She then raises her open hands in front of her, looking down at them with a startled expression. Her skin is illuminated by a warm, orange-toned light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, indistinct setting, a woman with long, wet, blonde hair enters the scene from the bottom and moves to the center-left. She is illuminated by a warm, low light source from the front, casting a yellow-orange glow that highlights her features and wet hair. The camera eventually captures her in a medium close-up shot against an almost completely black background with no discernible details.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a close-up shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The shot opens on a dark, indistinct background before the top of a person's head enters from the bottom of the frame. The camera tilts up to reveal the face of an older woman, transitioning into a close-up shot where she is positioned in the center-left. As she lifts her head, she then raises her hands into the foreground, looking down at them. The woman remains in the foreground, illuminated by a warm light from the front, while the background stays dark and undefined. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
