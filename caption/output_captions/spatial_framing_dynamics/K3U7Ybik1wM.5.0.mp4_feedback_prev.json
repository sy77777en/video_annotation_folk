    "pre_caption": "The video commences with a high-angle, first-person view, positioning bare feet and legs in grey trousers in the bottom foreground, extending towards the center over white bedding that occupies the lower foreground. A window is centrally located in the middle ground, with a mirror and dresser to its left and a picture frame and bookshelf to its right, all in the middle ground. The camera then tilts upward, shifting from a high angle to a more level perspective on the window, and continues its upward tilt to capture the upper walls and ceiling in the middle ground, which eventually fills the top of the frame. A visual distortion is apparent throughout this sequence. Subsequently, the scene transitions to a static, full-frame shot displaying a symmetrical, glowing green line pattern, which is centered in the foreground against a dark brown, textured background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a high-angle, first-person view from someone lying in bed, their bare feet and legs, clad in grey trousers, stretching towards the foot of the bed with white bedding. The camera tilts upward to a level angle, revealing the bedroom's interior. To the left of the window with white frames and drawn curtains, a mirror and dresser are visible, while a picture frame and bookshelf are situated to the right. The camera continues to tilt upward, capturing the pale yellow walls and brown ceiling, before transitioning to a static, abstract image. This image features a complex, symmetrical pattern of thin, glowing green lines against a dark brown, subtly textured background, resembling a kaleidoscope or a stylized web radiating from the center. The entire video evokes a sensation of dizziness.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video opens with a dizzying first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, looking down at bare feet and legs in dark grey pants on a bed with light-colored bedding. The frame features a slight distortion to enhance the sense of disorientation. The view is directed towards a three-panel, white-framed window that offers a glimpse of daytime greenery and a car outside, framed by light-colored patterned curtains. The bedroom setting includes a mirror over a dresser to the left and a bookshelf to the right, with light-colored walls. The camera then tilts upwards, moving past the window to the light-colored ceiling, before the scene transitions to an abstract, symmetrical green line-art pattern, resembling a kaleidoscope or stylized flower, against a dark brown, subtly textured background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
