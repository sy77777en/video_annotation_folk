    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of people runs through a wooded area from a low-angle perspective. In the midground, the most prominent figure wears light-colored pants and white sneakers. Just behind them, another person is visible in green pants. In the foreground, a person wears blue jeans, and further back, a woman with a darker skin tone is seen running in a brown crop top and blue jeans.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle, ground-level perspective, a group of people runs through a sunlit forest. The ground is covered in a thick layer of brown pine needles and dirt. In the background, tall, slender trees with green leaves are visible against a bright sky. The individuals are wearing casual attire, including blue jeans, green pants, and beige pants, along with light-colored sneakers. The rapid movement creates significant motion blur in the foreground, while the dappled sunlight filters through the trees, illuminating the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a low-angle medium shot, the lower bodies of several people run through a forest. The ground, covered in pine needles, is a heavily blurred element in the immediate foreground, occupying the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, the legs of a person in light-colored pants are in the center, with another person in green pants to the left and a third in blue jeans just right of center. A woman is visible in the background at the top right, running among tall trees that extend across the top of the frame. The camera, positioned very low to the ground, captures the dynamic forward motion of the group, creating significant motion blur throughout the scene.",
