    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two illuminated architectural models are presented on a black cutting mat with a white grid. The model on the left is a low, curved structure made of a translucent, light-blue material, lit from within. The word \"Vdara\" is visible on its upper left curve. It sits on a black base that has a white cutout in front, detailed with smaller shapes representing a layout. To the right stands a taller model of a skyscraper, also crafted from a translucent, ribbed material and internally illuminated with a similar blue light. This building has a rectangular footprint with curved sides. In front of its base, several small, white, illuminated objects are arranged in rows, resembling miniature streetlights or landscape features.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, two architectural models rest on a black cutting mat marked with a white grid. Both models are made of a translucent, blue-tinted material and are illuminated from within by a cool blue light. The model on the left is a curved, layered wall structure with the word \"Vdara\" inscribed on it, sitting on a base with white cutouts. To its right stands a taller, curved skyscraper model on a separate base, which also features a grid of small, illuminated white shapes. The surrounding desk area is dark, with a chair, a notebook with a pair of glasses resting on it, and markers visible in the blurred background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot, two illuminated architectural models are presented from a high angle. The models are situated in the middle ground, with a low, curved structure on the left and a taller skyscraper model on the right. They rest on a black cutting mat marked with a white grid, which occupies the foreground and middle ground of the frame. In the blurred background, a chair is positioned behind and between the two models, while a notebook and glasses are visible in the top left corner and markers are in the top right.",
