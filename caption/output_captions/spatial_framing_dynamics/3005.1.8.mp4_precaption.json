    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, black-and-white mural of a Black man, a basketball player, is depicted on a wall. The man in the mural has a shaved head, is wearing a basketball jersey, and has his arms outstretched to the sides. In the foreground, a man with short, dark hair is seen from the back, looking up at the mural. He wears a dark blue jacket with white Chinese characters, \"\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e8c\u4e2d\", printed on the back.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors, featuring a long corridor with a large black-and-white mural of a basketball player with outstretched arms on the wall. The setting is well-lit with a modern, minimalist design, characterized by clean lines and a smooth floor. The time of day is not specified due to the indoor environment. A person is present, walking along the corridor, facing the mural, which dominates the scene. Overlay text appears in the lower part of the scene, providing additional information or context. The overall atmosphere is calm and focused, with the mural serving as a central visual element.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a man, seen from the back, is positioned in the bottom right foreground. He is looking up at a large, black-and-white mural of a basketball player that dominates the center and left of the frame, situated on a wall in the middle ground. White Chinese characters are visible on the back of the man's jacket, and additional text is overlaid in the bottom left corner. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
