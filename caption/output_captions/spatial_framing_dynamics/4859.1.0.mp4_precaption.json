    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with shoulder-length brown hair and a beard, wearing a green t-shirt, a yellow reflective vest, tan pants, and a black cap, pushes a large green wheeled trash can. The trash can has a black graffiti-style drawing of a face on its side. A second individual, dressed in a full-body light gray bird costume with an orange beak and large wings, and wearing bright red footwear, rides a skateboard, entering the frame from the right side halfway through the video and appearing to jump or perform a trick near the trash can.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a sunlit, paved urban plaza during the day. Large, light-colored tiles cover the ground, reflecting the bright sunlight. Long shadows stretch across the plaza, created by various elements in the scene, such as the trash bin. In the background, several multi-story buildings are visible, with one prominent structure featuring a tall tower. Green trees line the edge of the plaza. A green, wheeled trash bin with black graffiti depicting a face is being pushed across the plaza.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a full shot. Initially, a man is in the left foreground, pushing a green trash can that occupies the center-right foreground; he moves towards the right across a sunlit plaza. The sun, positioned in the top left, casts long shadows from left to right across the foreground. Buildings and trees are visible in the background, predominantly on the left and extending across the horizon. As the man leans back, shifting his position to the left of center in the foreground, the trash can tilts in the center foreground. Simultaneously, a second individual in a bird costume on a skateboard enters from the middle ground right, rides into the foreground right, and performs a trick near the now-tilted trash can. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
