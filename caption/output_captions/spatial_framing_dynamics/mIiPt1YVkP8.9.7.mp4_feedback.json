    "pre_caption": "This video opens with an extreme wide shot from a high angle, showing a white airplane in the center middle ground, positioned on a runway that extends from the bottom of the frame into the background. The camera then moves forward and pans to the right, causing the shot to transition into a full shot. This movement repositions the stationary airplane from the center to the left foreground, revealing its side profile against the runway and taxiways that now occupy the right side and middle ground of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white, unmarked commercial airplane is stationary on an airport runway. The aircraft, which has two engines mounted beneath its wings and a conventional tail fin, is positioned at the start of the runway over the white threshold stripes and is aligned with the dashed centerline. The airplane remains motionless on the dark grey tarmac throughout the sequence.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an airport runway under a hazy, reddish-brown sky. A long, dark asphalt runway, marked with white painted lines and a striped threshold, extends into the foggy distance. A plain white commercial airplane is stationary on the runway near the markings. The surrounding landscape is flat and green-brown, with a network of intersecting taxiways visible. The drone's perspective moves from a view down the length of the runway to a pan alongside the stationary aircraft, revealing its side profile against the backdrop of the hazy airport environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
