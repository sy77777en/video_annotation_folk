    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a cityscape scenery shot of a quiet, rain-soaked suburban street. The scene features wet pavement reflecting the overcast sky, flanked by neatly arranged houses with light-colored facades and lush green trees lining the sidewalks. Power lines stretch across the sky, adding a sense of depth and structure. Towards the end of the central road, vehicles travel in both directions, introducing a dynamic element to the otherwise serene and tranquil environment. The focus is on the interplay of natural and urban elements, highlighting the tranquil yet subtly active atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, capturing a quiet residential street on a rainy day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a gently sloping road flanked by modest, cream-colored houses with tiled roofs. The street is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, their leaves glistening with raindrops. Overhead, a network of power lines stretches across the gray, overcast sky, adding a sense of depth to the scene. The wet pavement reflects the muted light, enhancing the tranquil atmosphere. Towards the end of the road, vehicles are visible in the background, moving in and out of view, adding a subtle dynamic element to the serene, rain-soaked environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a quiet, rain-soaked suburban street. The scene is framed with the road running from the bottom center to the top center, creating a sense of depth. Houses with light-colored facades are positioned on both the left and right sides of the frame, occupying the middle ground. Lush green trees line the sidewalks, with some branches extending into the foreground on the left and right edges. Power lines stretch horizontally across the top of the frame, adding structure and depth to the background. Vehicles are visible towards the end of the road in the background, moving in and out of view, introducing subtle motion. The camera is positioned at street level, capturing the scene from a height that aligns with the road and houses.",
