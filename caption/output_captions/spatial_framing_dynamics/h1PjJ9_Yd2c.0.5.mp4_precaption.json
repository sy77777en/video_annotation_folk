    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with light skin and reddish-brown hair styled in a ponytail sits on a wooden bench in a dimly lit hallway. She is shown in profile, looking toward the right side of the scene. She is wearing a dark, short-sleeved shirt and dark shorts, with her hands resting on her lap.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit hallway with light brown brick walls, a woman sits in partial shadow on a wooden bench. A light source from outside the door on the right side of the frame illuminates the wall beside her, highlighting a row of metal coat hooks. The hallway opens into a hazy or steamy locker room, where light filters through two high windows. Inside the room, a towel hangs from a rack over a long bench, upon which some bags are placed. A dark door with a small window is visible on the right side of the hallway.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, a woman sits on a bench in the lower-left quadrant of the frame, positioned in the middle ground of a hallway. The hallway itself is framed by a brick wall with coat hooks on the left in the middle ground and another brick wall with a door on the far right in the foreground. A central doorway provides a view into a hazy locker room in the background. The camera is positioned above the subject, looking slightly down.",
