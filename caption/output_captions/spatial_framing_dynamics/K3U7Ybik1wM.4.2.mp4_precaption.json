    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dimly lit bedroom is shown, with the main focus on a bed made with white sheets and pillows. A small, circular, wall-mounted lamp next to the bed casts a warm, orange glow across the bedding, highlighting the rumpled texture of the sheets. A red pillow is partially visible behind the white ones. At the beginning of the video, a painting is visible on the right wall before it moves out of the frame. On the beige wall above the bed, there is a long, rectangular framed picture. An open doorway to the right of the bed reveals a view into a more brightly lit hallway.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a dimly lit bedroom. The primary light source is a small, circular lamp on the wall, which casts a warm, orange glow onto an unmade bed with white sheets and pillows. A red pillow is visible next to the white ones. Above the bed, a long, rectangular framed picture hangs on the beige wall. An open doorway offers a view into a lit hallway, where a toilet and a chair can be seen in the background. Another framed picture is on the wall to the right of the doorway. The rest of the room is enveloped in shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium shot, filmed at the subject's level, initially frames a bed in the foreground, occupying the bottom half of the frame from left to right. A wall-mounted lamp is positioned in the middle ground on the left, with a framed picture above it in the top left. In the center-right, an open doorway in the middle ground reveals a hallway in the background, and another framed picture is visible on the wall in the top right. The camera then slowly pans to the left, causing the picture on the right wall to move out of the frame. Consequently, the bed, lamp, and the picture above the bed shift towards the right side of the frame, while the doorway also moves further right, slightly altering the perspective of the background hallway.",
