    "pre_caption": "The video captures a scene inside a diner from a first-person perspective, with the camera positioned above the subjects. Two women are seated at a booth with red cushioned seats and a wooden table. The woman on the left, wearing a green beret and a patterned brown top, is initially seen holding a camera and smiling. She is positioned in the middle-left of the frame, in the foreground. The woman on the right, wearing a red beret, a dark jacket, and a red scarf, is situated in the middle-right of the frame, also in the foreground. The table between them is cluttered with various items such as a drink cup, condiment bottles, and a basket with food, occupying the center of the frame. As the video progresses, the woman on the left moves her hand closer to the camera, partially obscuring the view. The background shows other diners and tables, contributing to the lively ambiance of the diner. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining a consistent overhead angle relative to the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two women seated at a diner booth with red cushioned seats and a wooden table. The woman on the left has light skin, wears a green beret, glasses, and a patterned brown top, and is holding a camera while smiling. The woman on the right has light skin, wears a red beret, a dark jacket, and a red scarf, and is looking towards the camera. The table is cluttered with items including a drink cup, condiment bottles, and a basket with food. The setting suggests a casual dining environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot inside a retro-style diner. The setting features red vinyl booth seating and wooden tables, creating a classic American diner atmosphere. The lighting is warm and slightly dim, suggesting an evening or nighttime setting. The tables are adorned with typical diner items like condiment bottles and paper napkins. The environment is lively, with patrons engaged in conversation, adding to the bustling ambiance. The scene captures the essence of a cozy, nostalgic diner experience.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
