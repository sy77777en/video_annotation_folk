    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a complex focus transition in a dining setting. Initially, the subject is a woman with medium-length dark hair, glasses, and a light brown skin tone, wearing a yellow patterned top and holding chopsticks over a plate of food. The focus then shifts to a man with glasses wearing a maroon shirt. Following this, it transitions to a woman with long dark hair and glasses, dressed in a maroon vest over a black top. Finally, the focus is on a woman with glasses, wearing a maroon vest with gold trim over a white shirt, and her name tag reads \"Susan.\" She has a light brown skin tone and is holding chopsticks in front of a plate with green vegetables. A glass of iced tea is visible on the table. The transitions between individuals occur smoothly, suggesting a deliberate shift in focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting within a dimly lit restaurant, highlighting a table set for a meal. The environment exudes a warm, subdued ambiance with dark wooden elements and traditional decor. As the camera pans from left to right, it showcases the interior details: framed paintings on the decorated walls, tables with white tablecloths, and an elegant ceiling with a delicate chandelier. The camera initially focuses on a glass of iced tea and a plate of noodles on a white-clothed table, then shifts to reveal more plates of food on the same table, including a dish with noodles and vegetables. Soft lighting casts gentle shadows, enhancing the intimate atmosphere. The scene includes individuals seated at the table, engaged in dining with chopsticks in hand, suggesting a calm, focused dining experience, with the restaurant's decor and table setting providing a cohesive backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a medium shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of the first subject, a woman with chopsticks, positioned in the center of the frame in the foreground. Her plate of food is directly in front of her, slightly lower in the frame. The camera is at her eye level. As the focus transitions, the shot remains a medium shot, now featuring a man in a maroon shirt in the center of the frame, also in the foreground. The camera maintains its position at his eye level. Next, the focus shifts to a woman in a maroon vest, who is centered in the frame, again in the foreground, with the camera still at her eye level. Finally, the focus moves to another woman in a maroon vest with gold trim, also centered in the foreground, with the camera remaining at her eye level. Throughout these transitions, the background consistently shows the dimly lit restaurant interior, with tables and decor elements like framed paintings and a chandelier visible in the middle and background. The glass of iced tea and other plates of food remain on the table in the foreground, slightly shifting positions as the focus changes. There are no significant changes in the camera's height relative to the subjects; it stays consistent throughout the sequence.",
