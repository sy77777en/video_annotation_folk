    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, child-like figure wearing a bright yellow raincoat with a pointed hood that obscures its face is seen in a dimly lit room. In the background, several grotesquely obese, human-like figures with pale, waxy skin and distorted facial features are gathered around a long dining table. One of these large figures, a woman with her hair in a bun, is hunched over the table, appearing to eat from a large, cooked fish head. Another massive, bald-headed figure with a sagging face crawls on the floor in the foreground. The table is laden with an excessive amount of food, including long links of sausages and various meats.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, a small figure in a yellow hooded coat runs across a wide, wooden plank floor. The scene is set in a large, dimly lit room with a dark, hazy atmosphere. In the background, several disproportionately large, grotesque figures are seated at a long wooden table laden with various meats, including a large fish head and sausages. Another large figure lies on the floor in the foreground. The room features Japanese-style grid windows, through which more large figures can be seen in an adjacent, steamy area. A single light source from above casts a spotlight on the floor as the small character moves from the center towards the right side of the room.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot captured from a high angle, a small figure in a yellow coat is initially positioned in the center middle ground on a wooden floor. In the background, several large, grotesque figures are seated around a long dining table. As the small figure runs from the center toward the right side of the frame, a massive, bald-headed figure crawls into the scene from the bottom left, occupying the left foreground. The camera pans slightly to the right, following the small figure's movement across the middle ground.",
