    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot of a traditional Japanese building. The shot begins with a large, roofed wooden signboard in the center middle ground, displaying a photograph. A portion of the building is visible behind it in the middle and background, with a large rock in the bottom left foreground. The camera then pans to the left, shifting the signboard to the right side of the frame. This movement reveals a wooden entrance gate with a white banner in the center-left middle ground, fronted by a low wooden fence. A small gravel garden with rocks occupies the foreground from the bottom left to the center, while more of the building's facade is shown in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cultural scenery shot of a traditional Japanese building. The scene begins focused on a large wooden sign displaying a photograph of a tranquil garden with a pond and mountains. The camera then pans left, revealing more of the building's exterior, which features white plaster walls, dark wooden framing, and a tiled roof. This movement brings into view a small, meticulously arranged gravel garden with moss-covered rocks, a low wooden fence, and a large wooden gate. A white banner with black circular crests hangs above the gate, adding to the traditional aesthetic. The shot lacks a single main subject, as the focus is on capturing the serene atmosphere and architectural details of the temple-like environment, from the sign and garden to the latticed windows and entryway.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, pans left across the exterior of a traditional Japanese building during the day. The view initially centers on a large, roofed wooden signboard that holds a color photograph of a garden with a pond, a building, and mountains under a blue sky. As the camera moves, it reveals the building's facade, characterized by dark wood paneling, white plaster walls, and a window with vertical wooden slats. In the foreground, a small area contains white gravel, moss, and several large rocks. The video concludes by showing a wooden entrance gate, from which a white banner with black calligraphy and circular emblems is suspended. A low wooden fence is visible near the entrance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
