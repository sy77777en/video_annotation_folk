    "pre_caption": "A medium full shot centers on a person in a yeti costume in the foreground. Behind them, a vast, snow-covered mountain slope occupies the middle ground and background, with rocky peaks visible in the background on the left and right. A clear blue sky fills the top of the frame, with the sun positioned in the top right. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing a low-angle point-of-view as they snowboard. As the person carves down the mountain, the camera, held by the subject, moves with them, maintaining their central position while the background scenery shifts and the frame tilts with their turns.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person is shown wearing a full-body, white, fluffy costume resembling a yeti or an abominable snowman. The costume's head features a mask with a wide-open, snarling mouth displaying large, sharp teeth. Two curved, yellowish horns protrude from the sides of the head. The person wears large, yellow-lensed ski goggles over the mask's eye area. A black harness is strapped over the chest of the white suit, and the person is wearing white gloves. They are positioned on a snowboard, leaning into a turn with one arm extended to the side while holding a selfie stick with the other arm.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot captures a person in a white, furry monster costume with horns and ski goggles snowboarding down a steep, snow-covered mountain. The scene takes place during the daytime under a clear, deep blue sky with the bright sun visible in the upper right. The person is moving down the slope, kicking up a spray of white powder snow. In the background, the vast mountain landscape features other snow-covered peaks and rocky outcrops.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
