    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static wide shot of a Japanese street intersection. In the bottom left foreground, a tiled sidewalk with a dark metal railing extends into the scene. The middle ground is occupied by a wide road with a crosswalk, where several cars are positioned. A large concrete overpass is framed on the right, curving from the middle ground into the background. In the center background, a hill covered in green trees is visible, with the roof of a traditional building peeking through the foliage. A red traffic light hangs in the top left of the frame, while the sky fills the upper portion of the scene. The camera remains stationary at an eye-level height throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a tranquil urban scene at a Japanese street corner, where a clean, tiled sidewalk on the left is paved with orderly stone slabs and marked by a yellow guiding line. A black wrought-iron fence runs alongside, providing separation and protection. Various posts, including vintage-style lampposts, traffic light poles, and signage posts, line the street. The view extends across a wide, multi-lane road, clearly marked with crosswalks and dotted with traffic cones, towards a hillside covered in lush, green trees, with the roof of a traditional building peeking through the foliage. A large, modern concrete overpass curves across the right side of the frame, contrasting with the natural landscape. The static camera captures a wide perspective, giving equal weight to the road, the bridge, the trees, and the bright blue sky with fluffy clouds, focusing on the peaceful atmosphere and the harmonious blend of nature and infrastructure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a street intersection in a Japanese city on a bright, sunny day. The sky is a vivid blue with scattered white clouds. To the right, a large concrete overpass curves across the scene. In the center, beyond the asphalt road marked with a white crosswalk, a small hill is covered in lush green trees, with a traditional Japanese-style building and a stone lantern visible at its base. The sidewalk in the foreground is paved with grey and yellow tactile tiles and is bordered by a dark metal railing. A red traffic light hangs overhead, and several cars, including a white minivan and a black sedan, are stopped or moving slowly through the intersection, which is lined with orange traffic cones.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
