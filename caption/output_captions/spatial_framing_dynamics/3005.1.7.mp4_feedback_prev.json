    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a young man positioned slightly to the right of the center in the foreground, with his face occupying a significant portion of the frame. He is looking slightly up and to his right. Behind him, another young man is partially visible, positioned slightly to the left and in the middle ground, looking forward. Further in the background, to the far left, a third young man is seen in profile. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level throughout the scene, maintaining a consistent focus on the prominent man in the foreground. The background features a dark navy blue wall with stylized graphics, which remain blurred due to the shallow depth of field, emphasizing the foreground subject. The spatial composition remains stable, with no significant changes in the positioning or framing of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man of East Asian descent with short, dark hair is shown in a close-up, looking slightly up and to his right. He is wearing a dark collared jacket with white accents on the shoulders. Behind him and to his left, another young man, also of East Asian descent with short, dark hair and wearing a similar jacket, is partially visible and looking forward. Further in the background and to the far left, a third young man with short, dark hair and a darker complexion is seen in profile, also wearing a similar dark top.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Indoors, a group of young men in dark athletic attire with white accents on the shoulders walk in a single file. They move past a dark, navy blue wall decorated with large, stylized graphics of athletes in motion. The figures on the wall, rendered as silhouettes with red and white outlines, include one holding a jump rope. The scene is lit to highlight the prominent man in the foreground, while all other elements in the background appear blurred due to the shallow depth of field.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
