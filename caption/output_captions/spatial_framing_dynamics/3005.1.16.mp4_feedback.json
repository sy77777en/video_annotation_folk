    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a young man, capturing him from the shoulders up. He is positioned slightly off-center to the left in the frame, occupying the foreground. The background consists of an indoor setting with neutral-colored walls and minimal decor, situated in the middle ground. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout the sequence. Initially, the man has his eyes closed, and as the frames progress, he opens his eyes and looks directly towards the camera. There is no significant change in the shot size or the subject's position within the frame. The lighting is soft, enhancing the subject's facial features without altering the spatial dynamics. The text \"\u800c\u662f\u8fd9\u4e00\u523b\" appears briefly at the bottom of the frame, maintaining the focus on the subject's contemplative state. The camera angle and height remain constant, ensuring a steady and direct view of the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young man with short dark hair and a light skin tone. He is wearing a dark blue shirt and is captured in a close-up view, focusing on his face. His expression is neutral, with his eyes closed initially and then open, suggesting a moment of contemplation or thoughtfulness. The lighting is soft, highlighting his facial features and creating a calm atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with subdued lighting, suggesting a calm, introspective atmosphere. The environment appears to be a room with neutral-colored walls and minimal decor, focusing on a person who is positioned slightly off-center to the left within the frame. The lighting is soft, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the person's contemplative expression. The time of day is indeterminate due to the controlled indoor lighting. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, providing a detached, observational perspective. Overlay elements include text or visuals that are not part of the scene, positioned unobtrusively within the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
