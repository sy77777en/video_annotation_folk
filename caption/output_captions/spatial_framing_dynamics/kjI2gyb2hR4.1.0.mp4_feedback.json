    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot captures a person's foot and sneaker positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, suspended in mid-air. The lower part of their black pants occupies the top center of the frame. Below the foot, a multi-colored court with grey, blue, and red sections is visible in the foreground and middle ground, filling the bottom half of the frame. A blurred beige wall is situated in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the frame is slightly tilted. Throughout the clip, the foot remains relatively static in its central position, with only a very slight forward movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up shot focuses on a person's foot and lower leg suspended in mid-air. The person wears wide-leg black pants and a low-top Nike Air Jordan 1 sneaker. The shoe features a red toe box, white side panels, and a black Nike swoosh. The heel counter is made of a black, textured material, and a small gold accent is visible on the heel tab. The shoe has an off-white midsole and a red outsole.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting, a person's foot is captured in motion, moving forward above a multi-colored court. The person wears black pants and a low-top sneaker with a red toe, a white mid-panel, a black swoosh, and a textured black heel. The shoe features an off-white midsole and a red outsole. The court below is painted in sections of grey, blue, and red, with white lines separating the colors. A beige wall is visible in the blurred background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
