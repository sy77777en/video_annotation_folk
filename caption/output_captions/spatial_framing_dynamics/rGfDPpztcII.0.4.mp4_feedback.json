    "pre_caption": "A person is captured in a medium shot, positioned in the center foreground of the frame and visible from the chest up. Behind them, a snow-covered slope occupies the middle ground, with evergreen trees flanking the scene on the left and right. The camera, held at the subject's level, maintains a fixed perspective on the person as they move forward. Consequently, the subject remains stationary in the center of the frame while the background scenery of snow and trees rushes past, indicating a descent down the slope.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, likely a man, is shown in a medium close-up shot from a camera mounted on his helmet. He is wearing a light-colored, camouflage-patterned snow jacket and black gloves. On his head, he wears a light green helmet with stickers and large ski goggles with a reflective orange lens and a black frame. His beard and mustache are completely covered in thick white frost, and his mouth is open. A light blue nose guard is visible on the bridge of his nose, just below the goggles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, seemingly mounted to a person, captures a descent down a snow-covered mountain slope during the daytime. The environment is an outdoor winter landscape under an overcast sky, characterized by deep white snow covering the ground and dusting the surrounding evergreen trees. From this perspective, the upper body of a person is visible, wearing a light green helmet and large, orange-lensed goggles. Their lower face is obscured by a beard and mustache completely encrusted with white ice and snow. They are dressed in a white and grey camouflage-patterned winter jacket.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
