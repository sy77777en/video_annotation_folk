    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on an empty, paved path curving through a dense forest, and then a young man with dark hair is revealed as he runs into the frame from around the bend. He is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved hooded sweatshirt, dark shorts, and running shoes as he jogs along the path.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A paved asphalt path, marked with a yellow center line, winds through a dense forest. The path is enveloped by lush green foliage and tall, slender trees that form a thick canopy overhead. Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled light and shadows across the scene. A person is seen running along the path, emerging from behind the trees on the right side of the frame, where the path continues out of view.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a static wide shot of a paved path located in the foreground and middle ground, which curves from the bottom left towards the right side of the frame before disappearing behind foliage. The path is surrounded by dense green bushes in the middle ground and a forest of tall trees in the background. A man is then revealed entering the frame from the middle ground on the right, running along the path. As he moves towards the center and then towards the bottom left, the framing becomes a full shot, with the camera positioned at his level.",
