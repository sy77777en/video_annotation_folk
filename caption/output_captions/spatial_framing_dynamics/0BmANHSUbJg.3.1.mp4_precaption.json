    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large passenger airplane with a white fuselage and visible windows, positioned prominently in the foreground. The aircraft is partially engulfed in a fiery explosion, with bright orange flames and thick black smoke emanating from its wing. The explosion creates a dramatic contrast against the night setting, with the flames illuminating the scene. In the background, a hangar with bright lights is visible, providing a stark contrast to the dark sky. The sequence captures the intensity of the explosion and the subsequent smoke, highlighting the dramatic impact on the airplane.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a dramatic scene at an airport during nighttime, with a locked-on POV shot fixed to an aircraft. The setting is outdoors, featuring a large airplane adjacent to a hangar. The environment is illuminated by bright lights on the hangar, casting reflections on the wet tarmac. A significant explosion occurs as the airplane crashes into the hangar, causing it to collapse. Flames and thick black smoke engulf the wing of the aircraft, with the fire's intense orange and yellow hues contrasting against the dark night sky. The scene transitions from the initial explosion to the aftermath, where smoke continues to billow, partially obscuring the view of the collapsed hangar and the aircraft. The fixed perspective emphasizes the unfolding chaos and destruction.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a large passenger airplane in the foreground, with its white fuselage and windows clearly visible. The aircraft occupies the right side of the frame, while the explosion occurs near its wing, positioned slightly towards the center-left. Initially, bright orange flames and thick black smoke dominate the middle ground, emerging from the wing area. The hangar, located in the background on the left side, is brightly lit, creating a stark contrast against the dark night sky. As the video progresses, the explosion intensifies, causing the hangar to collapse. The flames and smoke increase in volume, gradually obscuring more of the hangar and the aircraft. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a fixed perspective that captures the unfolding chaos. The spatial dynamics shift as the explosion evolves, with the smoke and flames expanding from the center-left towards the center-right, eventually dominating the middle ground and partially obscuring the hangar and the airplane. The wet tarmac reflects the bright lights, adding depth to the scene. The camera's stationary position emphasizes the dramatic impact of the explosion and the subsequent destruction.",
