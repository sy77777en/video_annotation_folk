    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A stylized, cat-like creature, rendered entirely in yellow pixel art, is situated within an isometric, maze-like structure also made of yellow blocks on a black background. The structure features staircases and arches arranged in an impossible, Escher-esque configuration. At the bottom of the screen, a user interface is displayed, featuring a yellow stick figure icon next to the number \"04\" on the left. In the center, a purple symbol labeled 'Day' is shown, with the number '00' displayed in white on a black background below it. To the right, a red-bordered square contains a white circular object resembling a human face, with a simple yellow icon above it, drawn in a sketch-like style.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows the environment in a three-quarters perspective. The scene is a retro, pixelated video game level set against a solid black background. The environment consists of an abstract architectural structure made entirely of yellow, pixelated cubes, forming a maze-like series of stairs, platforms, and archways. A yellow, cat-like character moves behind an archway, turns right, and proceeds toward the steps. It then jumps twice, landing on the second step of the staircase, before turning left again. The bottom of the screen features a user interface overlay with yellow, scroll-like borders. On the left, an icon of a person is next to the number \"04\". In the center, the word \"DAY\" is displayed in purple pixelated text. On the right, a red ornate frame contains a white circular object with a face-like design.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, high-angle shot of a video game scene, captured from an isometric perspective. An abstract, yellow, maze-like structure is located in the middle ground, occupying the upper half of the frame. A user interface is positioned in the foreground across the bottom of the screen, with icons and text at the bottom left, bottom center, and bottom right. A yellow, cat-like creature is initially positioned in the middle ground on the left side of the structure. It moves from behind an archway, turns right, and proceeds toward a staircase. The creature then jumps up two steps before turning to face left.",
