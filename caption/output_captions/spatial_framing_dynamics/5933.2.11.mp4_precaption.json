    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium build and a beard, wearing a light brown jacket over a blue shirt. He has short, dark hair and carries a backpack. The man is walking through a field of tall, dry grass, with his gaze directed forward. His expression is neutral, and he appears to be moving steadily through the landscape. The setting is natural, with bare trees visible in the distance, suggesting a late autumn or early winter environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting in a field of tall, golden reeds under a cloudy sky. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, with soft, diffused sunlight casting a warm glow over the scene. Bare trees are visible in the background, suggesting a late autumn or early winter season. The reeds sway gently, indicating a light breeze. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with the earthy tones of the reeds contrasting against the muted sky. A person is present, moving through the reeds, adding a sense of scale and interaction with the environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a man walking through a field of tall, dry grass. The man occupies the center of the frame, with his upper body and part of his legs visible. He moves steadily from the background towards the foreground, maintaining a central position throughout the sequence. The tall grass surrounds him, filling the foreground and middle ground, while bare trees form the background. The camera remains at the subject's height, capturing his movement as he pushes aside the reeds with his hands. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera angle; the man consistently stays in the center, emphasizing his interaction with the environment. The spatial dynamics highlight the man's steady progression through the field, with the reeds swaying slightly around him.",
