    "pre_caption": "This wide shot presents a static scene with several floating structures in the middle ground set against a colorful, banded sky in the background. Two tall, vertical stone pillars occupy the center of the frame, one on the left and one on the right. A small, white creature is positioned at the top center on the highest point of the left pillar. Another creature is located in the center of the frame, within a recess of the same left pillar, while a third stands on a ledge to the right of center on the right pillar. In the top right corner, a separate, broken, dark platform hovers. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down on the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features several small, white, pixelated creatures with simple, blocky forms. One creature, positioned on a high platform, is distinguished by a small, raised feature on its head, resembling a hat or a tuft of hair. Another similar white creature is partially visible inside a recess in a vertical, grassy structure. A third creature, identical in its simple white form to the second, stands on a ledge on a separate vertical structure. All the creatures are rendered in a minimalist pixel art style, lacking detailed facial features or limbs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a third-person side point of view, where the camera is positioned to the side of the character. The scene is set in an outdoor, pixel-art environment against a stylized sky composed of horizontal bands of color, transitioning from light pink at the top to a deep red at the bottom. Several tall, vertical pillars made of grey, blocky stone float in the space. Patches of green grass, vines, and small red flowers adorn some of the platforms. In the upper right, a separate, darker, broken platform hovers. Small, white, bird-like characters are positioned on various ledges of the pillars.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
