    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, appearing to be in his late 50s or early 60s, with short, neatly combed gray hair, fair skin, and a furrowed brow creating a stern facial expression, is the central figure, standing and facing directly forward. He wears a dark blue military service dress uniform jacket, distinguished by a large array of colorful ribbon bars and a silver pilot wings insignia on the left breast, metallic star insignia on the shoulder straps, various emblems on the lapels, and a name tag on the right breast. A light blue shirt and a dark necktie are visible at the collar. In the dimly lit background, three other figures in formal attire are present but indistinct: one man to his left, another to his right, and a third individual positioned further behind him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit room with a serious atmosphere, likely a control or command center. The environment features dark walls and subdued lighting, creating a focused and intense setting. Several individuals in military uniforms are present, with one prominently positioned in the foreground. The uniforms are dark blue with various colorful insignias and medals, indicating rank and achievements. The background includes blurred screens emitting a soft glow, suggesting the presence of technology and monitoring equipment. The overall ambiance is formal and professional, with a sense of authority and purpose.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static medium close-up shot, a man in a military uniform is positioned in the center foreground. To his left, another man is partially visible in the middle ground. In the background, a third man stands on the right, and a fourth figure is positioned in the center, directly behind the main subject. The camera remains fixed at the main subject's eye level.",
