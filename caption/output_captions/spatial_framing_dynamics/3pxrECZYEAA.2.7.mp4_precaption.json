    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a cartoon-style scene set in a bar, viewed from an adjacent room. A man with light skin and short blonde hair is behind the bar counter, wearing a dark brown shirt. Initially resting his head on his hand, he later drinks from a cup. The bar is stocked with various bottles and cans, organized neatly on shelves. The walls are adorned with colorful posters, including a dartboard and a neon sign that reads \"Beer.\" The floor has a checkered pattern, and a potted plant is visible on the left side. The setting is vibrant, with a warm color palette dominated by reds and yellows, effectively juxtaposed with the darker, cooler colors outside. As the video progresses, the focus shifts inward, reducing the visibility of the exterior.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This animated scene is viewed from a dark, purple-toned room looking into a brightly lit, red-hued bar. The foreground contains a large potted plant on the left and a purple entertainment console with a turntable on the right. On the wall above the console hangs a framed picture of a blue, reclining figure with a television for a head. The bar in the background has a yellow and brown checkered floor, a wooden counter, and shelves stocked with various bottles and stacks of white cups. The red walls are adorned with a neon \"Beer\" sign, a dartboard, a mounted fish, and a license plate. A blond man in a brown shirt stands behind the counter, initially resting his head on his hand before sitting up and taking a drink from a cup.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is presented as a wide shot, framed from a dark foreground room looking into a brightly lit middle-ground bar. In the bottom-left foreground is a large potted plant, and on the right side of the foreground is an entertainment console with a framed picture of a reclining figure on the wall above it. The central part of the frame reveals the bar scene, where a man is positioned in the center behind a counter that extends across the middle ground. Behind him, shelves of bottles and cups are in the middle ground, with a decorated wall in the background. The camera is positioned at the man's level. Throughout the shot, the frame slowly zooms in, slightly cropping the foreground elements and making the central bar scene larger. The man, initially leaning on the counter, sits up to drink while remaining in his central position.",
