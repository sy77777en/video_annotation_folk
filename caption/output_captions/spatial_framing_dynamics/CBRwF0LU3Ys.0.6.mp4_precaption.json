    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A half red and half blue SUV, with snow covering its top, is seen from a high angle as it drifts around a curve on a snow-covered road. The vehicle kicks up a large, thick plume of white snow, which partially envelops its rear. The driver's door features \"30\u00b0\" written in red inside a white circle, along with other designs and texts that are not visible. In the background, further down the road, a camp tent is located on the right side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a scene in a vast, snow-covered landscape during the daytime. A winding track is carved through the deep white snow, bordered in the distance by a sparse forest of evergreen trees. The low sun casts a bright glare across the scene. A vehicle drifts around a curve on the track, kicking up a large, dense cloud of powdered snow that follows in its wake. Further down the curved path, a tent is visible in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This video begins with a high-angle wide shot, placing a white SUV in the center middle ground as it drifts around a curve on a snow-covered road. In the top-right background, a tent is visible further down the path. The camera then swoops forward and down, following the vehicle and transitioning into a full shot at a lower angle, closer to the subject's level. As the shot progresses, the SUV remains in the center of the frame, moving away from its initial position while becoming increasingly obscured by the large cloud of snow it kicks up behind it.",
