    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a residential scenery shot of a quiet, sun-drenched street in a Japanese suburb. The scene is characterized by modern two-story houses with clean, geometric lines and a mix of grey and white siding, contrasted with older, more traditional homes in the background. Several vehicles, including a white minivan and a black minivan under a translucent carport. Along the road, there are three vehicles: a silver minivan, a black car, and a small white utility truck. The environment is punctuated by everyday details like a prominent concrete utility pole, a red fire hydrant box, a convex traffic mirror, and a web of power lines against a clear blue sky. There is no single main subject, as the camera's slow pan is intended to capture the overall tranquil atmosphere and the specific architectural character of the neighborhood, focusing on the environment itself rather than any particular object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, pans slowly from right to left along a quiet residential street in Japan on a bright, sunny day. The scene is dominated by modern two-story houses, one of which has a grey upper floor and a white lower level with a wooden front door. A narrow paved road runs between the homes, where several cars are parked, including both a black and a white van under a carport with a translucent, arched roof. Directly across from the carport, three cars\u2014a silver, black, and white\u2014are parked. A prominent grey utility pole stands near a small red box on the ground, while an orange pole with a convex traffic mirror is visible on the right. Power lines crisscross the clear blue sky, and a red and white transmission tower can be seen in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective. The shot begins with a modern two-story house occupying the left and center of the frame in the middle ground. A grey utility pole is prominent in the left foreground, with a small red box at its base, while an orange pole with a traffic mirror is in the right foreground. The camera then pans slowly from right to left, shifting the focus from the house to the adjacent street. This movement reveals a carport in the right middle ground containing a white and a black car. The final frame settles on a view down the street, with the carport on the right and other vehicles, including a silver minivan and a white utility truck, parked in the left foreground and middle ground.",
