    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a grey train observation car, shown from both the exterior and interior. Inside the dimly lit car, numerous identical mannequins are seated in rows of dark, high-backed chairs. These humanoid figures have a smooth, reflective, chrome-like surface and lack any discernible facial features. All the mannequins are posed sitting upright, looking out the large panoramic windows.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a grey train car with a dark stripe traveling on tracks through a green, hilly landscape with trees during the day. The scene transitions from an exterior view to the interior of an observation car, which is dimly lit and features large, panoramic windows. Inside, rows of high-backed chairs are occupied by metallic, humanoid figures looking out at the passing scenery. A central pillar stands in the middle of the car. An overlay at the bottom left corner of the frame displays the text \"[2].\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of a moving train, capturing its last carriage from the outside. The camera then transitions inside, revealing a room filled with mannequins sitting while a natural landscape passes by outside.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a train's observation car, positioned in the middle ground and moving from right to left. The camera, positioned at a slightly low angle, pans left to follow the car, with train tracks visible in the bottom-left foreground and a hilly landscape in the background. The scene then cuts to a static, wide interior shot from inside the car, filmed at the eye level of the seated figures. A mannequin in a chair occupies the left foreground. In the middle ground, a large pillar stands in the center of the frame, flanked by rows of seated mannequins on the left and right, creating a sense of depth that leads to the back of the car. The background consists of the passing landscape, visible through large panoramic windows that line the sides of the car.",
