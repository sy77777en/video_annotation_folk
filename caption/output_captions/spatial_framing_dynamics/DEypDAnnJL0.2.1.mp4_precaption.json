    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with long, voluminous curly hair, featuring darker brown roots and lighter brown lengths, is shown from the back and in profile. She is wearing a white, textured sweater. The video shows her turning and bending down towards a white air vent located low on a light-colored wall. Her face is only partially visible throughout the sequence.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a brightly lit indoor hallway with light-colored walls and light wood-look flooring. A person with long, curly, light-brown hair turns and bends down towards a white, rectangular air return vent with vertical slats, which is situated low on the wall. In the latter part of the video, the camera pans and tilts to reveal a white door with a silver doorknob on the right. In the background, another light-colored wall can be seen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of a woman in profile, with her head and shoulders occupying the center-left of the frame in the foreground. The camera is positioned at her level. As she turns away and bends down, the camera tilts down and pans slightly right to follow her movement. This action transitions the scene to a medium shot from a high angle, looking down at the woman. In the final framing, she is positioned in the bottom-left foreground, facing a white air vent located in the center middle ground. A white door with a silver doorknob is visible in the right middle ground.",
