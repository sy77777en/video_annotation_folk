    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a track and field event in an indoor stadium. In the foreground, athletes are running on a curved track. Initially, a man in a blue uniform is positioned on the right, running ahead of others. To his left, three other athletes in white, blue, and black uniforms are further behind. As the video progresses, the athletes move from the right to the left of the frame, maintaining their positions relative to each other. The track, marked with white lines, curves from the bottom right to the top left. In the background, spectators fill the tiered seating, with some sections more populated than others. The stadium features bright lighting, colorful banners, and digital screens displaying event information. Signboards, including a prominent \"SEIKO\" sign, line the track. The camera remains at the athletes' level throughout, capturing the dynamic movement and vibrant atmosphere of the competition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features several athletes running on a track. The most prominent subject is a man in a blue athletic outfit, sprinting energetically. He is positioned towards the right side of the track. Another athlete, wearing a white and blue outfit, is behind the first one. A third runner, in a yellow and black outfit, is positioned behind the second one. Additionally, a fourth athlete, wearing a red outfit, can be seen near the left side of the track. All subjects are focused on the race, displaying determined expressions. The scene captures the intensity and competitive nature of a track event.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor athletic stadium during a track event, likely a championship, as indicated by the signage. The setting is a large, modern arena with tiered seating filled with spectators. The track is a standard red running surface with marked lanes. The time of day is likely daytime, as the stadium is well-lit, though artificial lighting may also be present. The weather is clear, with no visible signs of rain or adverse conditions. The scene includes athletes in motion, running along the track, with officials and equipment visible near the sidelines. The environment is vibrant, with colorful banners and digital screens displaying event information, contributing to the dynamic atmosphere of the competition.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
