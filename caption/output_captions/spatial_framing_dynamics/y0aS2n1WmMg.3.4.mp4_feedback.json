    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot. A man is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, holding a camcorder that is also in the center of the frame but in the foreground, with its viewfinder to his eye. A lampshade is partially visible in the top left of the frame and in the background. The spatial framing of these elements remains static throughout the shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark hair pulled back and stubble is shown in a close-up, looking directly forward with wide eyes. He is holding a light-grey camcorder with \"DIGITAL\" printed on its side, and he appears to be looking through its viewfinder. Partially visible above and to the left of his head is a dark, tilted lampshade with a lightbulb inside.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to an object, keeping its perspective fixed to that object, shows a dimly lit indoor setting. A black, cylindrical lampshade with a visible lightbulb is partially visible in the upper left. The primary focus is on a person holding a white camcorder with a black viewfinder, which has \"DIGITAL\" printed on it. The person's eyes widen during the shot. The overall lighting is dark, creating a shadowy atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
