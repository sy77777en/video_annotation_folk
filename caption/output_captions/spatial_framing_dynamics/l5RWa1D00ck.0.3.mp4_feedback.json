    "pre_caption": "A medium close-up shot centers on a woman against a dark background. The camera then executes a smooth counterclockwise arc around her. As the camera moves, the out-of-focus background shifts, first revealing the silhouette of a large building in the middle ground, followed by a row of vintage trucks. The woman remains the central focus throughout the movement, her position transitioning from a frontal view to a profile, then briefly to a three-quarter back view, before settling back into a profile. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young adult woman with long, wavy, light-colored hair is shown in a low-light, blue-toned setting. Her hair is styled with the top section pulled back from her face. She wears a light-colored, sleeveless dress with a V-neckline and a draped bodice. The camera arcs counterclockwise around her, capturing her from various angles. Her eyes are closed, and her head is tilted back as if she is taking a deep breath or is in a state of serene contemplation. Eventually, she opens her mouth and smiles joyfully.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors in the early morning or the evening, enveloped in a deep, cool-toned blue light. In the softly out-of-focus background, the dark silhouette of a large building with windows is faintly visible against the dim sky, alongside indistinct trees and a blurred forest. A row of large, light-colored vintage trucks is also present in the background, their forms blurred and softened by the low, atmospheric lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
