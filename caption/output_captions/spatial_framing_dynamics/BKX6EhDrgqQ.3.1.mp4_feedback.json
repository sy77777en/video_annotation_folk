    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a self-ordering kiosk screen, which occupies the majority of the frame in the middle ground. On the left side of this screen, a vertical menu is positioned in the middle ground. The main area of the screen, to the right of the vertical menu, displays larger menu category tiles, also in the middle ground. A white, polygonal, humanoid figure is partially visible on the right edge of the frame, in the middle ground. The text \"DW News Germany\" is overlaid in the bottom left corner, in the foreground. As the video progresses, the camera moves slightly forward and tilts downward. This movement shifts the focus to the lower portion of the kiosk screen, which remains in the middle ground. In this new view, the total amount \"19,97\u20ac\" appears at the bottom center of the screen. Below this, a \"Cancel Order\" button is on the bottom left, and an \"Add to your order\" button is on the bottom right, with \"Accessible View\" text beneath them, all in the middle ground. The polygonal figure remains partially visible on the right edge, and the \"DW News Germany\" overlay stays in the bottom left foreground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a close-up of a McDonald's self-ordering kiosk screen, initially displaying various menu categories as large tiles with images, including \"Burgers,\" \"Filet-o-Fish,\" \"Happy Meal,\" \"Double Hamburger Royale,\" \"McMenu,\" and \"Desserts.\" A vertical menu with smaller icons and text for categories like \"Our Menu,\" \"Highlights,\" and \"Drinks\" is visible on the left side of the screen. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward and downward, revealing content originally located below the kiosk screen. This includes a predominantly white background where the total amount \"19,97\u20ac\" appears in black text at the bottom center. Below the total, a light gray \"Cancel Order\" button with white text is on the left, and a yellow \"Add to your order\" button with white text is on the right, with smaller gray \"Accessible View\" text beneath it. Partially visible on the right edge of the video is a white, polygonal, humanoid figure facing the screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an objective POV shot of a self-service ordering kiosk screen, likely in a McDonald's restaurant. The large, white, vertical touchscreen displays a digital menu. A narrow sidebar on the left lists food categories such as \"Our Menu,\" \"Highlights,\" \"McMenu,\" \"Burger,\" \"McNuggets & Fingerfood,\" \"McPlant,\" \"Happy Meal,\" \"Sides & Extras,\" \"Drinks,\" \"Desserts,\" and \"McCafe,\" each accompanied by a small icon. The main area of the screen initially features larger tiles with images and text for categories like \"Burgers,\" \"Filet-o-Fish,\" \"Happy Meal,\" \"Double Hamburger Royale,\" \"McMenu,\" and \"Desserts.\" As the view shifts downwards, the bottom of the screen reveals a total price of \"19,97\u20ac\" in black text, alongside a white \"Cancel Order\" button and a yellow \"Add to your order\" button. Below these, \"Accessible View\" is written in smaller grey text. The background is blurred, suggesting a clean, modern interior with a hint of a red object. A blurry, animated human figure is partially visible on the right side of the screen. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"DW News Germany.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
