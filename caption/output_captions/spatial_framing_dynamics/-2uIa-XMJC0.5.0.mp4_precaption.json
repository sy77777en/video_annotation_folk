    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with light skin stands on a skateboard. She is dressed in all-white attire, consisting of a tank top, pants that end below the knee, and a white beanie. A patterned prosthetic is visible on her right leg from the knee down. Throughout the video, she adjusts her balance on the skateboard, at one point extending her arms out to her sides. The skateboard is dark with light-colored wheels.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a scene on the exterior of a modern skyscraper. The building features large, reflective glass panels set in a metallic frame. In the background, a vast, futuristic cityscape with numerous tall, uniquely designed buildings stretches to the horizon, bisected by a wide river with several bridges. The scene is set in the late afternoon, with the sun casting a warm glow and reflecting off the glass surfaces. A person dressed in white is seen skateboarding along a narrow, dark ledge that protrudes from the side of the building, high above the city below.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera starts below the subject. As the subject jumps off the platform, the camera appears above her, then lowers to match the subject\u2019s height.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium-long shot, framing a woman in the center of the screen who is standing on a skateboard in the middle ground. She is on a small platform protruding from the glass facade of a skyscraper, which dominates the frame. The futuristic cityscape is visible as a reflection in the glass panels behind her and as a vast background element. The camera, initially positioned below the subject, follows her as she skates toward the right and jumps down to a lower, longer ledge that extends into the foreground. During this movement, the camera pulls back into a wide shot, briefly moving above her before lowering to match her height. This camera movement pans right, revealing more of the cityscape in the background and repositioning the woman on the left side of the frame as she lands on the new ledge in the middle ground.",
