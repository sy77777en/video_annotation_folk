    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the video, a yellowish biplane with white wings enters the frame from the bottom, ascending along a curved trajectory. It moves vertically upward while initially shifting left horizontally, then turns to fly right, gradually moving away from the camera, forming an upward curve across the scene. Positioned on the right side, atop a cluster of large, greyish-brown rocks, stands a tall, cylindrical white lighthouse. The lighthouse features several windows and some dark patches indicating wear or damage. A small, white building with a dark roof is situated at the base of the lighthouse. To the right of this small building, a dark, military-style vehicle is parked amongst the rocks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a biplane entering the frame from the bottom, ascending along a curved trajectory in a clear blue sky over a sun-drenched, arid, rocky landscape. The plane initially shifts to the left before turning to the right, creating a dynamic sense of spatial depth as it follows an upward curve across the scene. In the foreground, large, weathered grey boulders cover a hilly terrain leading up to a tall, cylindrical, white lighthouse with a few dark, damaged patches on its surface and a visible lantern room at the top. A small, white, rectangular building with a dark roof sits at the base of the lighthouse. In the distance, hazy, light brown mountains stretch across the horizon under the bright sky, with a single, small, white cloud visible. As the plane gradually flies away, its size diminishes within the frame, enhancing the perception of distance.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an aircraft flying in the sky, with a prominent lighthouse and some big rocks in the scene. The aircraft starts on the left side of the frame, partially visible, occupying 50% of the height, and as it flies forward, it gradually becomes fully visible and gets smaller. Eventually, it occupies about 5% of the frame\u2019s height, positioned in the upper left part of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an aircraft partially visible in the bottom left foreground, occupying 50% of the frame's height. It ascends, initially shifting left before curving to the right and receding into the middle ground, diminishing in size until it occupies about 5% of the frame\u2019s height in the upper left. A tall, white lighthouse stands prominently on the right side of the frame in the middle ground, with a small building and a dark vehicle at its base, also in the middle ground. Large, greyish-brown rocks dominate the foreground and extend into the middle ground across the bottom half of the frame. In the background, hazy, light brown mountains stretch across the horizon, beneath a clear blue sky that fills the upper portion of the frame, where a single, small, white cloud is visible in the center-right. The camera is initially positioned at the aircraft's level and then changes to below the aircraft as it flies upward.",
