    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man is shown in a close-up profile view, facing towards the left. He has short, dark, wavy hair combed back from his forehead. He wears a dark-colored suit jacket, with his left side initially facing the camera. As the video progresses, his body gradually shifts, and his right shoulder and back turn towards the viewer. His lips remain closed, and his gaze is directed off-screen to the left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The setting is ambiguous, with a dark, possibly deep green, backdrop that could be a curtain or wall. In the background, a piece of furniture with a pattern of dark green and light green fabric is partially visible. A \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" watermark is present as an overlay in the bottom left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium close-up shot initially frames a man slightly right of center in the foreground, his left profile facing towards the left. A piece of patterned furniture is visible in the right background, and a watermark is overlaid in the bottom left foreground. The man then shifts his body, turning his right shoulder and back more towards the viewer, while his gaze remains fixed off-screen to the left and his position within the frame stays relatively constant. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
