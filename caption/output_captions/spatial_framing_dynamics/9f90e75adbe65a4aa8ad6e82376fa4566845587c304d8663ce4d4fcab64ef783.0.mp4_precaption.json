    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man with thick, curly, two-toned hair\u2014black with reddish-brown highlights\u2014is shown from the chest up. He has a short beard and mustache, a small silver hoop earring and a round stud in both ears, and a nose ring in his left nostril. He is wearing a white hoodie underneath a tan jacket. He maintains a neutral expression while looking up and to his left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors during the daytime under a bright, overcast sky. In the background, a distant city skyline with several skyscrapers is faintly visible. Bare, leafless tree branches are positioned on both sides of the man. A young man with curly, two-toned hair stands in the foreground, looking upward. The camera moves in a counterclockwise arc slowly, causing the background elements, including the trees and the city skyline, to shift position relative to the man. The tree on the right side of the frame initially appears and then disappears, while the tree on the left side gradually comes into view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground. In the background, a distant city skyline is visible across the bottom of the frame, with a bare tree branch on the right. The camera performs a slow, counterclockwise arc around the man, causing his position to shift from the center to the right side of the frame. During this movement, the tree branch on the right moves out of view, while a larger, leafless tree enters from the left and moves toward the center. The city skyline in the background shifts from left to right relative to the man. The camera is positioned at the man's level.",
