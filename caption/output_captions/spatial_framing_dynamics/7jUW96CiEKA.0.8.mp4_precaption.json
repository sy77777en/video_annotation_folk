    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a vast, open expanse of dry, barren land with sparse patches of vegetation. The sky is overcast with a thick layer of clouds, allowing only a hint of blue to peek through. The horizon is lined with distant trees, creating a sense of depth and scale. The focus is on the expansive environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the vastness and emptiness of the landscape rather than any specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a wide, flat expanse of dry, sandy ground dotted with sparse, low green vegetation. In the background, a line of green trees stretches across the horizon under a mostly overcast sky filled with greyish-white clouds, though some patches of blue are visible. The setting is outdoors during the daytime.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot of a landscape. The foreground and middle ground feature a flat expanse of dry, sandy ground with sparse vegetation, occupying the lower portion of the frame. A line of trees stretches horizontally across the background. The overcast sky fills the upper portion of the frame. The camera remains static throughout the clip, positioned at a low height relative to the ground.",
