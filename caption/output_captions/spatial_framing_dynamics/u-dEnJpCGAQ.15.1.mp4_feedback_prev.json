    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot frames a leopard in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. In the out-of-focus background, dark foliage is visible in the top left and center, with a wooden post positioned in the top right. The camera is positioned at the leopard's level, and the shot remains static throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A leopard is shown in a close-up view, lying down and looking directly forward. Its coat is a yellowish-tan color, covered in a pattern of black spots and rosettes. The big cat has intense, amber-colored eyes, a pink nose, and long, white whiskers extending from its muzzle. Its ears are perked up, and dappled sunlight casts patches of light and shadow across its face and body.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A leopard is shown in a close-up view, situated in an outdoor setting during the day. Dappled sunlight filters through an unseen canopy, casting patches of light and shadow across its tawny, spotted coat and face. The animal looks directly forward with amber-colored eyes. In the out-of-focus background, there are hints of blue sky, dark foliage, and a thick, brown wooden post, suggesting a naturalistic enclosure or a wooded area.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
