    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up of a person with medium to dark skin tone, focusing on their face. The individual has short hair and is seen in low lighting, which casts shadows across their features. The person's eye is prominently highlighted, reflecting some light, adding a sense of depth to the scene. The lighting creates a warm, intimate atmosphere, emphasizing the details of the person's facial features. The video captures the subject in a still, contemplative pose, with the focus primarily on their eye and surrounding facial area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit environment, possibly at night, with a focus on a close-up view of a person's face. The lighting is low, casting soft shadows and highlighting the contours of the face. The background is dark, providing little context about the surroundings. The person's eye is prominently featured, reflecting small points of light, suggesting nearby illumination or distant city lights. The texture of the skin and subtle details like eyelashes are visible, adding depth to the scene. The overall atmosphere is intimate and focused, with minimal external elements to distract from the central subject.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It Lacks background information, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a person's face, positioned centrally in the frame, occupying the foreground. The lighting is low, casting shadows that emphasize the contours of the face. The background is dark, providing minimal context. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to an extreme close-up, focusing on the person's eye, which is now positioned slightly to the right of the center. This change in shot size enhances the detail of the eye, capturing reflections of light within it. The camera maintains a consistent height relative to the subject, focusing on the facial features without revealing the background, keeping the viewer's attention on the intimate details of the face.",
