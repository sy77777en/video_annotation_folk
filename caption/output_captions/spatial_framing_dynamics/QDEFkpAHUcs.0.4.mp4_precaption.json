    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up of an aged hand, visible with wrinkles, gently moving away from the lower half of an ornate wine glass until it disappears from the left side of the frame. The focus then shifts along a row of wine glasses, extending from the foreground to the background, reflecting soft light and creating a warm ambiance. In the background, a person, likely a waiter, becomes clearly visible as he crouches down to inspect the alignment of the glasses. Dressed in a formal outfit, including a white chef's hat and a colorful striped uniform, he suggests a professional setting. His posture indicates attentiveness as he ensures the glasses are perfectly organized, with most of his body visible in the frame. The overall composition emphasizes the elegance of the table setting and the meticulous nature of the task at hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases an elegant dining setting with a long, ornate table adorned with shimmering silverware and delicate glassware, reflecting warm, ambient light. A close-up captures a hand reaching for a golden serving piece, highlighting intricate details, before transitioning to a wider view of the lavish arrangement. The indoor setting, likely a grand hall, features rich wooden paneling and soft, glowing lights, creating a warm atmosphere. A neatly arranged row of wine glasses and a line of elegant red chairs enhance the scene, while a lavish decorative piece adorns the wooden wall in the background. The polished silver gleams against the muted tablecloth, and the elegant glassware features subtle curves and intricate designs, conveying opulence and refinement. The camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video first focuses on a close-up of a person's hand and the lower half of a wine glass in the foreground. Through a rack focus from the foreground to the background, it shows the neatly arranged wine glasses on the table. The focus eventually stays on the background, where a person, likely a waiter, is seen organizing the glasses. Most of his body is visible as he crouches down, seemingly inspecting the alignment of the glasses.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of an aged hand in the foreground, positioned in the bottom left of the frame, gently moving away from the lower half of an ornate wine glass. As the hand exits the frame to the left, the focus shifts along a row of wine glasses extending from the foreground to the background, positioned centrally and slightly to the right. The camera maintains a level height with the subjects. The focus transitions to the background, where a person, likely a waiter, is visible in the top left, crouching down to inspect the alignment of the glasses. His body occupies the middle ground, with most of it visible, indicating attentiveness to the task. The scene captures the elegance of the table setting, with the wine glasses reflecting soft light, creating a warm ambiance. The camera's perspective remains observational, emphasizing the meticulous organization of the dining setup.",
