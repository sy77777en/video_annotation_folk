    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white, unmarked passenger airplane is shown on an airport taxiway. The aircraft is a twin-engine jet, with its engines mounted in pods beneath the wings. It features a standard tail assembly and winglets that curve upwards at the tips of the main wings. The entire exterior of the plane, including the fuselage, wings, and tail, is a uniform white color, lacking any airline livery, registration numbers, or other distinguishing marks. The airplane is positioned on a dark, paved surface with yellow guidance lines, appearing to be in the process of making a turn.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A white, unmarked passenger airplane is positioned on a dark asphalt taxiway at an airport. The scene takes place under a dusky, reddish-orange sky, indicating either dawn or twilight. Yellow lines mark the curved path on the taxiway, which the aircraft is navigating. In the blurred background, the simple, blocky silhouettes of airport structures are visible against the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures a white, unmarked airplane positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The airplane is situated on a dark, curved taxiway marked with yellow lines, which extends from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground. In the background, indistinct airport buildings are visible on the left, set against a dusky sky that fills the top portion of the frame. A concrete ledge occupies the immediate foreground at the bottom edge of the shot. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the entire scene remains static.",
