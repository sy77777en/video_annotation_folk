    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit, cluttered room, a young girl, depicted as a stop-motion puppet, sits in the foreground. She has dark skin, and her black hair is styled in two braids. Her most prominent and atypical feature is her eyes, which are large, round, and completely dark, appearing as hollow sockets without pupils or irises. She wears a simple, sleeveless, off-white dress and is seated cross-legged on the floor, holding an open book. In the background, another puppet figure of a woman is seated. This woman also has dark skin and the same large, hollow, dark eyes. She wears a reddish-brown top and is engaged in an activity with her hands.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a single, dimly lit room with a rough, uneven floor. The space is cluttered with an assortment of household items, including pots, a green and white bucket, and woven baskets, all rendered in dark, earthy tones of brown and gray. A warm light source in the background casts a soft glow, leaving much of the room in shadow. In the foreground, a puppet of a young girl in a light-colored dress sits on the floor, holding a small book with visible musical notes on its pages. A second puppet is visible in the out-of-focus background, seated among the various objects that fill the space.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A full shot frames a young girl puppet sitting in the center foreground on a cluttered floor. To her left in the foreground is a small woven basket. In the center background, a second puppet of a woman is seated out of focus. Various household items, including a green and white bucket on the right, are scattered throughout the middle ground and background. A light source is visible in the left background. The girl, initially holding a book in her lap, lifts it closer to her face. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level.",
