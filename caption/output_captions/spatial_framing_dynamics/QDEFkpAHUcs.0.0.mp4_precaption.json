    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on an extreme, out-of-focus close-up of a person's ear and the side of their head, which has dark hair, with a textured, golden object visible near the earlobe. The scene then resolves to show a line of men in profile, facing to the right. These men, appearing to be soldiers in ceremonial dress, wear tall, black, furry hats. A prominent, gold-colored, braided chain-link strap is fastened under each man's chin. They have fair skin and are clean-shaven, maintaining neutral expressions while standing at attention. A portion of their uniform is visible, showing a high white collar and a red tunic.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit setting with a dark, indistinct background, a row of soldiers stands in profile, wearing tall, black, furry hats with golden chin straps descending from them. These straps, composed of interlocking, flat, metallic links, are positioned under their lower lips. The scene is captured with an extremely shallow depth of field, utilizing a rack focus technique. Initially, the image is out of focus, then shifts to focus on the soldiers in the foreground, and subsequently on those in the middleground, while the background remains consistently blurred. The focused lighting accentuates the metallic sheen of the chin straps and the contours of the soldiers' faces.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme close-up, presenting a heavily blurred image of a person's head and a golden object on the left side of the frame. The shot then transitions to a close-up as a rack focus reveals a line of soldiers in profile. The first soldier is positioned in the foreground on the left, with the line extending diagonally into the middle ground and background toward the right. The focus initially sharpens on the foreground soldier, after which it racks to the soldier in the middle ground, bringing him into focus while the foreground soldier becomes blurred. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
