    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two individuals in tactical gear move cautiously while holding black rifles. They are wearing black helmets and full-face gas masks with large, orange-tinted visors. Their uniforms include brownish-green jackets under tactical vests of similar color, with solid blue square patches on the left shoulders. They are also wearing black gloves.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a stark, enclosed space defined by large, grey concrete block walls. The environment is cast in a dim, cool-toned light. To the left, a large, rough-textured rock or debris formation contrasts with the smooth, flat surface of the concrete wall on the right. A figure wearing a helmet, gas mask, and tactical vest is present, moving behind the broken wall for cover, followed by another individual.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a person in tactical gear positioned in the middle ground on the right, with a large rock formation occupying the foreground on the left. The person moves left, taking cover behind the rock, which causes the framing to tighten into a medium close-up. They end their movement on the left side of the frame, partially concealed by the foreground rock, while a concrete wall remains in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
