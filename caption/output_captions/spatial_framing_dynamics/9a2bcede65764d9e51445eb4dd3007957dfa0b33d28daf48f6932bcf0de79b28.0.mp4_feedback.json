    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of Independence Hall. Initially, a green lawn occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The red-brick Independence Hall is centered in the middle ground, with a statue on a pedestal positioned centrally in front of it. An American flag on a flagpole is located in the left middle ground, while trees flank the building on both the left and right. In the background, modern skyscrapers are visible behind the historic structure, with the sky at the top of the frame. The camera, positioned at a low angle, slowly tilts upward, causing the lawn to move out of the bottom of the frame while revealing more of the building's clock tower and the skyscrapers behind it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, focusing on the architectural grandeur of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The camera slowly tilts upwards, showcasing the historic red-brick building with its white-trimmed windows, central clock tower, and a statue in the middle ground, all set against a backdrop of modern skyscrapers and a clear sky. An American flag flies to the left of the building. There is no single main subject, as the shot aims to capture the overall environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the scale of the landmark and its place within the urban landscape, rather than a specific object or individual. The manicured green lawn in the immediate foreground and the symmetrical arcades flanking the main structure contribute to the sense of place and historical significance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene at Independence Hall in Philadelphia is captured at either dawn or dusk. The central focus is the large, two-story red-brick building, designed in the Georgian style, featuring numerous white-trimmed windows, a white balustrade along the roofline, and a prominent central clock tower topped with a steeple. The main building is flanked by lower, matching brick wings with open, arched colonnades. In the foreground, a manicured green lawn is separated from a paved plaza by a low fence with brown posts and chains. A bronze statue of a figure stands on a stone pedestal in the center of the plaza. To the left, an American flag is raised on a tall flagpole. In the background, the historical architecture contrasts with modern glass and stone skyscrapers and is framed by lush green trees. The view slowly tilts upward, revealing the full height of the clock tower against the pale sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
