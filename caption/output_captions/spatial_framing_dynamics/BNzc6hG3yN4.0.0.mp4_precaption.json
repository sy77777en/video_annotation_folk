    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of young men are positioned on and around a black sedan. A man in the center wears a black varsity jacket with white details, a black baseball cap, and a black face mask covering his lower face. To the left of the frame, a light-skinned man reclines on the trunk of the car, wearing a black jacket, dark pants, white shoes, and a short beard. Next to him, a dark-skinned man dressed entirely in black, wearing a hood, is lighting a cigarette. A dark-skinned man in a gray T-shirt and ripped blue jeans is sitting on the roof of the car, making exaggerated movements. A person with long hair in a bun and a black hat stands by the open front door. Inside the car, two figures are visible: in the back seat, someone in a black hoodie and white sneakers sits sideways with their legs outside the vehicle, while the person in the front seat is also dressed in black. Additionally, several other individuals dressed in dark clothing are visible in the background, engaging in conversation on the sidewalk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an urban setting during the daytime, a group of men in dark clothing are gathered around a black sedan parked on an asphalt street. Large, multi-story brick apartment buildings are visible in the background under an overcast sky. Some of the men are sitting on the car's trunk and roof, while another has the driver's side door open. The camera transitions from a street-level view to a bird's-eye view, and then to a high-angle perspective, effectively showing the scene in reverse, capturing the group and the car from directly above on the cracked pavement.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In an initial full shot, a group of men and a car are positioned in the middle ground, centered within the frame. A man in a varsity jacket stands at the center, with two men sitting on the car's trunk to the left and another man sitting on the car's roof at the top center. Other individuals are positioned around the open car door on the right. Large apartment buildings occupy the background across the top of the frame. The camera, initially at the subjects' level, abruptly transitions to an extreme high-angle, bird's-eye view. In this final composition, the car is centered, and the men are now lying down on the car and the surrounding pavement, arranged as if radiating outwards from the vehicle.",
