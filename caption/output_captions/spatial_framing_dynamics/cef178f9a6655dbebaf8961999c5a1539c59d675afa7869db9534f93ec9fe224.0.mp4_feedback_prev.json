    "pre_caption": "This wide scenery shot is captured from a static, low-angle perspective in the middle of a street, focusing on the urban environment rather than a specific subject. The dark asphalt road fills the bottom of the frame, creating leading lines that draw the eye toward the background. Tall buildings line the left and right sides, framing the scene and converging toward a distant domed building positioned in the center background. The upper portion of the frame shows the sky, with a flag flying from a building in the top right. Throughout the shot, various vehicles, including cars, a red double-decker bus, and vans, continuously enter from the bottom left and right, travel through the middle ground, and recede into the distance toward the center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a low-angle cityscape scenery shot looking down a wide, paved street flanked by grand, multi-story buildings with classical architectural details. Under a bright blue sky, a Union Jack flag flies from a building on the right, and a large multi-level domed building with an arched entrance is visible in the distance, while a steady stream of traffic, including black cabs, a red double-decker bus, and other cars, moves away from the camera. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the grand scale of the urban environment and the dynamic atmosphere of city life. The low perspective emphasizes the height of the buildings and the expanse of the street, immersing the viewer in the scene. The shot is designed to convey a sense of place rather than to follow a specific object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective in the middle of a wide London street, traffic flows away from the camera during the daytime. The road is lined on both sides by tall, classical stone buildings that rise against a bright blue sky with a few wisps of clouds. A Union Jack flag is visible flying from a flagpole on one of the buildings on the right. A variety of vehicles, including iconic red double-decker buses, black taxis, vans, and passenger cars, travel down the dark asphalt road toward a distant multi-level domed building with an arched entrance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
