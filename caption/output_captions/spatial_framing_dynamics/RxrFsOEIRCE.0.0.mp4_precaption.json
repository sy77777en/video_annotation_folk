    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a high-speed, low-altitude journey across a vibrant, sunlit countryside. The view sweeps over rolling green hills and fields under a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds, with the rapid forward motion creating a dynamic blur that emphasizes the feeling of flight. There is no main subject, as the focus is on conveying the immersive experience and the vast, open scale of the natural environment rather than highlighting a specific entity. The shadow of what appears to be a drone is briefly visible against the grass, suggesting the perspective is from a fast-moving aerial vehicle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a high-speed flight low over a sunlit, rural landscape. The drone follows a light brown dirt path that winds up a rolling hill covered in vibrant green grass. On either side of the path are lush fields and clusters of leafy green trees under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The rapid forward movement creates a pronounced motion blur, and the shadow of the drone is visible on the ground as it speeds across the terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot with no main subject, captured from a very low-altitude perspective. Initially, a dirt path is positioned in the bottom center foreground, extending into the middle ground between rolling green hills. Trees are visible in the middle ground on both the left and right sides, with the sky and clouds occupying the top background. The camera moves forward at high speed, creating a strong motion blur effect. It first follows the path before veering left and ascending a steep green hill, which comes to dominate the foreground and middle ground. As the camera climbs, the horizon tilts, and the drone's shadow becomes visible moving across the grass in the bottom right foreground.",
