    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle, first-person perspective. The video begins with a stone-paved walkway occupying the foreground and middle ground, leading from the bottom of the frame toward the center-background where the sun is rising. An old building is positioned in the left foreground, while the large metal structure of a bridge dominates the right side of the frame, extending from the middle ground into the background. As the camera moves steadily forward along the path, the building on the left gradually moves out of the frame, and the perspective shifts to bring the bridge and the walkway ahead into greater focus. The bright sun in the background creates a strong backlight, casting long shadows across the pavement toward the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a sun-drenched, empty stone slab street leading towards a large, intricate metal arch bridge. An old, multi-story building with a small balcony lines the left side of the street, while the massive structure of the bridge dominates the right. The video lacks a main subject because its focus is on capturing the atmosphere and sense of place. The level-angle perspective and the bright, glaring sun create long shadows and a prominent lens flare, emphasizing the quiet, early morning mood of the historic urban environment rather than a specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a walk along a wide, stone-slab-paved walkway in Porto, Portugal, during what appears to be sunrise. The path approaches the large, grey, arched metal structure of the Dom Lu\u00eds I Bridge. On the left, an old building features a mix of light and dark areas on its facade, with a balcony that has a black metal railing and yellow flowers. Bright, golden sunlight shines from the horizon, creating a strong backlight, casting long shadows across the pavement, and producing a prominent lens flare. A red traffic light is visible on a pole to the right, relatively close to the bridge.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
