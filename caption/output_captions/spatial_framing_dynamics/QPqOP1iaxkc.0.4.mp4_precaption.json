    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a man and a woman sitting slightly left of center on a park bench, facing away from the viewer. They are looking out over a body of water towards a city skyline and a bridge in the distance, silhouetted against the bright, low sun. The man, on the left, wears a dark jacket and is gesturing with his hands, suggesting communication. The woman, on the right, wears a dark coat and a light-colored beanie or hat. They are sitting close together.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene along a waterfront during a bright afternoon approaching sunset, under sunny, clear skies. Two silhouetted figures are seated on a dark bench positioned on a paved area near the water's edge, which is lined with large rocks. Across the wide expanse of water, the New York City skyline is visible in the distance, prominently featuring the Williamsburg Bridge to the left and the spire of One World Trade Center. The intense reflection of bright sunlight on the river's surface creates shimmering ripples that dance across the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot featuring a man and a woman seated on a bench. The bench and the subjects are positioned in the foreground, slightly left of center in the bottom half of the frame. Rocks are visible along the bottom edge, also in the foreground. A body of water occupies the middle ground, stretching horizontally across the center of the frame, with a bright sun reflection prominent on its left side. In the background, a bridge extends from the top left towards the center, while a city skyline is visible across the center and right side along the horizon. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level and remains static throughout the shot.",
