    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a light-skinned arm with a large, dark tattoo on the forearm holds a black camera, pointing it toward a street scene. On the right, a man with short, dark hair wearing a blue polo shirt and a woman with dark, shoulder-length hair in a patterned dress are seated facing each other at a small outdoor table, eating. Back-to-back with the woman with dark, shoulder-length hair, another woman with long, brown hair in a blue denim jacket sits at a separate table, looking at her phone. Walking on the sidewalk toward the camera is a woman with long, blonde hair, wearing a blue top and jeans. To the left, a black motorcycle is parked on the street adjacent to the sidewalk next to a large tree, and a silver and black fire hydrant is visible in the foreground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a sunny, late-afternoon city street. The warm, golden light casts long shadows across the concrete sidewalk, where a green-leafed tree grows next to an outdoor dining area adjacent to a glass-enclosed structure. On the right, a restaurant with a black awning and a mural has patrons seated at outdoor tables. The scene includes brick buildings with fire escapes, a parked black motorcycle, and a silver and black fire hydrant in the middle ground. Two arms, one tattooed, are visible raising a black camera, framing the view of pedestrians on the sidewalk.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person, eye-level perspective, the scene initially captures a wide view of a city street. A silver and black fire hydrant is positioned in the bottom-left foreground. In the middle ground, a black motorcycle is parked on the left, next to a large tree in the center-left. To the right of the tree, a restaurant with patrons seated at outdoor tables occupies the right side of the frame. A woman walks toward the camera from the center middle ground. Subsequently, two arms, one with a prominent tattoo on the left and the other on the right, rise from the bottom of the frame, lifting a black camera into the center. This action reframes the shot, with the camera and hands now occupying the central foreground, partially obscuring the original view and creating a frame-within-a-frame effect.",
