    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a bustling street scene outside a shop with several people and bicycles. A woman with long, light brown hair, wearing a tan jacket and black shorts, is walking past the shop. Another woman with long, dark hair, dressed in a white outfit, stands nearby, facing the shop window. A man in a black sweater and dark pants, along with another man in a white shirt, is visible in the background. Several bicycles are parked along the shop's exterior, which is adorned with traditional lanterns and signs. The scene captures a lively and casual atmosphere with people engaged in everyday activities.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a daytime street scene in an outdoor setting, likely in Japan. Pedestrians walk along a paved sidewalk next to traditional-style buildings housing shops. The buildings feature wooden elements and storefronts with glass display cases. Several paper lanterns, both white with red and black characters and yellow/orange with black characters, hang from the eaves. Two white bicycles are parked near one of the shops. Trees with autumn leaves are visible in the background.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot capturing a street scene. On the left side, two men occupy the middle ground, walking towards the right. Two white bicycles are positioned in the center-left middle ground, parked in front of a shop. The shopfront extends across the right half of the frame in the middle ground, adorned with lanterns hanging from the top right/center. A woman in a tan jacket is initially on the right side, middle ground, walking towards the left. Another woman in a white outfit stands on the far right, middle ground, facing towards the right. Trees are visible in the top left background. The camera remains static at approximately eye level with the subjects throughout the short clip.",
