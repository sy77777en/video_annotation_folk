    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a camel lying down, positioned in the foreground and occupying the bottom half of the frame. In the middle ground, the rear of another camel is visible on the far left, while a third camel stands in the center-right, with a blue jug to its left and a hand truck to its right. A rock wall fills the background. The camera, initially positioned at a high angle above the lying camel, tilts upward, reframing the composition into a full shot of the standing camel, which now occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground. The head of the first camel remains at the bottom of the frame in the foreground, and the camera's height becomes level with the standing camel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three camels in a desert setting. The first camel, positioned prominently in the foreground, is lying down with a light brown coat and a decorative yellow and red tassel on its head. It is covered with multiple colorful blankets, featuring various shades and patterns. Initially visible on the left is another camel with a lighter coat, adorned with several colorful blankets. The camera tilts upwards to reveal the third camel, which is standing and facing away from the viewer, revealing its slender legs and a similar saddle blanket.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sandy, rustic enclosure surrounded by rough, earthen rock walls, several camels are resting. The scene is illuminated by the low-angled sun of either early morning or late afternoon, casting distinct shadows. In the foreground, a camel with a decorative harness lies on the ground, its back covered by a brown blanket. To the right, another camel is partially visible, with only the back half of its body exposed, and its blanket is red. Behind them, another camel stands, also saddled with colorful textiles. The background contains a low stone wall, wooden planks, a blue jug, and a hand truck with a scale resting on it. The ground throughout the area is uneven and covered in sand.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned above the subject when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
