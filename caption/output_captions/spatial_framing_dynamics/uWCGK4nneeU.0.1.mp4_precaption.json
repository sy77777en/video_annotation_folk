    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot of an arid, desert environment. A tall, weathered white lighthouse with a dark-roofed lantern room stands centrally on a bed of large, smooth rocks, while the view slowly elevates to reveal a vast expanse of hazy, rolling desert mountains and pale sand dunes stretching to the horizon under a clear, light-blue sky. There is no single main subject, as the focus is placed on the immense scale and desolate atmosphere of the environment. The lighthouse serves as a focal point that accentuates the vastness of the surrounding landscape, making the environment itself the primary subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a low-angle shot looking up at a weathered, cylindrical lighthouse tower, which has a lantern room with a dark-colored roof. The drone then moves upward and forward, slightly panning to the left and tilting downward, transitioning the view from a low angle to a high angle. This reveals a vast, rocky desert landscape behind the lighthouse, characterized by grayish-brown boulders, ridges, and a barren white terrain. Initially, the background features a clear light blue sky, but as the camera continues its movement, the blue sky gradually disappears, leaving only a white sky in the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot focused on a vast desert environment. Initially, a white lighthouse is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground from a low-angle perspective. A bed of large rocks fills the bottom of the frame in the foreground and middle ground, while a clear sky occupies the top background. The camera then executes a continuous upward and forward movement, transitioning the perspective. As it rises, the view changes to a high-angle shot, revealing an expansive landscape of desert mountains and dunes that fills the entire background. Consequently, the lighthouse appears to move lower in the frame, remaining in the center-middle ground, while the amount of visible sky at the top is significantly reduced.",
