    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot of a cityscape, capturing a vibrant urban environment. The scene is framed with a sidewalk on the left and a road on the right. Buildings with a mix of glass and concrete facades line the left side, positioned in the middle ground and background, while trees are interspersed along the sidewalk in the foreground and middle ground. Vehicles, including a white truck, are visible on the road, moving away from the camera, positioned in the middle ground and background. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk, contributing to the dynamic atmosphere. Street signs with Japanese text are mounted on poles, positioned in the foreground and middle ground. The camera is at the height of the pedestrians, providing a first-person perspective of walking through the city. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining the wide shot and spatial arrangement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban environment. The focus is on the bustling street lined with modern buildings, showcasing a mix of architectural styles. The scene includes a variety of elements such as trees, street signs, and vehicles, contributing to the dynamic atmosphere. The presence of pedestrians and moving cars adds to the lively city vibe. The emphasis is on the overall environment and the interaction of urban elements, rather than a specific object, highlighting the scale and energy of city life.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, walking along a city street during the day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a wide sidewalk lined with trees and modern buildings. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting pleasant weather. On the left, buildings with a mix of glass and concrete facades rise, while the right side shows a road with several vehicles moving away from the camera, including a white truck parked at the roadside. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk, and there are signs with Japanese text mounted on poles. The sidewalk is a mix of gray tiles and textured concrete, bordered by small, neatly trimmed bushes. The scene conveys a sense of urban life with its clean, organized environment and steady flow of traffic and pedestrians.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
