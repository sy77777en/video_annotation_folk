    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot filmed from above, a person with a speed wing is initially located in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground above a rocky landscape. A body of water occupies the bottom left foreground and middle ground, with a grassy shore in the bottom right foreground. The middle ground consists of rocky slopes on the left and right, while a large mountain peak is visible in the center-right background. The person glides from the center towards the bottom left of the frame, moving from the middle ground toward the foreground as they fly low over the water's surface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a red long-sleeved top, dark pants, and a backpack is suspended in a harness beneath a large, black and blue speed wing. They are seen gliding low over the ground and a body of water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a scene in a rugged, alpine mountain valley under a clear blue sky. Steep, gray, rocky cliffs and scree slopes surround a calm body of water extending from the foreground to the middleground, whose dark surface reflects the scenery. Patches of coniferous trees and dry, brownish-yellow grasses dot the landscape. A single individual glides with a large, black and blue paragliding wing, flying low over the terrain and nearing the shore by the water's edge. A prominent, flat-topped mountain peak is visible in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
