    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video centers on three low-polygon humanoid figures on a large red cube. A figure on the right, dressed in a dark blue shirt and light-colored pants, sits leaning forward with its elbows on its knees. To its left, another figure in a reddish-brown outfit sits with one elbow raised. Seated behind these two is a translucent, greenish figure. A vast crowd of similar low-polygon, grey-colored humanoid figures stands around the cube, oriented in various directions. The crowd is starkly lit, with the figures on the left illuminated by a bright white light and those on the right bathed in a red glow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, abstract environment, three stylized, low-polygon figures are positioned on a large, red geometric block. A translucent green figure is seated behind two other seated figures, one dressed in blue and white and the other in reddish-brown. The view pulls back and up to reveal that the central block is surrounded by a massive crowd of similar grey, low-polygon figures. The entire assembly is divided by lighting, with a bright white light illuminating the figures on the left and a reddish light cast upon those on the right.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins by showing three humanoid subjects sitting on a red cube, occupying 70% of the frame's height. The camera then pulls back, revealing more humanoid subjects standing around the red cube. Eventually, the entire frame becomes filled with humanoid subjects, with the subjects on the red cube in the center remaining the primary focus.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle medium shot, with three low-polygon figures on a red cube occupying the center of the frame. One figure is on the left side of the cube, another is on the right, and a translucent figure is positioned behind them. The camera then pulls back and moves upward, transitioning into a high-angle wide shot that reveals a massive crowd of similar figures surrounding the central cube. As the camera continues to pull away, the crowd fills the entire frame, with the initial subjects on the cube remaining in the center, now significantly smaller in scale. The crowd is visually divided, with the figures on the left side of the frame illuminated by a bright white light and the figures on the right bathed in a red glow.",
