    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures a skateboarder from a low, rear-facing perspective, positioned in the center foreground. Initially, a curved glass building occupies the left side of the frame, with a dark planter in the center-left foreground and an urban plaza with trees in the background. The skateboarder moves forward from the center foreground into the middle ground, entering a narrow breezeway. As he moves, a textured stone wall with an ATM appears on the right side of the frame, enclosing the space. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, follows him through the breezeway, briefly shifting to a side view as he turns near the exit.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man is shown from a low, rear-facing perspective as he skateboards. He wears a light-colored, short-sleeved t-shirt and dark blue jeans that are cuffed at the bottom, revealing white socks and dark-colored skate shoes. Tattoos are visible on both of his arms. The video concludes with a side view of the man's face, which is captured by the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Shot from a low, wide-angle perspective, the video follows a skateboarder through a modern urban plaza during the day. The ground is paved with large, gray, textured stone tiles. On the left, a building features a large, curved glass wall that reflects trees and other city buildings. The path leads from an open area, past a dark circular planter, into a narrower, covered breezeway. This passage is flanked by the glass wall on one side and a textured gray stone wall on the other, into which an orange and black ATM is recessed. Through the end of the breezeway, more trees and buildings are visible in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
