    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot with no major subjects. The composition is horizontally divided, with a vast sky occupying the top two-thirds of the frame and a flat landscape in the bottom third. In the background, a massive, dark storm cloud formation stretches across the middle of the frame, from which a column of rain descends in the center. Above this dark mass, lighter blue and white clouds fill the top of the frame. The foreground and middle ground consist of a green field with rows that recede from the bottom center toward the distant storm on the horizon. The entire cloud system is in rapid, time-lapsed motion, churning and shifting across the sky. The camera is positioned at a low height relative to the field, looking straight ahead toward the horizon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of an approaching storm rather than a specific main subject. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky, where lighter, wispy blue and white clouds in the upper atmosphere give way to a massive, dark, and ominous storm cloud that stretches across the lower half of the sky. This deep blue-black cloud formation hangs low over the horizon, from which a concentrated column of rain can be seen falling in the distance. Below, a flat expanse of green farmland, marked by faint rows leading toward the storm, meets a horizon glowing with a soft orange light, creating a stark contrast with the dark weather system above. The shot's emphasis is on the powerful environmental display, capturing the feeling of being in the presence of a significant weather event.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a time-lapse sequence over a vast, flat landscape, a massive storm system churns in the sky. A large, dark blue-gray cloud formation dominates the view, hanging low over the horizon, from which a concentrated column of precipitation falls in the distance. Above the dark storm, the sky is a lighter blue with wispy clouds, while a faint orange glow lines the horizon. The foreground, extending into the background, features a dark green field with clearly visible rows stretching toward the distant weather event. The clouds are in constant, rapid motion, evolving and shifting across the expanse.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
