    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an older man with short gray hair and glasses, wearing a maroon shirt with a yellow accent on the pocket. He is seated at a table, holding chopsticks in his right hand, poised to eat from a plate of noodles garnished with vegetables. In front of him, there is a glass of iced tea. On his right, partially visible, is another individual wearing a yellow garment with a subtle pattern. The setting appears to be a restaurant with a warm, ambient light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a dimly lit restaurant with a warm, intimate atmosphere. The setting features a table with a white tablecloth, where a plate of noodles and a glass of iced tea are prominently placed. In the background, additional tables with white tablecloths enhance the restaurant\u2019s warm ambiance, while red-cushioned chairs and ornate ceiling details add to its classic, cozy charm. The lighting is soft, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the rich colors of the food and surroundings. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining a focus on the dining experience within this inviting environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of the older man, capturing him from the waist up. He is centrally positioned in the frame, seated at a table in the foreground. His right hand holds chopsticks, directed towards a plate of noodles located in the bottom center of the frame. A glass of iced tea sits to the right of the plate, also in the foreground. To the left side of the frame, partially visible, is another individual wearing a yellow garment, situated slightly behind the main subject in the middle ground. The background includes additional tables with white tablecloths and red-cushioned chairs, arranged symmetrically along the walls. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's eye level, ensuring the older man remains the focal point throughout the scene. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the elements within the frame.",
