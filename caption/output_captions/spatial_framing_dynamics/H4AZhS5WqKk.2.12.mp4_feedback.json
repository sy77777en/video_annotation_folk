    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of the blue-gray cartoon cat, whose head is replaced by a shiny metal iron, positioned centrally and occupying the middle ground. The cat\u2019s body is upright, with its large pink ears extending to the left and right, and the iron\u2019s cord hanging downward. The cat stands at the same height as the camera, which is level with its torso and face. Behind the cat, the softly lit bedroom is visible, with the bed and lamp to the left in the background and a large window with city lights to the right. As the scene progresses, the cat\u2019s body moves quickly toward the left, causing its torso and ears to sweep across the center and left side, while the iron remains prominent until it exits the view. The background elements, including the bed, lamp, and window, remain stationary in the background, maintaining their positions relative to the cat\u2019s movement. Throughout, the camera maintains a consistent height and distance, keeping the action at eye level and the cat\u2019s movement clearly visible within the room\u2019s spatial context.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an animated blue-gray anthropomorphic cat with large pink inner ears, a white muzzle, and a light blue belly. The cat's head is pressed by a shiny metal electric iron, flattening its features. The iron's cord hangs down, and the iron's faceplate is oriented forward, pressing against the cat's face. The cat's large ears protrude from the sides, and its whiskers, slightly singed, curl stiffly from the heat. As the iron moves away, the cat's face is imprinted with the shape of the iron, leaving its expression frozen in shock. The cat's appearance is distinctly cartoonish, with exaggerated proportions and smooth, simplified textures, while the iron is rendered with realistic metallic reflections and details, creating a striking contrast between the animated body and the realistic object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a softly lit bedroom at night, with a large window revealing a dark sky and city lights in the distance. The room features a bed with white linens, a beige padded headboard, and a wooden nightstand topped with a rectangular lamp that emits a warm glow. The walls are light-colored, and the window is framed by long, neutral curtains. A blue animated character with pink ears and a light blue belly is present, with a shiny metal iron covering its face; the iron is silver with black and red details, a visible cord, and a reflective surface. The character\u2019s placement and movement are consistent with the room\u2019s layout, and the scene maintains a clear distinction between the animated figure and the realistic environment.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
