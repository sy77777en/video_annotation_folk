    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a rapid pan across a roadside embankment before the camera settles on a view from behind a cyclist on a paved road. The cyclist, wearing a white short-sleeved jersey with dark side panels, black shorts, and a white helmet, rides away from the camera down the center of the road. A graphic overlay is present at the top of the screen, consisting of a dark blue banner with white and black text. This overlay is divided into sections labeled \"LEADERS,\" \"CHASE,\" and \"GC PELOTON,\" and also displays race information, including \"STAGE 1\" and the distance remaining in the race.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, the scene captures a daytime road race on a two-lane asphalt road marked with a central yellow line and a white shoulder line. The road is bordered by dense forest on both sides, forming a tree-lined path. The camera moves rapidly along the road, showing multiple cyclists racing along the center of the lane. A blue and black graphic overlay is present at the top of the screen, displaying \"TOUR OF UTAH\" and \"STAGE 1 CEDAR CITY\" on the left, along with the distance remaining. The center and right of the overlay provide race statistics for the \"LEADERS,\" \"CHASE,\" and \"PELOTON\" groups, including the number of riders and their time gaps.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a rapid rightward pan across a roadside embankment in the middle ground, with a static graphic overlay positioned at the top of the frame. The pan settles to reveal a wide shot of a cyclist in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a paved road. The road stretches from the foreground at the bottom towards the background, with trees lining both sides in the middle and background. The camera follows the cyclist from behind as they ride away, keeping them centered while they move further into the background.",
