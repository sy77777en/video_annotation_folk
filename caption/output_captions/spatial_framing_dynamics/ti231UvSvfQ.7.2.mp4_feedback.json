    "pre_caption": "This is a medium shot with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. In the foreground on the left, an elderly man lies in a bed. In the middle ground on the right, a young man is seated, holding a folder. A white desk lamp is positioned in the middle ground to the left, above the bed, while an orange container sits on a table to the far left.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with short blond hair sits, looking down with a wide-eyed, open-mouthed expression. He is wearing a dark blue sweatshirt over a white t-shirt and holds an open blue folder in his hands. Initially, he looks toward the lower right at the folder, then turns his head to look toward the bottom left at the elderly man. In the foreground, an elderly, light-skinned man with wrinkled skin and thinning hair lies on his back in a bed, covered by a white sheet. His head rests on a pillow, his eyes are closed, and his eyelids are twitching.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This scene takes place in a dimly lit, sterile-looking room with plain, light-gray walls. An elderly person is lying in a bed with white sheets, positioned on the left side of the scene. A white, articulated desk lamp is on the table, but it is turned off. To the right, a young man in a blue sweatshirt is seated, holding an open blue folder. In the background, a door is visible, and a green sign is located on the wall. Next to the bed, a small table holds an orange sharps container. The overall color palette is cool and desaturated, consisting mainly of grays and blues.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
