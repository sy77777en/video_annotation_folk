    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two stylized, low-polygon humanoid figures seated on high chairs on a central, illuminated stage, facing each other across a stand that supports two small screens. The figure on the left wears a red and dark-colored top with light-colored pants, while the figure on the right is clad in a light-colored, possibly grey or silver, outfit; both exhibit a somewhat reflective sheen and have featureless heads, with their hands resting on their laps. In the foreground, silhouettes of several audience members are visible from the shoulders up, observing the stage. Further back, more stylized, dark, low-polygon humanoid figures are seated on tiered bleachers, also facing the stage.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, on a dimly lit stage with a dark floor marked by glowing orange lines radiating from the center. Two low-poly, metallic-looking figures are seated on high, modern chairs, facing each other across a sleek, metallic central console. Behind them, two large staircases are illuminated with a warm orange glow. Silhouetted figures, representing an audience, are visible in the foreground and in the background on either side of the stage, observing the central scene which is highlighted by spotlights. The overall aesthetic is futuristic and minimalist, dominated by dark tones contrasted with the bright orange lighting and metallic sheens.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video depicts a television studio setting, focusing on two humanoid subjects seated face-to-face on a central stage. Initially, the camera is positioned within the audience, showing only the lower body of a humanoid subject in the upper part of the frame. The camera then moves upward, revealing the two humanoid subjects on stage and part of the studio surroundings.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins from an audience perspective, initially showing only the lower body of a central humanoid figure in the upper frame and middle ground. The camera then moves upward, transitioning to a medium shot that reveals two stylized humanoid figures seated in the middle ground: one center-left, the other center-right, across a central console also in the middle ground and center frame. Foreground silhouettes of audience members are at the bottom of the frame. In the background, additional audience silhouettes are on tiered bleachers to the left and right, with two large, orange-illuminated staircases flanking the central scene, one on each side. Glowing orange lines radiate from the center of the stage floor in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the level of the two central subjects on stage.",
