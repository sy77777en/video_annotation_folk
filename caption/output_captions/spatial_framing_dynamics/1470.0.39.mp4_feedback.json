    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of the subject, who is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground. The subject is initially facing away from the camera, with their back towards the viewer. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium close-up, bringing the subject closer to the camera while maintaining their central position. The subject turns around, revealing their face and upper body more prominently. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, capturing their movements smoothly. In the background, the room's elements such as the yellow-framed window, sheer curtains, and green basket with patterned towels remain consistently placed in the middle ground, providing context without shifting positions. The transition between shots focuses on the subject's movement from facing away to turning towards the camera, emphasizing their presence in the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person with short, slightly wavy brown hair, wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and a dark striped tie. Their gender is not easily determined. They are holding a book with a dark cover. The person has a light skin tone and a pronounced smile, with a slightly tilted head. The setting suggests an indoor environment with yellow doors. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The room features light-colored walls and a window with sheer curtains that allow soft, natural light to filter in, creating a gentle glow. The window is framed by a yellow border, adding a touch of color to the space. An inconspicuous green basket containing towels with pink and white patterns is visible, suggesting a cozy, lived-in environment. The overall scene is calm and well-lit, with a focus on the interior's simple yet welcoming decor.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
