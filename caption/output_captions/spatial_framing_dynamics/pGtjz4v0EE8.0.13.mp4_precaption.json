    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a high-angle, extreme wide perspective, a large crowd of people populates a waterside plaza. The individuals are indistinct but are collectively seen wearing a variety of colorful casual attire in shades of red, blue, green, and white. Along the waterfront, numerous long, slender, blue gondolas are docked side-by-side. A single black gondola carrying several people moves across the water. A figure, the gondolier, stands at the stern, propelling the boat forward, while a few passengers are seated in the main body of the vessel.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An elevated, observational shot captures a bustling daytime scene at St. Mark's Basin in Venice. On the right, the distinctive Doge's Palace features an orange and white diamond-patterned upper level above a white stone loggia with Gothic arches. To the left of the Doge's Palace, two tall columns, each topped with a statue, stand amidst a large crowd of people on the stone-paved waterfront. The foreground is dominated by the dark teal water of the lagoon, where numerous blue gondolas are moored along wooden docks. A single gondola with passengers glides across the water.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera begins with an extreme wide shot of a crowded area. A boat then enters the frame from the bottom right, and the camera begins to track it. Overall, the scene remains an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no clear subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is above the subject, and the camera height remains unchanged.",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, extreme wide shot, the scene captures a bustling waterside plaza. The Doge's Palace occupies the top right and center of the frame in the middle ground, with a large crowd of people filling the plaza to its left. In the middle ground on the left, two tall columns stand amidst the crowd. The foreground is dominated by the water of the lagoon, while a line of docked gondolas stretches across the bottom of the frame in the middle ground. A single black gondola enters from the right side of the frame and moves leftward across the foreground water. The camera, remaining in its elevated position, subtly pans to the left to follow the gondola's path.",
