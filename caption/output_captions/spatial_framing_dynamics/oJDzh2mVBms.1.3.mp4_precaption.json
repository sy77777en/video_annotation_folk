    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases the Aurora Borealis, a natural light display filling a dark night sky. The phenomenon manifests as large, ethereal curtains and ribbons of vibrant green light that swirl and shift in fluid, amorphous shapes. The intensity of the green color varies, ranging from bright, luminous sections to more subdued, darker green areas. The focus remains on the mesmerizing movement and color of the aurora, without any visible stars in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A view of the night sky is filled with the dynamic display of the aurora borealis. Vibrant, glowing green lights swirl and dance across the dark expanse, shifting in shape and intensity. The lights form fluid, curtain-like patterns against a backdrop of a clear, dark sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a low-angle view of the night sky, which serves as the background. Initially, a large, soft formation of green light occupies the bottom left and central portions of the frame, extending diagonally toward the top right. As the video progresses, the light patterns become more dynamic and intense. A bright, concentrated ribbon of green light moves from the left side of the frame, sweeping across the center and then shifting upwards. The amorphous shapes of light continuously swirl and change, expanding and contracting to fill different areas of the frame against the dark sky.",
