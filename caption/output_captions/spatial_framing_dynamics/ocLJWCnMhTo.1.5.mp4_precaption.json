    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a person wearing dark pants and a long-sleeved dark top, pouring water from a bright red, rectangular plastic bucket. Initially, only the upper half of the person is visible, with their arm extended downward holding the bucket. As the video progresses, most of the person\u2019s body moves out of view, leaving only their arm and hand, which continue to grip and tilt the bucket. The water flows out in a steady stream, creating a distinct trail in the air. On the right side, another person in dark clothing appears to be holding a piece of plastic film, while a third individual in dark clothing is seated on the stairs between them. The focus remains on the action of pouring, with the red bucket and the water trail as the main subjects throughout the sequence.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a static scene indoors, featuring a room with primarily off-white walls and ceiling. Purple patches adorn the left wall, while green patches are on the right, accompanied by red banners above them. Yellow patches are visible on the lower side of the central staircase, with another red banner above it. A person is caught in the act of pouring water from a bright red, rectangular plastic bucket, with the water stream appearing suspended in mid-air. The floor is covered with clear plastic sheeting, one end of which is held by the person on the right. Vertical metal poles, possibly part of a structure or scaffolding, are present in the foreground, and the scene is framed by a thin black border.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person pouring water from a red bucket. At first, only half of the person\u2019s body is visible in the upper-left corner, while the bucket is fully visible. As the camera cranes up, most of the person\u2019s body moves out of the frame, leaving only the arm and the bucket visible at the end.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot showing the upper half of a person in the upper-left corner of the frame, holding a bright red bucket that is fully visible near the center-left. The camera is initially positioned below the subject, looking upward. As the person pours water, their arm extends downward, and the water stream flows diagonally from the center-left toward the lower center of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground. As the camera cranes up, most of the person\u2019s body moves out of view, leaving only their arm and the bucket in the upper-left and center-left, now at the same height as the camera. On the right side, another person stands in the middle ground, holding a piece of plastic film that stretches from the right edge toward the center, while a third person is seated on the stairs in the background, near the center-right. The floor, covered with clear plastic sheeting, occupies the lower part of the frame in the foreground. Vertical metal poles are present in the foreground, running from the bottom to the top of the frame. The background consists of off-white walls with colored patches and banners, and a staircase is visible in the center. The spatial focus remains on the red bucket and the water stream, with the camera movement shifting the viewer\u2019s perspective from below the subject to eye level as the action unfolds.",
