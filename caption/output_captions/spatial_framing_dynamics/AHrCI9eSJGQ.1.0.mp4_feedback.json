    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle perspective on the deck of a container ship. A large yellow gantry crane occupies the foreground and middle ground, spanning the top half of the frame. In the foreground at the bottom, stacks of shipping containers are arranged across the ship's deck. The background consists of the sea with other vessels in the distance on the left and center, while more of the port, including additional cranes and containers, is visible on the right.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an industrial maritime scenery shot taken from the deck of a massive container ship docked in a busy port. The perspective is a dramatic low-angle view looking up at a series of enormous yellow gantry cranes that loom directly overhead, their structural beams and cables filling the upper portion of the scene against a partly cloudy sky. These cranes extend into the distance along the line of shipping containers. Below the cranes, the ship's deck is laden with stacks of red, blue, and grey shipping containers, stretching into the distance where the calm sea and other vessels are visible. The shot lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to capture the immense scale and overwhelming atmosphere of the industrial environment, emphasizing the grandeur of the machinery and the vastness of the cargo operations.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From the deck of a container ship at a bustling industrial port, a massive yellow gantry crane looms directly overhead, its structural arm and cables dominating the view. The ship's deck is laden with stacks of red and blue rectangular shipping containers. In the background, a body of water stretches out, with other ships visible in the distance. To the right, the port's landscape continues with more cranes and stacked containers under a partly cloudy sky. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays white text that reads, \"Cargo Operations will take about 13 hours. During this time some crew will go ashore, some will work, some will rest.\" A red and white \"Tube JEFFHK\" watermark is located in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
