    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a cityscape scenery shot, capturing an urban street scene with a focus on architectural elements and the blend of modern and traditional styles. The environment features colorful storefronts and bright signage, but the street is less crowded, with fewer people engaging in daily activities. The atmosphere is more relaxed and serene, offering a quieter perspective of the city.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, capturing a bustling urban street scene in a vibrant city setting. The environment is outdoors, featuring a standard-width street similar to a one-way lane, lined with colorful storefronts and bright signage. The time of day could be interpreted as either early morning or late afternoon, with natural light illuminating the scene. Notable visual elements include a variety of shopfronts with vivid, multicolored signs and displays, highlighted by typical colored yellow lights. The street is paved and relatively clean, with a few pedestrians casually walking along the sidewalk. The architecture is modern, with a mix of glass and metal materials. A few bicycles are parked along the street, and small potted plants add a touch of greenery. The overall atmosphere is lively and dynamic, reflecting the energy of a busy urban area.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of an urban street scene, showcasing a full view of the street and surrounding storefronts. The camera remains stationary throughout the sequence, maintaining a consistent perspective. In the 2D frame, the street stretches from the bottom center towards the top center, creating a vanishing point effect. Storefronts line both sides of the street; those on the left occupy the left side of the frame, while those on the right fill the right side. In 3D space, the storefronts are situated in the foreground and middle ground, with some buildings extending into the background. The camera is positioned at a height roughly level with the storefronts, providing a direct view of the street and its surroundings. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the video, maintaining a steady and comprehensive view of the urban environment.",
