    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two motorcyclists are seen racing on a track at high speed, making it challenging to distinguish their clothing. One rider is ahead of the other as both maintain a forward-leaning racing posture on their respective motorcycles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a fast-moving, blurry view of two vehicles on a paved road before pulling back to reveal a wider, high-angle perspective. The scene is set in a vast desert landscape under a clear, light blue sky. A dark asphalt racetrack curves through the beige, sandy terrain, which is marked with tire tracks alongside the road. In the distance, a range of brown, rocky mountains lines the horizon. Two vehicles are visible driving along the track in this expansive, arid environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a fast-moving, blurry, high-angle shot of a motorcycle in the top left of the frame, with its shadow dominating the center. The camera then rapidly pulls back and up, transitioning into a high-angle extreme wide shot that reveals the full scene. In the final composition, the two motorcyclists are small figures in the middle ground, positioned on the left side of the frame as they travel along a racetrack. The track curves from the bottom left through the middle ground, surrounded by sandy desert in the foreground and on the left. A mountain range and a clear sky occupy the background at the top of the frame.",
