    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an indoor urban setting, capturing a long, covered walkway with a sleek, contemporary design. The camera remains at eye level throughout, providing a consistent perspective of the environment. Initially, the walkway stretches into the background, with the ceiling's exposed beams and smooth flooring dominating the upper and lower portions of the frame. On the right side, large windows or glass walls reveal well-lit interiors, likely shops or restaurants, situated in the middle ground. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward, bringing a blue fabric banner with white text into clearer view on the right side, hanging near the center-right of the frame. This banner is positioned in the foreground, accompanied by a digital display board showing images, suggesting a restaurant entrance. To the left, decorative elements like potted plants and wooden benches are placed along the walkway, adding greenery and warmth to the scene. An escalator is visible further back on the left side, enhancing the modern feel of the space. The camera's movement is smooth, maintaining a steady pace as it transitions from the initial wide view of the walkway to a closer focus on the banner and display board. The watermark \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV\" remains consistently in the lower left corner,",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an urban scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere of the indoor space, highlighting architectural elements and ambient lighting rather than a specific object or subject. The composition emphasizes the overall setting and mood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a first-person POV, takes place in an indoor setting resembling a modern shopping or dining area. The environment features a long, covered walkway with a sleek, contemporary design. The ceiling is lined with exposed beams, and the floor is smooth and clean. On one side, there are large windows or glass walls, allowing a view into well-lit interiors, possibly shops or restaurants. Decorative elements like potted plants and wooden benches are placed along the walkway, adding a touch of greenery and warmth. The scene includes an escalator, enhancing the modern feel of the space. Notable visual elements include a blue fabric banner with white text and a digital display board showing images, suggesting a restaurant entrance. Overlay elements, such as a watermark reading \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV,\" are present in the lower corner, indicating the video\u2019s source.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
