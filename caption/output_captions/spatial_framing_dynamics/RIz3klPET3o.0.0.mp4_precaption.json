    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, stylized figure with a white, conical hat, a white torso, and black legs rides a simple, hand-drawn bicycle. A scarf-like object trails behind the figure, featuring blue, white, green, and red colors. The path for the bicycle is a single, undulating black line that is part of a musical score. This score begins with a grand staff, showing a treble clef and a bass clef. Other hand-drawn musical symbols are visible in the scene, including a fermata, a pianissimo (pp) marking, and an eighth rest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video, the scene is set against a plain white background, styled as a hand-drawn musical score. On the left, a grand staff with a treble and bass clef is depicted. Extending from the staff, a long, undulating black line serves as a path for a small, cartoonish figure riding a bicycle. The camera pans from left to right, following the character's movement. Above the path, other musical symbols like a fermata and a 'pp' dynamic marking are visible, with more notations appearing as the scene progresses.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot with a grand staff positioned on the left side of the frame in the middle ground. A small, stylized figure on a bicycle starts in the center-left, riding on a black line that extends from the staff. Above the figure, a fermata and a pianissimo marking are visible in the top-center of the frame. The camera, positioned at the subject's height, pans from left to right, following the figure as it travels along the undulating line across the middle ground. As the camera moves, the initial staff exits the frame, and new musical notations appear in the bottom right.",
