    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a classroom, a white man with graying hair, wearing a dark suit, white shirt, and red tie, sits in a chair holding an open book. To his right, a Black woman with short dark hair and glasses sits in a red office chair, facing a group of children. In front of her is a large, light-purple easel. The children, who appear to be elementary school-aged and are mostly Black, are seated in chairs facing the two adults. They are wearing white shirts, and many have their hands raised. A girl in the foreground with braided hair and a white shirt has her hand up. In the background, five adults stand against the wall: three white men in dark suits, one Black man in a dark green suit, and one Black woman wearing a black blazer over a red shirt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a brightly lit elementary school classroom with white cinder block walls. The back wall is decorated with educational materials, including a number line, charts, and a poster of the White House. On the right, a dark bulletin board is covered with various papers and artwork. A group of children, mostly wearing white shirts, are seated in chairs facing the front, with many raising their hands. At the front of the room, a man in a dark suit and a woman in a purple top are seated in chairs, with a small easel positioned in front of the woman. In the background, near a doorway, several adults in business attire are standing and observing the class. The floor is covered in dark carpeting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot captures a classroom scene from a perspective at the subjects' level. In the foreground and extending into the middle ground, a group of children is seated in chairs, occupying the left and central portions of the frame, with one girl prominently positioned in the bottom-left foreground. In the middle ground, a man sits in a chair slightly to the right of center, and a woman is seated in an office chair on the right side of the frame. An easel is also in the middle ground, positioned in front of the woman on the right. Five adults stand in the background against the back wall, arranged from the center to the left side of the frame. The background also features posters on the back wall and a bulletin board on the right wall.",
