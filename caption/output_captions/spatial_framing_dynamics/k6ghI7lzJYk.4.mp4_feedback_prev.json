    "pre_caption": "In this wide shot, filmed from a slightly elevated perspective, a white goat stands in the center-left of the frame in the middle ground, positioned on a black metal ramp with its back to the camera. To its right, a brown goat is in the middle ground, walking from the right side of the frame toward the center. The ramp extends from the bottom-left foreground into the middle ground. A wooden shelving unit is positioned in the center-right middle ground, while a large wooden box occupies the left middle ground. The entire scene is enclosed by a fence visible on the right and in the background, with trees and a yard in the distant background. As the video progresses, the camera pans slightly to the left, bringing more of the wooden box on the left into view while the brown goat continues its movement toward the center.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In an outdoor enclosure, two goats are visible. One goat, which is predominantly white with some black markings on its rear and tail, stands on a black metal ramp with its back to the camera. To its right, a smaller goat with brown and white fur stands on the concrete ground, appearing to be pregnant.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place during the day within an outdoor, fenced enclosure that has a concrete floor. Outside the right edge of the fence, dry, yellow leaves are scattered, enhancing the natural ambiance of the scene. In the background, beyond a chain-link fence, trees and a yard with playground equipment are visible. The enclosure contains a black, mesh-metal milking stand where a white goat is positioned. To the right of the stand is a wooden shelving unit with black fabric bins and a silver metal canister. A small wooden stool and a larger, light-colored wooden storage box are also present. A smaller brown and white goat walks on the concrete floor near the stand as the camera pans slightly to the left.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
