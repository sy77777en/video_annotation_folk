    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man in a black suit with a white dress shirt, who is the main subject. He appears to be in his 30s, with short dark hair, jumping up with a focused expression. The video captures him with arms raised, emphasizing the dynamic movement. In the background, there are two other men; one is partially visible, wearing a light-colored jacket, and appears to be turning away from the action, while the other is bent over a table, possibly reacting to the commotion. Additionally, a man in red is visible, though he is not a significant character. The scene conveys a sense of urgency and dramatic action centered around the main subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting within an elegant restaurant featuring large glass partitions. The environment is characterized by classic decor, including dark green curtains, wooden elements, and classical-style chandeliers. White tablecloths adorn the dining tables. The scene captures a moment of dynamic motion as a person in formal attire jumps up, coinciding with a large amount of water rushing into the restaurant. The lighting is artificial, illuminating the interior. Overlay elements include a watermark in the bottom left corner, labeled \"MOVIECLIPS,\" which is not part of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium full shot of the main subject, a man in a black suit, positioned centrally in the foreground. He is captured mid-jump with arms raised, dominating the frame. Two other men are in the background; one in a light-colored jacket is on the right side, slightly turned away, while another is bent over a table on the left. A man in red is also visible further back on the right. The scene shifts to a medium shot as the main subject continues his jump, moving closer to the camera. The background remains consistent, showing an elegant restaurant with large glass partitions, dark green curtains, and white tablecloths. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subject throughout, capturing the dynamic motion and the rush of water entering the room. The transition from medium full to medium shot emphasizes the subject's movement towards the camera, enhancing the sense of urgency and action.",
