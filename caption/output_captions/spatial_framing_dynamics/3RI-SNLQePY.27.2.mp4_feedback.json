    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a dimly lit, monochromatic interior with a man positioned on the left side, walking towards the center. He is dressed in a white shirt with black pants, has a medium build, and short hair. The setting includes a reception desk, a coat rack, and several chandeliers, creating a vintage atmosphere. Red dots on the ground suggest the presence of blood. The text \"The elevator is out of order\" and \"The phone is ringing\" appears in the bottom right corner, adding a narrative element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a large, dimly lit hall with a monochromatic black-and-white color scheme. The space features a checkered floor, a large reception desk on the left, and a grand staircase in the background. Illumination comes from several ornate chandeliers with lit candles hanging from the high ceiling, as well as two circular wall lamps positioned on either side of the archway in front of the staircase. The checkered floor is marked with red, footprint-like splotches and faint white geometric outlines. A figure dressed in black and white walks across the room, followed by a moving light source that creates a relatively illuminated area around him. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays white text that changes from \"The elevator is out of order\" to \"The phone is ringing,\" which is then followed by a telephone icon.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
