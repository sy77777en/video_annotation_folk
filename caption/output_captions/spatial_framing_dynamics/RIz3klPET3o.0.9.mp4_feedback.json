    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of the scene, captured from a side-view perspective at the subject's height. Initially, a small, abstract figure on a sled is in the middle ground on the right, situated on a long, curved black line. In the top left, the number \"38\" and the notation \"mp\" are also visible in the middle ground. As the figure travels from right to left along the line, the camera pans to follow it, causing the text elements on the left to move out of the frame. Concurrently, several short, dashed lines appear in the middle ground to the left of the figure, while the text \"/40\" materializes in the bottom left foreground. By the end of the clip, the figure is positioned on the center-left, with the track continuing off-screen and a large, C-shaped curve now occupying the right side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features a minimalist, hand-drawn scene with a small, abstract figure on a sled as the central subject. The figure is composed of a white, blocky body and a white conical hat. It sits on a simple gray sled with two runners. The scene also contains various hand-drawn black elements, including a long, curved line upon which the sled is positioned, several short dashed lines, the number \"38,\" the musical notation \"mp,\" and the text \"40.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, is set against a plain, light gray background. The environment is minimalist, featuring a hand-drawn, continuous black line that forms a track with curves. A small, cartoonish figure on a sled-like vehicle travels along this track. Black, hand-drawn text and numbers, including \"38,\" \"mp,\" and \"40,\" are visible on the screen, resembling a game interface.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
