    "pre_caption": "The scene is presented in a static wide shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. In the middle ground, a man sits in a chair on the left side of the frame, facing a woman seated on a sofa on the right. A coffee table is placed in the middle ground between them. Two out-of-focus cameras on tripods occupy the foreground, one on the far left and the other on the far right, framing the central scene. In the background, two studio lights are positioned behind the subjects, a large painting hangs on the right wall, and a desk is visible on the far left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man and a woman in a modern, well-lit room. The man, with short gray hair, is wearing a light gray suit and is seated on a brown chair, facing the woman. The woman, with long dark hair, is dressed in a gray top and pink pants, sitting on a brown leather sofa. Both are engaged in conversation, with the man leaning slightly forward. Studio lights are positioned in the background behind them, illuminating the scene. A small round table with a book on it is placed between the man and the woman. Two cameras on tripods are set up in the foreground and appear out of focus, suggesting a recorded interview or discussion. A modern blue and red painting is on the right side of the wall, and a black and white architectural sketch is visible in the background on the left side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an indoor setting, resembling a modern interview or filming studio. The room features light grey paneled walls. On the left, part of a white desk is visible. In the center, a man in a grey suit sits in a brown leather chair, facing a woman in a grey top and pink trousers seated on a brown leather sofa. Between them is a low, round, dark grey coffee table with a book on it. Two large studio lights on tripods illuminate the subjects. Two video cameras on tripods are positioned to film the interaction, one aimed more towards the man and the other towards the woman. A large, colorful abstract painting hangs on the wall behind the sofa. An overlay text appears at the bottom left corner, reading \"Financial Post - London's 'Fysocraper' owners to spend millions of pounds to block building's car melting 'solar death-ray' (2014).\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
