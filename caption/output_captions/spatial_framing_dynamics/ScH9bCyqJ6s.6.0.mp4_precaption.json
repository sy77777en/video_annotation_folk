    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person's light-skinned fingers hold a small, rectangular electronic component. The component consists of a black plastic frame with a silver-colored, brushed metal plate on top. Set into this plate is a small, recessed, rounded-square window with a black border. Inside this window are dozens of tiny, bright blue spheres, tightly packed together.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video focuses closely on a small, metallic electronic component with a rectangular shape and rounded edges. The component features a shiny silver surface with a smooth texture, interrupted by a small, glass-covered window displaying a blue, patterned detail inside. The surrounding area includes a matte black material with a slightly rough texture, likely part of the device\u2019s casing. Human fingers are visible, holding the component gently, with natural skin tones and fine lines apparent. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the metallic sheen and the blue detail within the window. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video uses an extreme close-up shot, filling the frame with a small, rectangular electronic component and the fingers holding it. The component is positioned in the center of the frame and occupies the middle ground, while the fingers are visible along the left and top edges, also in the middle ground. The background is out of focus and consists of a neutral surface, occupying the background layer. The camera is positioned above the subjects, looking down at a slight angle, with the component\u2019s metallic surface and the blue-detailed window clearly visible. There is no significant movement or change in shot size between the frames; the spatial arrangement remains stable, with the component and fingers maintaining their positions relative to the frame and each other.",
