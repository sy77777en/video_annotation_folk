    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a camouflage-patterned long-sleeved shirt and matching pants sits on the ground, looking down. They wear a beanie with a blue design and yellow geometric highlights. To the right, another person with long, dark hair, wearing blue jeans, is seen from behind as they walk away. A third individual is visible in the shadows on the left side of the frame, walking out of the shot to the left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a wooded area at dusk, characterized by cool, low lighting. A dense forest with tall, slender trees, many with bare branches, forms the background against a pale blue sky. The ground is a mixture of green grass, weeds, and scattered brown leaves. In the center of the clearing, a person wearing camouflage clothing sits on a small, grassy incline. To the right, another individual is partially visible, walking away into the woods. To the left of the person sitting, a third individual is walking out of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a person in camouflage sits stationary in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a grassy incline. To the right, another person is visible in the middle ground, walking away from the camera toward the right edge of the frame. On the far left, a third individual in the middle ground walks out of the shot to the left. The foreground is composed of out-of-focus grass at the bottom of the frame, with a dense forest in the background. The camera is positioned at the level of the seated subject.",
