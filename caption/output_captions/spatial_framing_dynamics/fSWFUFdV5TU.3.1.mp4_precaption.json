    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nPlease not to mention the first or the last frame as much as possible.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures the interior scenery of a dimly lit room, focusing on the overall atmosphere and environment rather than a specific subject. The composition features a dark wooden door with a sliver of light visible through its crack, flanked by a wall with a light switch, a framed picture, and a side table holding a lamp, a framed photo, and a bowl. To the right of the door, a larger framed artwork hangs on the wall. The camera dynamically zooms out to include the table and lamp on the left, as well as a potted plant in the lower right corner, enhancing the mood and sense of place, with the setting itself as the primary point of interest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor scene focused on a closed, dark wooden door featuring a silver doorknob and a peephole, with light seeping around its edges from another area. The surrounding walls are light-colored. To the left of the door, a double light switch is visible, alongside a dark wooden side table displaying a red patterned object, a small framed photo, and a green bowl, positioned beneath a framed black-and-white picture. On the right wall hangs a larger, vertically oriented framed artwork containing a predominantly red and dark pattern. In the lower right corner, part of a shoe rack can be seen. The overall lighting is dim, making it difficult to determine whether it is daytime or nighttime. As the view subtly zooms out, a potted plant becomes visible in the lower right corner, and the items on the table are gradually included in the frame as the camera moves.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a dark wooden door, positioned centrally in the frame, with light seeping through its edges. The door is in the middle ground, with the surrounding walls in the background. As the camera zooms out, the shot transitions to a wide shot, revealing more of the room's interior. On the left, a side table with a lamp, a framed photo, and a bowl becomes visible, positioned in the foreground. Above the table, a framed picture is mounted on the wall in the background. To the right of the door, a larger framed artwork is visible on the wall, also in the background. In the lower right corner, a potted plant appears in the foreground. The camera is positioned at a height level with the door, maintaining a straight-on view throughout the zoom-out transition.",
