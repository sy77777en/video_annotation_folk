    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video simulates a satellite camera view of a coastal city, starting with an extreme wide shot that gradually reveals a broader landscape. Two key locations are marked: The Colony Beach & Tennis Resort and Emma E. Booker Elementary School. An orange line highlights a route connecting these two places, traversing the cityscape. A blue dot moves along the orange line, representing someone traveling along the highlighted route. The scene focuses on the geographical layout, with the path prominently displayed, emphasizing the connection between the marked locations.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases a digitally rendered nightscape of a coastal city and its surrounding turquoise waters, resembling satellite imagery. It begins with a focus on a section of an island, gradually expanding to reveal a panoramic view of the coastal island and its dense urban grid. Two prominent turquoise location markers are visible: \"The Colony Beach & Tennis Resort\" on the left, positioned on a narrow strip of land near the ocean, and \"Emma E. Booker Elementary School\" on the right, nestled within the urban grid. An orange illuminated route overlays the terrain, winding across bridges and through the city to connect these two points. A blue illuminated rectangle moves along the route, enhancing the visual representation of the path as the perspective slowly zooms out to reveal the full extent of the connection.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video simulates a satellite camera view, showcasing a coastal city. It begins with an extreme wide shot, and as the camera pulls back, it reveals a broader landscape. The scene appears to show two key locations marked: The Colony Beach & Tennis Resort and Emma E. Booker Elementary School. The path between these two places is highlighted with an orange line, indicating a route across the city. ",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle satellite perspective, the video begins with an extreme wide shot focused on a coastal area. In the top-left, a turquoise marker for \"The Colony Beach & Tennis Resort\" is visible, with the resort itself located in the center-left. An illuminated orange line, representing a route, originates from this point and extends towards the bottom right, with a glowing blue rectangle positioned near the start of the path. As the camera slowly zooms out and pans slightly right, the view expands to reveal a larger geographical area. A second turquoise marker for \"Emma E. Booker Elementary School\" appears in the top-right, situated on the mainland. The full orange route becomes visible, connecting the resort on the left island to the school on the right mainland. The final framing shows the island in the left and middle ground and the mainland in the right and middle ground, all set against a dark water background, establishing the complete spatial relationship between the two marked locations.",
