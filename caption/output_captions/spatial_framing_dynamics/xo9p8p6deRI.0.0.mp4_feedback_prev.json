    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of numerous abstract, monochromatic human figures scattered across the scene. Initially, the camera is positioned at the subjects' level, capturing the figures from a frontal perspective. The figures occupy various positions within the frame: some stand in the foreground on the left and right sides, while others are situated in the middle ground and background, creating depth. A few figures near the center appear to interact with camera equipment on tripods, located slightly off-center in the middle ground. The figures are evenly distributed, with no single subject dominating the frame. As the video progresses, the camera gradually shifts to a higher position, offering a bird's-eye view. This transition reveals more of the dark surface beneath the figures and emphasizes the organized arrangement of the crowd. The barriers and tripod remain consistently placed in the middle and background throughout the sequence, maintaining the scene's structured layout. The camera's movement from eye-level to an elevated angle alters the spatial dynamics, enhancing the viewer's understanding of the scene's scale and organization.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of abstract, monochromatic human figures, all uniformly colored in a light shade, resembling sculptures or mannequins. These figures are positioned in various poses, some standing and others appearing to interact with each other. Among them, a few are engaged with equipment resembling cameras on tripods, suggesting a scene of observation or documentation. The figures are distributed across the scene, creating a sense of a gathering or event, with no single figure standing out as the focal point. The overall composition conveys a sense of uniformity and anonymity among the subjects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting with a crowd of abstract, monochromatic figures gathered in an open area. The figures are uniformly white and lack detailed features, giving them a sculptural appearance. They are positioned on a dark surface, possibly asphalt, which contrasts with their pale color. The environment is defined by a series of barriers and a camera on a tripod, suggesting an organized event or gathering. The background is dark, with minimal architectural elements visible, creating a stark and focused atmosphere. The scene is static, with no visible weather conditions or time of day indicated.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
