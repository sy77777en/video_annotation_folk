    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A scarecrow-like character with a smiling, carved pumpkin for a head is shown wearing a purple hooded cloak. The character is standing in a tilled garden plot containing several leafy green plants with large, red, raspberry-like fruits. As the character moves, the plants disappear, and round, gold coins appear in their place.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the setting is an outdoor, grassy yard. A rectangular garden plot, enclosed by a pink-orange picket fence and a border of smooth gray stones, is the central feature. Within this plot, several raspberry bushes are harvested, causing them to vanish and leave behind two small green plants. The surrounding area includes more pink-orange picket fencing, a wooden house in the background, and a lit lantern on a post. Several overlay elements are visible: in the bottom left corner, a gold coin icon is next to a number that increases; at the bottom center is an inventory bar with various icons; and in the bottom right corner are two partially filled vertical bars, one blue and one yellow.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a high angle, looking down on the scene. A scarecrow-like character is initially positioned in the center of the frame, standing within a rectangular garden plot in the middle ground. This central plot contains several raspberry bushes. In the background, a house is visible at the top of the frame, with picket fences flanking the garden on the left and right. In the foreground, UI elements are fixed in place: a coin counter in the bottom left, an inventory bar at the bottom center, and two status bars in the bottom right. The character moves in a circular path within the central garden plot, causing the raspberry bushes to disappear and gold coins to appear in their place. The camera remains static throughout the clip.",
