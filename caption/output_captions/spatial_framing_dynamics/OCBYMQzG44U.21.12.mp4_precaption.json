    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures the unique interior architecture of a two-floor space. It begins with an aerial view, highlighting a tiled floor and a body of greenish water, before transitioning to an eye-level perspective that showcases the entire interior. A white spiral staircase with a simple metal railing elegantly curves upwards from a cylindrical base partially submerged in the water. White columns stand near the water's edge, contributing to the clean lines and geometric forms that define the space. The focus is on the environment itself, emphasizing its somewhat sterile, liminal atmosphere. A small, indistinct orange object is briefly visible near the water's edge, adding a minor detail to the composition.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is an indoor, brightly lit space with white tiled walls and floors. A white spiral staircase with silver metal railings curves downwards towards a lower level filled with greenish-blue water. White cylindrical pillars support the structure. A small, orange, somewhat cone-shaped object is partially submerged in the water on the lower level. The camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The wide shot initially presents a high-angle, aerial view. A tiled floor occupies the bottom foreground, with a body of greenish water extending into the center and upper middle ground. A white spiral staircase, originating from the top-left and center middle ground, curves downwards, its base situated in the water in the center middle ground. A metal railing is positioned in the bottom-left foreground, stretching towards the center middle ground. White columns are visible in the right middle ground adjacent to the water, and a small orange object rests in the center-left middle ground at the water's edge. White tiled walls form the background. The camera perspective subsequently transitions to an eye-level view, reframing the scene so that the lower level elements are positioned in the foreground and middle ground, and the staircase appears to ascend from the middle ground into the background.",
