    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an aerial scenery shot, initially focusing on a roof under construction, characterized by light brown oriented strand board (OSB) panels, some marked with blue chalk lines, and construction equipment like a ladder, a yellow power tool, and a safety harness. The camera then transitions to reveal an older, weathered wooden roof composed of dark brown planks, showing signs of age with gaps between the boards and remnants of black roofing material. There is no main subject as the camera's top-down perspective and movement emphasize the textures, materials, and overall state of the different roof surfaces, highlighting the contrast between new construction and aged structures rather than a specific focal point.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a bird's-eye perspective of a roof undergoing construction or repair during the daytime. Initially, the view focuses on newly installed light brown OSB (Oriented Strand Board) sheathing, characterized by its wood chip texture and rectangular panels. Various construction items are visible on and around this section, including a yellow power tool, an aluminum ladder leaning against the roof edge, a safety harness, yellow extension cords, and ropes. The surrounding ground shows green grass and a portion of a chain-link fence. As the drone moves, the view transitions to an older section of the roof, revealing weathered, dark brown wooden planks. These planks show signs of age, with some areas covered in black patches, possibly remnants of old roofing material or water damage, and some gaps between them.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video commences with a wide, top-down aerial shot, where light brown OSB panels of a roof under construction occupy the majority of the foreground, stretching from the bottom left towards the top right. An aluminum ladder is situated in the bottom left foreground, leaning against the roof's edge, while a yellow power tool is visible on the green grass in the bottom center foreground, adjacent to the roof. A yellow extension cord runs from the bottom left across the OSB panels. As the camera moves upwards and forwards, a safety harness and a circular saw appear in the top left foreground on the OSB, with tree branches casting shadows from the top left. A thick rope and wooden support planks then become visible across the OSB in the foreground. The camera continues its forward trajectory, transitioning the view: the new OSB roof recedes towards the bottom of the frame and then disappears, as an older, weathered roof composed of dark brown wooden planks enters from the top and gradually fills the entire foreground. These aged planks, showing gaps and black patches, dominate the foreground for the remainder of the video, while green grass and a gutter remain visible in the middle ground along the left edge of the frame. The top-down perspective is consistent throughout.",
