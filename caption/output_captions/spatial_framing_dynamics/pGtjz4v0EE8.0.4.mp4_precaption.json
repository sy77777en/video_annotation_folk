    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an interior scenery shot of a lavishly decorated, multi-tiered opera house. The architecture is overwhelmingly opulent, with curved balconies adorned in gold leaf, intricate carvings, and numerous glowing light fixtures. Each tier of seating boxes features painted medallions and decorative elements, all contributing to a sense of historical grandeur, with a particularly ornate royal box draped in rich, dark red velvet curtains at the center. There is no main subject in the video, as the shot is designed to capture the magnificent atmosphere and architectural scale of the entire auditorium. The focus is on the environment itself, emphasizing its opulence rather than any single person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The interior of the opulent, multi-tiered opera house, Teatro La Fenice in Venice, is shown from the audience's perspective in a timelapse. The scene is dominated by a warm, golden glow from numerous electric candelabra-style lights that line the curved balconies. The architecture is ornate, with every surface covered in gilded carvings, scrollwork, and decorative moldings. The fronts of the tiered boxes are adorned with green panels and small, circular paintings depicting portraits and cherubs. At the center, a prominent royal box is framed by elaborate gold statuary and features a deep red, draped curtain. The camera arcs to the right, keeping the theater box at the center of the frame, revealing the intricate details of the lavish decor.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, low-angle scenery shot of a multi-tiered opera house interior. Initially, an ornate royal box is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, flanked by curved, gilded balconies that extend from the middle ground to the background on the left and right sides. The camera then executes a slow arc to the right. This movement causes the royal box to shift from the center to the left-center of the frame, while the balconies on the right side move to occupy the center and right portions of the view. The low-angle perspective, looking up at the opulent tiers, is maintained throughout the shot.",
