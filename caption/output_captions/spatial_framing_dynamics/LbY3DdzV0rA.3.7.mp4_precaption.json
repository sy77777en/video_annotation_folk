    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot captured at night. The focus is not on a singular subject. A dark, stormy sky, tinged with deep purple and orange hues, dominates the frame as brilliant, forked lightning bolts repeatedly flash and strike down toward the distant horizon. Below, a highway cuts through the darkened terrain, its path defined by the continuous, glowing light trails of vehicles: bright white and yellow streaks from approaching headlights on the left, and red streaks from receding taillights on the right, all converging toward the horizon in the distance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, a straight highway stretches toward the horizon across a dark, flat landscape. The road is defined by long, continuous light trails from traffic: white and yellow streaks on the left and red streaks on the right. Above, the sky is filled with dark, heavy storm clouds. The scene is intermittently illuminated by powerful, branching bolts of white lightning that strike down from the clouds. In the distance, a faint orange glow on the horizon is visible beneath the storm, and vertical sheets of rain can be seen falling. The color of the sky shifts from a dark, reddish-purple to a brighter violet during the lightning flashes.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static extreme wide shot of a landscape at night. A highway occupies the bottom third of the frame, with light trails creating strong leading lines that start in the bottom-left and bottom-right foreground and converge toward a vanishing point in the center-background. A dark, silhouetted landscape stretches horizontally across the middle ground. The upper two-thirds of the frame are dominated by a stormy sky in the background. Intermittently, large bolts of lightning flash in the center and upper portions of the frame, striking down toward the horizon. The camera is positioned at a slightly elevated height, looking down the highway into the distance.",
