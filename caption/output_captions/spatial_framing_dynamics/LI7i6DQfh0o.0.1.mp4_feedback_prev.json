    "pre_caption": "In a tilted close-up shot, a pair of hands unfolds a grey fabric object in the center-foreground. Initially, a wooden mannequin occupies the bottom-left middle ground, with a wooden crate holding oranges and pasta in the top background. The frame then rapidly rotates, shifting the hands and fabric to the top right. This transition reveals vegetables and an orange clip in the middle ground on the left, while the crate and mannequin move to the bottom-right background. Throughout the shot, the text \"THAT UNFOLDS\" remains fixed in the center, and a \"*patent pending\" notice stays in the top right corner. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pair of light-skinned hands, emerging from white sleeves, unfolds a grey, soft, fabric-like object with a black zipper against a white tiled surface. The scene includes various food items: a cluster of bright orange oranges and a glass jar of pasta with a cork stopper are placed on top of a light-colored wooden crate. Nearby, a red pomegranate, a dark purple fig, and a small green succulent are visible. Green celery, a yellow bell pepper, and a red bell pepper are positioned on the surface and behind a bright orange plastic clip. A small, articulated wooden artist's mannequin stands in a dynamic pose. The white text \"THAT UNFOLDS\" is centered on the screen, while a black box in the upper right corner contains the white text \"*patent pending\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene with a tilted perspective features a white tiled surface and a wooden shelf. On the shelf are oranges, a pomegranate, a small succulent, a wooden artist's mannequin, and glass jars containing pasta and green onions. A person's hands unfold a gray fabric item against the surface, while in another view, fresh vegetables like celery and bell peppers are positioned behind an orange plastic clip. An overlay displays the white text \"THAT UNFOLDS\" in the center of the scene, and a black box in the top right corner contains the text \"*patent pending\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
