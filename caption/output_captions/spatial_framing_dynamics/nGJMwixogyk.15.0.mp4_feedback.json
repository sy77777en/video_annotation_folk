    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture a group of people and the surrounding street scene. At the start, a person with a stroller is positioned in the bottom center foreground, close to the camera\u2019s height, and quickly moves forward, exiting the frame. Two women in kimonos walk side by side on the right side of the street, occupying the middle ground and right-center of the frame as they move away from the camera. A woman in white stands near a shop entrance on the left, positioned in the middle ground and left side of the frame. Other people, including a man in a patterned shirt, are visible further along the street in the background, distributed across the center and right. The camera remains at an eye-level height, moving smoothly forward along the street, causing the foreground subjects to shift out of view while middle- and background subjects gradually become more prominent in the frame. The shops and buildings line both sides of the frame, creating a sense of depth and leading lines that draw the viewer\u2019s eye toward the background, where green hills are visible above the rooftops.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a group of people walking along a narrow street lined with shops. Two women wearing kimonos are walking side by side on the right side of the street. A person pushing a stroller is near the camera at the beginning of the video. Another woman, dressed in white and holding a bag, stands near a shop entrance on the left. Additional people, including a man in a short-sleeved patterned shirt, are visible further along the street. The group consists of adults and at least one child, with a variety of casual summer clothing and accessories.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, moves along a narrow outdoor street lined with small shops and traditional-style buildings under a clear blue sky in the late afternoon. The street is paved with textured stone and flanked by storefronts featuring awnings in shades of beige, orange, and yellow, with some displaying colorful merchandise and signs in Japanese. The buildings are constructed from wood and concrete, with sloped roofs and a mix of natural and painted finishes. Shadows stretch across the ground, indicating the low angle of the sun. In the background, green hills rise behind the buildings, and the overall scene is brightly lit with warm sunlight. People walk along the street, some carrying bags or umbrellas, and their placement adds a sense of movement and daily activity to the setting. No overlays or digital elements are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
