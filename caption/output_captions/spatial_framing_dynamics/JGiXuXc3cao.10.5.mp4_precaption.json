    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A digital map display features a dark, textured background overlaid with a white grid. A large, irregular area is outlined by a glowing, dashed red line. Within this boundary, a solid, glowing red line traces a path, starting horizontally, making a U-turn, and then proceeding in a parallel line to create a back-and-forth search pattern. This path is associated with a small, white, conical icon. White text boxes on the screen display changing latitude and longitude coordinates. In the bottom-left corner, a white circular icon contains a compass-like symbol.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A digital display shows a map with a dark, textured background overlaid with a white grid. A large, irregular area is outlined by a glowing red dashed line. Inside this area, a white conical icon is positioned. A solid red glowing line traces a path, starting horizontally and then making several right-angle turns, creating a search pattern. Overlays on the screen include text boxes displaying changing coordinates, with \"LONG\" values around 49.95 and \"LAT\" values initially at 41.38, followed by an update to 41.4. In the bottom-left corner, a circular icon contains a compass-like symbol.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a top-down view of a digital map display, where a white grid is overlaid on a dark, textured background that fills the frame. In the middle ground, a large, irregular area is outlined by a glowing, dashed red line that occupies the top, left, and right portions of the frame. A small, white, conical icon is positioned in the center-right. A solid, glowing red line is dynamically drawn in the middle ground, tracing a search pattern; it begins as a horizontal line near the icon, extends left, makes a U-turn, and then proceeds to draw subsequent parallel lines. In the foreground, text boxes are positioned at the top-center displaying longitude and on the right side displaying latitude, with their numerical values changing throughout the clip. A circular compass icon remains fixed in the bottom-left corner.",
