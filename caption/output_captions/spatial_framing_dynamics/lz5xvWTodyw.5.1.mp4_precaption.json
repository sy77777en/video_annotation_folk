    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, pixelated character is depicted with a dark blue, round head featuring a yellow bird's beak, a red cape fluttering on his back, and dark blue hands and legs. As the character runs, he leaves a white trail of dust. In the upper right portion of the scene, a red and white candle compass is placed over a dark circular shadow, with the red candle marking a white \"N\" to indicate north. The user interface in the bottom left corner displays three golden feathers and two blue feathers. In the top left corner, a counter shows the number 104 next to an icon of a coin.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video with a pixel art style, the scene is set within a deep, brown, rocky canyon. The textured canyon walls have horizontal striations, and small, sandy-colored ledges with sparse green vegetation are scattered at various heights. On one of the larger ledges, a red and white striped beach umbrella is visible. Overlays are present on the screen. In the top-left corner, a coin icon is displayed next to the number \"104,\" both written in white using a pixel font. The bottom-left corner shows a row of five golden feathers that gradually turn blue as the character climbs. In the top-right corner, a red and white candle compass is placed over a dark circular shadow, with the red candle indicating \"N\" for north.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a high-angle perspective, looking down into a deep, brown, rocky canyon that serves as the background. A small, bird-like character begins near the center of the frame in the middle ground and moves diagonally up the canyon wall toward the top right. Scattered throughout the middle ground are sandy ledges, with a red and white umbrella visible on a larger ledge in the upper right. Several UI elements are overlaid in the foreground: a coin counter is fixed in the top left corner, a feather counter is in the bottom left, and a compass is in the top right.",
