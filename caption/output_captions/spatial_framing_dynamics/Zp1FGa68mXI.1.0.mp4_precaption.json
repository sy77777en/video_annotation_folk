    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of this time-lapse video is a single, bright red raspberry, which appears slightly shriveled and dehydrated, resting on a white surface. The raspberry has a bumpy texture composed of many small drupelets and a hollow center. Several small, black ants, the secondary subjects, are seen crawling on and around the fruit. These ants have segmented bodies, six legs, and long antennae. Red crumbs and particles, presumably from the raspberry, are scattered on the white surface around it. A text overlay in the lower-left corner displays a counter that progresses from \"74 HOURS\" to \"83 HOURS,\" along with the text \"3 DAYS.\" In the lower right, the word \"TEMPONAUT\" is visible, and a black, stylized eye logo is in the upper-right corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting, a single, bright red raspberry rests on a plain white surface, which is scattered with small red crumbs. Several small, dark ants crawl over and around the fruit. The scene is presented as a time-lapse. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays a counter in white text that progresses from \"75 HOURS\" onward, with \"3 DAYS\" written underneath. In the bottom right corner, the word \"TEMPONAUT\" is overlaid in a white, stylized font, and a black and white eye icon is overlaid in the top right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up, high-angle shot where a single raspberry is the central subject, positioned in the middle of the frame on a white surface in the middle ground. Several ants are initially seen crawling on and around the raspberry. As the time-lapse progresses, the ants move quickly around the central fruit before gradually leaving the frame, with most gone by the end of the clip. Red crumbs are scattered on the surface surrounding the raspberry. Text overlays are fixed in the foreground, with a time counter in the bottom left, the word \"TEMPONAUT\" in the bottom right, and a logo in the top right. The camera and the raspberry remain static throughout the shot.",
