    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a dark convertible limousine positioned in the middle ground, moving from left to right across the center of the frame. An American flag is mounted on the front right fender in the middle ground, while a building, parked cars, and a crowd are visible in the background. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, pans to the right to follow the vehicle's movement, causing the background to blur. As the camera tracks the car, the framing tightens, transitioning into a medium shot that focuses on the passengers from the waist up.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark-colored convertible limousine with whitewall tires is shown carrying several light-skinned men. An American flag is mounted on the front passenger-side fender, and another dark flag is on the driver's side. In the back seat, a man with brown hair wearing a dark suit, identified as John F. Kennedy, smiles and waves. Next to him sit two men in dark suits. In the second row of the convertible, a man in a white military uniform with a peaked cap is seated, and another man in a dark suit is next to him. The driver of the car is wearing a gray suit.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a daytime, outdoor scene, a dark-colored convertible limousine with whitewall tires moves from left to right across a paved area. An American flag is mounted on the front right fender of the vehicle. In the background, a crowd of people and numerous parked cars are visible in front of a large, nondescript building. The camera pans to follow the car, causing the background to appear blurred with motion. The footage has a grainy quality characteristic of older color film.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
