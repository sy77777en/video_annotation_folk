    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two individuals viewed from behind, both wearing red long-sleeved outer garments and helmets. The main subject, seated in a red kayak, is wearing a black and green life vest and a grey helmet with an orange and white \"Teva\" logo. They are actively paddling with a double-bladed paddle through turbulent water within a narrow canyon defined by steep, grey, rocky walls on either side. These people are navigating the kayak forward, moving through the confined waterway towards a more agitated section of whitewater ahead, with the focus remaining on the person in the back.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot captures the perspective from a red kayak navigating a narrow, rocky canyon during the day. The steep canyon walls, composed of gray, textured rock, rise closely on either side of the dark, moving water. Two kayakers are featured in the scene: the leading kayaker is in front, while the one behind, wearing a red jacket, a black and green life vest, and a gray helmet, is visible paddling to propel the kayak forward. The video progresses from calmer water into faster-moving white water rapids within the confined space of the canyon.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a medium shot focused on the main kayaker, who occupies the center foreground of the frame throughout. The red kayak they are in is also positioned in the center foreground. The kayaker uses a paddle, which moves across the center and sides of the frame in the foreground. The water fills the lower and central portions of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. Steep, grey, rocky canyon walls flank the scene on the left and right sides, running from the foreground into the background. A second kayaker is partially visible ahead in the center middle ground. The main kayaker and their kayak move forward, remaining centered in the frame, navigating through the canyon as the water transitions from relatively calm to turbulent whitewater in the middle ground. The camera is positioned above the main subject, maintaining a consistent perspective from behind.",
