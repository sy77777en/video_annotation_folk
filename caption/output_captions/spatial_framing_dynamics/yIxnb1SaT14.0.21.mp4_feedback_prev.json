    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a Parisian street corner at night, with the focus on the scenery rather than a specific subject. In the left foreground, a building stands next to an illuminated Christmas tree, while a larger building featuring a prominent golden sunburst sculpture occupies the right middle ground. The Vend\u00f4me Column is visible in the center background. The shot is dynamic, employing a time-lapse effect where red and white light trails from traffic sweep across the bottom of the frame, moving from the middle ground toward the foreground. A few pedestrians are positioned in the left foreground near the tree. The camera is set at a standard height, and a watermark is present in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a vibrant cityscape time-lapse of a Parisian street corner at night, likely near Place Vend\u00f4me, identifiable by the prominent column in the background. The scene is imbued with a festive atmosphere, featuring a glowing Christmas tree on a corner and grand, historic buildings with warmly lit windows, one of which is adorned with a massive, golden sunburst sculpture. There is no single main subject, as the time-lapse technique intentionally blurs individual elements like cars and people to emphasize the overall environment and its dynamic energy. This is achieved through the long exposure, which transforms the movement of traffic into brilliant red and white light trails that streak across the reflective pavement, creating a visual spectacle that makes the city's lively pulse the true focus of the shot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse, long-exposure shot captures a bustling street corner in Paris at night, identified by a street sign for Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 and the Vend\u00f4me Column visible in the background. The scene is festively decorated with a large, brightly lit green Christmas tree on the left sidewalk. A prominent building on the right features an elaborate, illuminated golden sunburst sculpture on its facade. The wet pavement reflects the ambient light from ornate streetlights and buildings. The movement of vehicles is rendered as dynamic red and white light trails that sweep across the road. A few pedestrians stand on the corner. A watermark in the bottom right corner reads \"MATHIEU STANI\u0106 CINEMATOGRAPHER\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
