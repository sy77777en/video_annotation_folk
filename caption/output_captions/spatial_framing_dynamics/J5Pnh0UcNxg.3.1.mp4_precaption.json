    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A fair-skinned woman with long, reddish-brown hair and bangs is shown in profile in a dimly lit room. She is wearing a dark-colored tank top with thin straps. Her head is slightly bowed as she faces towards the left of the scene. The lighting is low-key, with a cool, blue-toned light source illuminating the left side of her face and body, while the right side remains in deep shadow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A dimly lit indoor space at night is bathed in a cool, blueish light, creating deep shadows. On the right, a woman with reddish-brown hair stands in profile. In the background, a full-length mirror on a wooden stand has a pink cloth draped over it. The view slowly pans to the left, revealing a large potted plant in the corner and a small table holding a candelabra and a box. A white curtain hangs on the right side of the room.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a woman in profile, positioned on the right side of the frame in the middle ground. In the background on the left, a full-length mirror and a curtain are visible. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, slowly pans to the left, revealing more of the room. As the camera moves, a large potted plant and a small table holding a candelabra appear in the middle ground to the left of the woman, who remains stationary on the right side of the frame.",
