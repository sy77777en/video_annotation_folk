    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a video game character is positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, on a narrow ledge of a large rock cliff. The cliff face fills the background and middle ground. Patches of green foliage are visible at the bottom, top left, and center-right of the frame. On a separate ledge in the upper right, also in the middle ground, are several small, dark objects and a single red object. The character performs a short jump to an adjacent ledge, remaining in the center of the static frame. The camera is positioned above the character, looking down.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A video game character with a slender build and dark-colored hair is shown on a rocky cliff face. The character is wearing white and brown clothing and has a long, staff-like object on its back. It is positioned in mid-air, as if jumping or climbing between ledges. On a separate ledge to the right, there is a small cluster of dark, round objects and a single red, mushroom-like object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the scene is set on a steep, dark gray rock cliff face. Bright green foliage, including bushes with small white flowers and ferns, grows in patches from the crevices of the angular rocks. A character in white and brown attire performs a short jump along a narrow ledge. On a separate, higher ledge to the right, several small, dark, round objects and a single red mushroom are clustered together. The environment is lit as if during the daytime. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays the white text, \"Drop.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
