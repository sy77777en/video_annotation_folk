    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features a night sky filled with white star trails, which appear as long, bright streaks against the dark expanse. The trails on the left side of the scene curve in concentric arcs, while those on the right are more linear and diagonal. In the foreground, the complete, black silhouette of a large, gnarled tree stands against the sky. Its thick trunk is positioned in the center, with several bare, twisted branches reaching upward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an upward-looking perspective, a time-lapse captures the movement of stars across a dark night sky. The stars are rendered as long, white streaks of light, creating a pattern of motion. On the left side, the trails form distinct, curved arcs, while on the right, they appear as straighter, more parallel lines. Dominating the foreground is the dark, featureless silhouette of a large, gnarled tree trunk and its bare branches, starkly contrasted against the celestial display.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a static, low-angle perspective looking upward, the scene is dominated by the black silhouette of a large, gnarled tree in the foreground. The main trunk occupies the center of the frame, extending from the bottom edge upwards, with smaller silhouetted branches visible in the bottom left and bottom right foreground. In the background, the night sky is filled with white star trails. On the left side of the frame, these trails form concentric, curved arcs, while on the right side, they appear as more linear, diagonal streaks.",
