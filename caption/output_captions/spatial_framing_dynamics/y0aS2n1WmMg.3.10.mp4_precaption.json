    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with light skin and facial stubble is lying on his back on the floor, his face tilted toward the camera with his eyes open. A second person, visible only from the waist down, enters the frame from the left, wearing dark-colored trousers, and walks behind the man on the floor.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit room with a monochromatic blue-green color scheme, viewed from a low, upward-facing angle. A large, dark leather armchair with studded arms is positioned slightly to the right of the center, with a patterned throw blanket draped over both its back and seat. A single lamp with a cylindrical shade casts a small circle of light on the ceiling to the left. In the foreground, a person lies on the floor. During the clip, a pair of legs in dark trousers walks into view. The scene is presented through a viewfinder-style frame, with several white text overlays: a timer reading \"00:00:00\" in the top left, \"0-LUX\" in the top right, and \"SP\" later appears in the bottom left.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: In the lower part of the frame, a recumbent person\u2019s face is shown; subsequently, another person enters from the left of the frame, with only their lower body shown in a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene is framed from a low angle, with a man's face shown in a close-up in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A large armchair is positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right of center. In the background, a lamp is visible in the top left corner. A second person, captured in a medium shot showing their lower body, enters from the left of the frame and walks into the middle ground, moving behind the man on the floor and toward the right side of the scene. The entire shot is presented through a viewfinder frame, with text overlays in the top left, top right, and bottom left corners.",
