    "pre_caption": "In this medium shot, a man in a black coat is positioned in the center of the frame, walking away from the camera down a subway aisle. His large right hand is in the right foreground, holding onto a vertical pole. Other passengers are visible in the middle ground, seated on the left and right sides of the car. As the man walks forward, moving deeper into the background, his left hand enters the frame from the left to grab another pole in the middle ground. The camera remains static and at the subject's level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of this animated video is a tall, slender man with pale skin and spiky black hair, seen from behind as he walks down the aisle of a subway car. He is dressed in a long, black coat. His right hand, which is disproportionately large and skeletal, is extended to grip a vertical pole, followed by his left hand, which is also large. Other passengers are visible in the stylized scene. On the right, a seated man with a long face, grayish skin, and spiky black hair, wearing a blue hoodie, looks forward. Next to him sits a woman with long dark hair and a pale complexion, wearing a dark hooded garment. On the left, another passenger, a skeletal-looking figure in a green jacket, is also present.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a moving subway car, depicted in a sketchy, angular animation style. The interior features light greenish-blue walls and a narrow central aisle flanked by rows of tan-colored seats. A figure in a long black coat walks down the aisle away from the viewer, passing other seated passengers. Vertical metal poles are positioned along the aisle for support, and a set of doors is visible at the far end of the car.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
