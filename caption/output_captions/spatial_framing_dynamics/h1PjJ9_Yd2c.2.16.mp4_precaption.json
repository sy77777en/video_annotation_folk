    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a young woman with long, brown hair tied in a high ponytail, wearing a grey t-shirt, standing with her back to the viewer and looking into a mirror. Her reflection shows her with light skin and brown hair pulled back from her face. The reflection is looking down at a small, cylindrical, turquoise-colored spray can held in her hands, which she then raises. Two black bands are visible on her left wrist and forearm in the reflection, appearing on the right side of the mirrored image.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead. The setting is an indoor bathroom during the daytime, characterized by plain, light-colored walls. A large, rectangular mirror dominates the view, reflecting the same woman whose shoulder we are looking over. She has brown hair, wears a grey t-shirt, and holds a small, cylindrical, teal-colored spray can, which she takes the cap off of and raises, releasing a small spray. Natural light enters the room through a window with horizontal slats, located to the right of the mirror.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot. A young woman, seen from her back, occupies the foreground on the right side of the frame. Her reflection is visible in a large mirror positioned in the center-left and middle ground. This reflection, also in the middle ground, initially holds a small spray can low in her hands, then raises the can slightly upwards. To the right of the mirror, a window with horizontal slats is visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
