    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light silver four-door sedan drives along a dirt road, approaching and then passing an olive green Ford F-150 pickup truck that is parked on the right. The pickup truck is positioned near a weathered, unpainted wooden house with some windows featuring light blue shutters. As the sedan comes to a stop, a man wearing dark pants is visible walking from the back of the house towards the car. The scene is set in a wooded area with numerous trees, including tall pines and a palm tree visible to the left of the road.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a rural, wooded area with a dirt road leading towards a rustic, unpainted wooden house. The house has visible windows with blue shutters and a porch. A dark gray Ford F-150 pickup truck is parked on the dirt near the house. A silver Chevrolet Malibu sedan drives up the dirt road and parks behind the pickup truck. The area is surrounded by tall trees, including some with Spanish moss, and patches of green grass. The sky is overcast.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The wide shot, filmed at subject level, initially shows a silver sedan in the middle ground, left of center, driving along a dirt road that extends from the foreground. A dark pickup truck is parked in the middle ground on the right, with a wooden house visible in the background, also on the right. Numerous trees populate the foreground, middle ground, and background across the frame, with a distinct palm tree in the middle ground to the left of the road. The sedan moves from the left, diagonally towards the right and slightly into the foreground, then turns right to park in the middle ground, center-right, behind the stationary pickup truck. As the sedan stops, a man appears from the background on the right, near the house, and walks towards the middle ground, center-right, approaching the newly parked sedan.",
