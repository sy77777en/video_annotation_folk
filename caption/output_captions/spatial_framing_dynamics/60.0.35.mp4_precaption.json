    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two young women interact on a metal grid fence under a clear blue sky. The woman on the right, with long, curly dark hair, sits atop the fence, wearing a red long-sleeved crop top, black and white patterned pants, and a bright yellow backpack. To her left, another woman with long, dark hair climbs over the fence. She is wearing a yellow t-shirt, black pants, white sneakers, and a black cap. They are reaching their hands toward one another in a hand slap gesture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene is captured from a low angle during the daytime, looking up towards a clear, light blue sky. The central feature is a tall, metallic fence with a grid pattern, which extends across the view. Two people are interacting at the top of this fence. On the right side, an individual wearing a red top, patterned pants, and a bright yellow backpack is straddling the top rail. On the left side, a person in a yellow shirt and black pants is positioned. In the background, a single thin, dark pole is visible against the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a low-angle full shot, two women are positioned in the foreground on a metal grid fence. The woman in the yellow shirt occupies the left side of the frame, climbing the fence, while the woman in the red shirt sits atop the fence on the right. The fence itself extends horizontally across the middle ground. In the background, a clear blue sky fills the upper half of the frame, with a single thin pole visible to the left of the center. The two women reach their hands toward the center of the frame to interact as the camera remains static.",
