    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a painted wooden nesting doll and a hand interacting with it. Initially, the doll is positioned upright in the center of the frame, in the middle ground against a plain white background. The hand, with light skin and slightly curled fingers, enters from the left, positioned in the foreground. The camera is at the same height as the subjects, emphasizing the interaction. As the hand flicks the doll, the doll moves from its upright position to lying on its side, transitioning from the center to the bottom right of the frame, remaining in the middle ground. The minimalistic setting and even lighting highlight the doll's intricate design and the hand's movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a painted wooden nesting doll, primarily blue with floral patterns and a depiction of a musical instrument on the front. Initially upright, the doll is flicked by a hand with light skin and slightly curled fingers, causing it to fall and lie on its side. The focus is on the interaction, emphasizing the doll's intricate design and the hand's movement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases a traditional Russian nesting doll against a plain white background. The minimalistic setting and even lighting emphasize the doll's design.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
