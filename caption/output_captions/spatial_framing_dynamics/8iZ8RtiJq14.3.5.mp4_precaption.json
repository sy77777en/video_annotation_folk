    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A mannequin-like figure with a black, featureless head stands on the right, dressed in a grey long-sleeved shirt, a black tie, a black belt, and dark pants, with its arms at its sides. To the left, two other mannequin-like figures with silver metallic heads and arms are bent over a long table. They are both wearing tan short-sleeved shirts, brown belts, and grey pants, and each is interacting with an open cardboard box placed on the table in front of them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, undefined indoor space, a long, white table is illuminated by a red glow. On the left, two mannequins with silver metallic arms and heads are dressed in tan shirts and grey pants. They are positioned bent over the table, interacting with open cardboard boxes. To the right, standing apart against the black background, is a third mannequin dressed in a grey shirt, black tie, and dark pants. This figure is starkly lit, with red light on one side and white light on the other.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium full shot, filmed at the subjects' level, captures a static scene. On the right side of the frame, a mannequin stands in the middle ground. To the left, two other mannequins are positioned in the middle ground, bent over a long table that extends from the left edge of the frame towards the center. In front of these two figures, on the table, are two open cardboard boxes, also located on the left side of the frame in the middle ground. The entire composition remains stationary throughout the shot.",
