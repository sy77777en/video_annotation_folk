    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on an arm extending into the frame from the top. The arm, positioned in the foreground and occupying the upper central part of the frame, holds an orange jacket sleeve that hangs downward toward the bottom of the frame. The arm is clad in a mustard-colored long-sleeve garment and wears a black wristwatch. This arm and the orange fabric it holds dominate the foreground, while the background consists of distant, hazy mountains spread across the middle ground and background. The mountains appear faint and occupy the lower half of the frame, creating a contrast with the vibrant orange fabric. The camera remains steady, maintaining a consistent shot size and angle throughout the sequence, with no noticeable changes in the spatial positioning of the elements. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing the arm and fabric in sharp focus against the softer, more distant backdrop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a close-up of an arm entering the frame from the top, holding an orange jacket sleeve that extends out of the frame at the bottom. The arm, clad in a mustard-colored long-sleeve garment and adorned with a black wristwatch, stands out against a backdrop of distant, hazy mountains. The focus is on the contrast between the bright orange fabric and the muted tones of the environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting with a mountainous landscape in the background, characterized by misty, overcast weather. The scene is dominated by a hand holding an orange fabric, possibly a jacket, which stands out against the muted tones of the environment. The fabric appears soft and slightly crumpled, with a bright, solid color that contrasts with the grayish-blue hues of the distant mountains. The time of day is clearly daytime, as indicated by the diffused lighting from the cloudy sky, which evenly illuminates the scene. The overall atmosphere is calm and serene, with the focus on the interaction between the hand and the fabric, set against the expansive natural backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
