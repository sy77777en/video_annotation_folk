    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit control room, a woman with short, blonde hair, seen from the side, operates a large mixing console. Behind her, two people with dark, shoulder-length hair sit at desks with papers, and a third person is partially visible further back. They are all focused on a large bank of monitors. As the view moves closer to the screens, the camera focuses on one large monitor displaying a wide shot of a brightly lit game show set with a circular stage, while another monitor shows a medium shot of a middle-aged man with short, light-colored hair. He is wearing a light blue button-down shirt and dark trousers, standing with his hands on his hips against a purple, patterned backdrop.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark television production control room, where several people are seated at a long blue console. The console is fitted with a large mixing board featuring numerous illuminated buttons and faders. In front of them, a wall of CRT monitors displays various camera feeds. A large central monitor shows a wide view of a game show set, which has a circular stage and is lit with blue and purple lights. An adjacent large screen shows a man standing against a purple, textured background. Other smaller monitors show different angles of the production. On the desk, there are papers and a microphone. A white text overlay in the bottom left corner reads, \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire - The Making Of Millionaire (2017)\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a side view of a row of three sitting people in a medium close-up shot, watching a panel of screens in front of them. The camera then pans right and moves forward toward the screens, revealing a few monitors displaying the same man.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up side view of three people in a control room. A woman in the foreground occupies the left side of the frame, operating a console at the bottom. Two other people are seated behind her in the middle ground, extending towards the center. In the background on the right, a wall of monitors is visible. The camera then pans right and pushes in, moving towards the monitor wall. This movement shifts the focus entirely to the screens, which come to fill the frame. In the final composition, two large monitors are centered: the one on the left displays a wide shot of a game show set, and the one on the right shows a man standing. Smaller monitors are positioned above and below them. A text overlay is present in the bottom left corner of the frame throughout the shot. The camera is positioned at approximately the seated subjects' height.",
