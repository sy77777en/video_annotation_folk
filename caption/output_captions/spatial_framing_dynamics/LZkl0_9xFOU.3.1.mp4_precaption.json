    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on the back of a person's head, showing their short brown hair as they look at a computer monitor. The monitor has a dark screen with a glowing white border, displaying a user interface with a glowing purple profile icon of a person's silhouette inside a circle, with the word \"Xenomega\" below it. The view then changes to a side profile of a mannequin-like figure with a smooth, featureless face. This figure has shaggy, medium-length brown hair and is wearing a light-colored t-shirt, all illuminated by a strong green light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder perspective, a person with brown, medium-length hair sits in a dimly lit room cast in a green glow, facing a computer monitor. The monitor displays a dark interface framed by a glowing white border, featuring a central user icon with a purple aura. In the background, a shelf and a poster are faintly visible against the wall. White text is overlaid in the lower right corner, spelling out the name \"Dylan Wheeler.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an over-the-shoulder shot, where the back of a person's head is positioned in the left foreground. A computer monitor occupies the center-right of the frame in the middle ground, with a shelf visible in the top left background. The shot then cuts to a close-up of a mannequin-like figure, which is framed from the side and fills the left and center foreground. In the background, a poster is partially visible on the right, while text appears as an overlay in the lower right corner of the frame.",
