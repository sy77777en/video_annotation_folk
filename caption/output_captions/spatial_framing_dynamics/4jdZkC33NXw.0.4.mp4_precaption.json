    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a tranquil residential scenery shot, capturing a quiet, modern Japanese suburban street on a rainy day. The asphalt road is slick and reflective from the rain, mirroring the overcast sky. On both sides of the narrow street, contemporary houses with clean lines and dark or neutral-colored facades are visible, with cars like a prominent red Mini Cooper and a black Toyota Prius parked neatly in designated spaces and under carports. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is instead on the serene and slightly melancholic atmosphere created by the steady rain and the quiet, orderly environment of the neighborhood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a quiet, rainy day on a narrow residential street in a Japanese suburb. The wet asphalt road reflects the overcast sky, with rain visibly falling throughout the scene. Modern two-story houses, one dark gray and another light gray, line the street. On the left, a red Mini Cooper is parked in a lot next to a silver car. On the right, a black Toyota Prius and a black minivan are parked in front of a house, with the minivan situated under a simple white carport. Utility poles and power lines run along the right side of the street, and small green trees and bushes are planted alongside the properties.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, static scenery shot of a residential street. The wet asphalt road occupies the center of the frame, creating a strong leading line from the foreground into the background. On the left, a silver car is partially visible in the bottom-left foreground, while a red Mini Cooper and another red vehicle are parked in the left middle ground next to modern houses. On the right, a black car is parked in the right middle ground, with another black vehicle under a white carport just behind it. Utility poles and wires line the right side of the street, stretching from the middle ground into the background. The camera is positioned at eye level, offering a straight-on view down the quiet, rain-slicked street.",
