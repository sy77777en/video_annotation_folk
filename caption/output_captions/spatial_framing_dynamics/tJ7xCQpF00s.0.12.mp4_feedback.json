    "pre_caption": "This wide shot frames a man standing in the middle ground on the right, leaning against a pillar. A subway train enters from the left side of the frame, also in the middle ground. As the train moves rapidly from left to right, its motion-blurred form fills the left and center of the screen, passing the stationary man. An escalator is positioned in the background on the far right. The man remains fixed in his position on the right as the train recedes into the background, creating a dynamic where the composition shifts around the static subject. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a tattoo on his left arm stands on a subway platform, leaning against a white pillar with his hands behind his back. He is wearing a black short-sleeved t-shirt, black pants, a black beanie, and black sneakers with white stripes and red soles. His body is in profile to the camera, but his face is turned away from the viewer, watching a silver-colored subway train with bright headlights and a red digital sign positioned on the top of each cabin as it moves past him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person POV, as if through a character's eyes, the scene is set in a dimly lit underground subway station. A silver, metallic train with bright headlights and a red digital sign blurs as it speeds past on the tracks, moving through the arched tunnel. The station platform is made of concrete with a blue tactile strip along the edge and is lined with white rectangular pillars. The environment is illuminated by a row of long fluorescent lights on the ceiling, casting a greenish glow. In the middleground, an escalator ascends from the platform level behind a sign that partially reads \"MADISON,\" at the location of a staircase. A man dressed in black stands on the platform, leaning against a pillar as he watches the train pass.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
