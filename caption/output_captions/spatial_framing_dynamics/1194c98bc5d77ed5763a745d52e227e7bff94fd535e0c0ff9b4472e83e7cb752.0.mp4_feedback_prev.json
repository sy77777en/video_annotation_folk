    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot filmed from above, a mixture of whole spices is scattered across the center and right of a dark pan, occupying the middle ground. A wooden spatula is positioned in the foreground, starting at the bottom left of the frame. It moves diagonally toward the upper right, stirring the spices and changing their arrangement within the pan.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light brown wooden spatula with several long, parallel slots stirs a mixture of whole spices in a dark pan. The spice blend includes small, light green, oval-shaped fennel seeds, dark brown pieces of broken star anise, thin shards of brown cinnamon or cassia bark, and small, reddish-purple peppercorns. The various spices are scattered across the bottom surface of the pan.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a close, overhead perspective, a mixture of whole spices is stirred in a dark pan. The blend consists of light green, oval-shaped fennel seeds, dark reddish peppercorns, and brown, woody shards of bark and star anise. A light-colored wooden spatula with horizontal slots moves through the frame, gently tossing the spices across the pan's surface.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
