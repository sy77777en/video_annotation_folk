    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a first-person perspective of two light-skinned hands holding a black digital camera, its rear screen displaying the live view of the scene. The camera is aimed at several traditional wooden boats, predominantly dark brown or red with distinctive yellow accents on their high, curved sterns and bows, moored at a stone-paved quay. These boats, possibly rabelo boats, feature masts and some rigging, with small flags visible. A tall, slender, dark lamppost stands on the left edge of the quay, and further left, a multi-story building with visible windows lines the waterfront. The entire scene is enveloped in thick, grey fog, which heavily obscures the background, although the faint silhouette of a bridge and a distant building on a hill can be discerned through the haze over the calm water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, shows a foggy riverside scene. Several traditional wooden boats, dark-colored with yellow sterns, are moored alongside a stone-paved quay. Thick fog hangs heavy over the water, obscuring a distant bridge and buildings on the opposite bank under a pale, overcast sky, likely during the early morning. To the left of the frame, a tall, dark lamppost stands on the quay, and further left, multi-story buildings line the waterfront. Hands holding a black digital camera are visible in the lower portion of the frame, with the camera screen displaying the real-time scene of the boats and the foggy river beyond.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person viewpoint, hands holding a camera are positioned in the foreground at the bottom center. The scene features several boats moored in the middle ground, initially centered, alongside a stone quay extending from the bottom left towards the center. A lamppost is visible in the middle ground on the far left, with buildings further left behind it. The river occupies the middle ground and background to the right, enveloped in thick fog that obscures distant structures visible as faint silhouettes in the background center. The camera then pans slightly to the left, causing the lamppost and buildings to shift towards the center-left of the frame, while the boats move relatively towards the right side. The hands and camera remain consistently positioned in the foreground bottom center during the pan. The camera perspective appears to be at eye level, looking slightly downwards towards the quay and boats.",
