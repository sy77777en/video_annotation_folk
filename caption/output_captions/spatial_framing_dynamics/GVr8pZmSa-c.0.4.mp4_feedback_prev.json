    "pre_caption": "The video commences with a medium shot, where a wooden sailing ship is positioned in the center of the frame and occupies the middle ground, surrounded by turbulent ocean waters in the foreground, middle ground, and background. The camera is initially at the ship's level. The shot then transitions to a wide shot as the camera moves to a position above the ship. In this wide shot, the ship, remaining centrally located in the frame and in the middle ground, is depicted tilting significantly to its port side as large waves impact it. Subsequently, the ship's stern section submerges, and the entire vessel sinks beneath the ocean surface, which continues to fill the foreground, middle ground, and background of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a wooden sailing ship navigating through rough, turbulent ocean waters. The ship is characterized by its large, dark gray sails and detailed wooden structure, including a prominent deck and railings. The vessel appears sturdy, with visible cabins and masts. The ocean is depicted with high, crashing waves, emphasizing the ship's struggle against the elements. The ship's orientation changes from being prominently visible to partially submerged, suggesting a challenging journey through the stormy sea.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a wooden sailing ship, featuring dark gray, unfurled sails and a railed deck, caught in a turbulent, dark blue ocean under dark, stormy skies. A few small, pale figures are visible on its deck. Large, deep blue waves relentlessly batter the wooden vessel, causing it to rock violently and tilt precariously. The ship is progressively overwhelmed by the churning water, its stern section submerges, and the entire vessel sinks beneath the surface.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
