    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, filmed from a spectator's viewpoint in an outdoor sports stadium, initially shows several people in the foreground. Most prominent is a man with light skin, wearing a grey hooded sweatshirt and a dark green baseball cap, viewed from his left rear as he watches the game. Beside him are other spectators, including one in a white baseball cap and another in a dark collared shirt, while a person with a purple hat is seated in front. The camera then pans left, transitioning to a wider shot of the American football game in progress. The green field is marked with white lines, a white \"N\" at the center, and large white lettering spelling \"WILDCATS\" on a purple background in the end zone. The white goalposts stand prominently on the field. Numerous football players in contrasting uniforms are visible as small figures on the field. The surrounding stands are densely packed with a large crowd, many wearing purple and gold attire. A distinctive, light-colored, multi-story building inscribed with \"RYAN FIELD\" is visible at the beginning but disappears from view once the camera pans. Tall floodlight towers are also visible. The pan concludes by showing more of the expansive field and the crowded opposite stands.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A wide shot from the upper stands of a crowded football stadium, Ryan Field, captures a game under an overcast sky. The green field below is marked with white yard lines and features a large purple end zone with \"WILDCATS\" written in white. Two teams are visible on the field near the touchlines. The stadium is filled with thousands of spectators, many dressed in purple, packing the stands on all sides. In the background, beyond the stadium, a dense line of green trees is visible, with a city skyline in the far distance. A prominent tan-colored building with \"RYAN FIELD\" inscribed on its side stands at one corner of the stadium. The perspective pans slightly to the left, offering a broader view of the entire stadium and the game unfolding below.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an outdoor sports stadium during a game, with the stands full of spectators. The camera is positioned among the audience. At the start, the foreground shows a medium shot of some spectators from the left rear of them, occupying the lower left corner of the frame. The remaining space shows a more distant view of the stands and the stadium. The camera then pans left, showing a wider view of the stadium and the opposite stands.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle medium shot from the upper stands, featuring spectators in the foreground who occupy the lower right portion of the frame. A purple railing runs along the bottom edge. In the middle ground to the left, a portion of the football field is visible, while the opposite stands and a large building inscribed with \"RYAN FIELD\" are positioned in the middle ground and background on the right. The camera then pans left, shifting the composition to a wide, high-angle shot of the stadium. As the pan concludes, the initial spectators are no longer in view, replaced by the back of a person's head in the bottom center foreground. The football field now dominates the middle ground, stretching across the frame, with the expansive, crowded stands on the far side filling the background.",
