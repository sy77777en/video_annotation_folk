    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a person with light skin walks barefoot. The view is directed downwards, showing their feet, the lower portion of their loose-fitting blue pants, and the hem of a white shirt. They are walking across a patio made of large, irregularly shaped flagstones in shades of tan and gray. The camera follows their movement and then tilts up to reveal a large, green lawn bordered by a wooden fence.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, follows a barefoot person wearing blue jeans walking across a rustic floor of large, uneven flagstones. The camera moves forward, transitioning from an indoor space onto an outdoor stone patio. It then tilts upward to reveal a large, vibrant green lawn enclosed by a wooden fence, with a rural landscape and trees visible under a cloudy sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the shot is initially directed downwards, capturing a pair of bare feet in the bottom-center foreground as they walk across a flagstone floor that fills the entire frame. The camera moves forward, maintaining this downward view. It then smoothly tilts upward, causing the stone patio to recede to the bottom of the frame, now serving as the foreground. This tilt reveals a large green lawn occupying the middle ground, enclosed by a wooden fence. In the background, a rural landscape with trees and a cloudy sky extends into the distance.",
