    "pre_caption": "A full shot shows a 2D animated red sports car in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a gray road. The car moves from left to right across the frame, while small black lines in the white background move from right to left. The camera remains stationary at the car's height, maintaining a consistent side-profile view throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A 2D animation depicts a dark red, two-door sports car with a sleek, low-profile body. The car features a black roof and black lower body panels. Its wheels are dark gray with numerous thin, yellow spokes. Positioned on the front hood of the car is a black video camera attached to a white mount, oriented towards the car's windshield. The car is shown in profile, facing to the right, on a gray road with white dashed lines.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A two-dimensional animation shows a red sports car with a black roof and a camera mounted on its hood. The car moves from left to right across a grey road marked with white dashed lines, its dark grey wheels with yellow spokes spinning. The entire scene is set against a plain white background, featuring small, scattered black horizontal lines that shift leftward, resembling rocks being passed by the moving car.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",
