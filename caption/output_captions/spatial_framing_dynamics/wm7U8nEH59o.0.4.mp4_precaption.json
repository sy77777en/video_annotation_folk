    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **On a multi-lane city street at night, flanked by tall, dark buildings with illuminated windows, several vehicles are present under the glow of streetlights. A dark-colored sedan drives on the left side of the road, while other cars, including yellow taxi cabs, are visible further down the street. A large, dark vehicle, possibly a truck, is positioned in the right foreground. In the center of the street, a light-colored, possibly silver, helicopter is seen tumbling through the air. This helicopter then crashes onto the pavement, resulting in a large, fiery explosion with bright orange flames, flying sparks, and dark smoke.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective on a wide city street at night, the view is framed by towering, multi-story buildings with illuminated windows. Ornate, multi-bulb streetlights line the sidewalks, casting a warm glow on the dark asphalt road, which is marked with yellow double lines and the word \"ONLY\" painted in large white letters, accompanied by a white left turn arrow. In the distance, a helicopter tumbles through the air above the street before crashing down, erupting in a fiery explosion of sparks and debris. Other vehicles, including a yellow taxi and a dark sedan, are positioned along the sides of the road. A portion of a large, dark vehicle is visible in the immediate right foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "From a low-angle wide shot, the scene is framed with a large, dark vehicle in the right foreground and tall buildings lining the left and right sides of a street that recedes into the background. A helicopter is initially visible in the center background, tumbling downwards. As the camera moves forward at street level, the helicopter descends into the middle ground. It then crashes in the center of the street, where a fiery explosion erupts, expanding outwards from the middle ground. By the end of the shot, the camera is closer to the action, positioning the explosion at its level in the middle ground, with road markings visible in the immediate foreground.",
