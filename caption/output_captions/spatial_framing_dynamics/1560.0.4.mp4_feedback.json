    "pre_caption": "The video presents a static, text-based design centered on a plain black background. The primary text, \"FREE EPISODE FROM MY HYPERLAPSE COURSE,\" is displayed in uppercase, bold, black letters on a red rectangular background, positioned centrally in the middle ground. Below this, the secondary text, \"EQUIPMENT & SHOOTING,\" appears in white, uppercase letters, also centered in the middle ground. Both text elements remain fixed throughout the video, with no movement or change in position. There are no other subjects or elements present, ensuring the viewer's focus remains solely on the text. The camera's height relative to the subject is irrelevant due to the absence of physical objects or characters. The overall composition maintains a consistent, minimalist aesthetic with a clear emphasis on the textual content.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a bold, text-based design with a focus on typography. The central text reads \"FREE EPISODE FROM MY HYPERLAPSE COURSE\" in uppercase, bold, black letters on a red background, followed by \"EQUIPMENT & SHOOTING\" in white, uppercase letters. The overall background is solid black, creating a striking contrast that emphasizes the message. The layout is clean and straightforward, with the red background drawing immediate attention to the black text, while the white text provides additional context.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video features an overlay with text centered on a plain black background. The text is bold and prominent, with \"FREE EPISODE FROM MY HYPERLAPSE COURSE\" in black on a red background and \"EQUIPMENT & SHOOTING\" in white. The setting is minimalistic, with no additional visual elements or environmental details, maintaining a focus on the text overlay. The overall style is straightforward and modern, emphasizing clarity and directness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
