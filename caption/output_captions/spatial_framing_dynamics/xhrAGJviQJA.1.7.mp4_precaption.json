    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An East Asian man with short, dark hair and a broad smile wears a white t-shirt. He is carrying a young East Asian girl on his shoulders. The girl, who has dark, shoulder-length hair with bangs and is dressed in a light-colored sleeveless top and black trousers, also smiles joyfully with her arms outstretched as she looks up.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed, captures an outdoor scene on a sunny day. Overhead, long, colorful fabric banners in shades of red, pink, yellow, white, and purple are strung in rows, fluttering in the wind against a blue sky with a few white clouds. A man is visible from the chest up, looking upward, while a young girl sits on his shoulders with her arms outstretched towards the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium shot, filmed from a low, subject-level angle in a selfie point-of-view, frames a man and a young girl. The man is positioned in the bottom center of the frame in the foreground. The girl, sitting on his shoulders, is located in the center of the frame, also in the foreground, with her arms outstretched. In the middle ground, colorful fabric banners hang overhead, filling the upper portion of the frame from left to right. The sky and clouds are visible in the background between the fluttering banners.",
