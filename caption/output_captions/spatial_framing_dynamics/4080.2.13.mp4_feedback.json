    "pre_caption": "In an extreme close-up shot, a person's face is framed in profile on the right side of the screen. The subject is positioned in the middle ground, with a dark, out-of-focus element in the foreground obscuring the bottom portion of the frame. A diffuse blue light occupies the background. The camera remains static at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with a light-to-medium skin tone is depicted in an extreme close-up, soft-focus profile view, facing toward the right. The shot highlights their eye, which has long eyelashes, and a small, dark, teardrop-shaped tattoo on their cheek just below the eye. Their features are partially obscured by shadow and a shallow depth of field, creating a hazy and atmospheric quality, with warm light on their face contrasting with a cool, blue-toned background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A very close-up, softly focused view shows a person's face in profile, mostly cast in shadow. The background is a diffuse, out-of-focus field of blue-green light. The side of a nose and an eye with visible lashes are partially illuminated, while a dark, blurry shape occupies the foreground, obscuring the lower part of the face. A small, dark mark is present on the person's cheek. The shallow depth of field creates a hazy and indistinct quality throughout the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
