    "pre_caption": "This video begins with a wide shot from an elevated angle, showing a group of hockey players celebrating in the center-left of the frame in the middle ground. The rink boards and ice occupy the foreground and bottom of the frame, while spectators are visible in the background behind the glass. The camera slowly zooms in, transitioning to a medium shot that focuses more tightly on the players. An opposing player in a white jersey, initially on the right, skates out of the frame. The celebrating group is then joined by a teammate who skates in from the right foreground. A referee, initially on the left, moves to the right side of the huddle. By the end, the celebrating players are centrally framed, with the referee positioned to their right in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of hockey players in dark blue jerseys with red and white trim, red pants, and dark blue helmets celebrates on the ice. The players, including one with the number 27 and another with the number 9, gather in a group hug near the boards, patting each other on the back. Another teammate, wearing number 25, skates in from the right to join the celebration. An opposing player in a white and gold uniform skates away from the group. A referee in a black and white striped shirt and a black helmet is positioned near the celebrating players. Behind the protective glass, a crowd of spectators, consisting of men and women in casual clothing, watches from tiered seating. One man in the crowd wears a grey sweatshirt with the word \"PENGUINS\" on the front.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor ice hockey arena provides the setting for a group celebration in a corner of the rink. The players are on a white ice surface, enclosed by white dasher boards and tall, clear protective glass. The boards are marked with advertisements, including a prominent green \"Jeep\" logo. A group of hockey players wearing dark blue jerseys with red and white trim are gathered in a huddle, raising their sticks in the air. Another player in a light-colored jersey and a referee in a black-and-white striped uniform are also on the ice. In the background, spectators are visible watching from their seats in the stands behind the glass.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of a group of hockey players celebrating near the rink boards, with a crowd of spectators visible in the background. As the camera slowly zooms in, the focus shifts to the players, tightening the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
