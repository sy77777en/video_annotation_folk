    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a landscape scenery shot of a serene, sunlit park centered around a religious monument. The focus is on the overall environment and tranquil atmosphere rather than a specific subject, allowing the viewer to take in the entire composition. A brick-paved path leads the eye through lush tropical foliage, including prominent palm trees, towards a manicured circular lawn. In the center of the lawn lies a large floral clock with dark, distinct hands. In the background, elevated on a small hill and framed by dense green trees, stands a tall, white stupa with a pointed, multi-tiered spire, set against a bright blue sky with scattered clouds. A few people can be seen strolling near the clock, adding a sense of scale to the peaceful setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-moving shot travels along a reddish-brown brick path through a lush, green park on a sunny day. The path leads towards a grassy, manicured slope featuring a large, decorative clock with dark hands set into the lawn. In the background, atop a small hill and framed by numerous trees, stands a white, multi-tiered stupa with a pointed spire. The park is filled with tropical foliage, including tall palm trees, and features smaller stone monuments and woven sculptures along the sides of the walkway. A few people are gathered on the grass near the base of the clock feature.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of a park, captured from a low camera angle. Initially, a brick path begins in the bottom-center foreground, leading toward a circular lawn with a large clock in the middle ground. This central lawn is flanked by lush trees and foliage on the left and right. In the background, a white stupa stands on an elevated, central hill. The camera then moves forward and pans slightly to the right, causing the brick path to expand and fill more of the foreground. As this happens, a stone monument becomes prominent in the right foreground, and the people near the clock in the middle ground become more clearly visible. The stupa in the background remains centrally located but is increasingly framed by tree branches entering from the top of the shot.",
