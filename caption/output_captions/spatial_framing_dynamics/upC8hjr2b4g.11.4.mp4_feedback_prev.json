    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a mannequin-like figure seated on a chair. The figure occupies the center of the frame, positioned slightly towards the right side from the camera's perspective. In 2D terms, the figure is centered horizontally but shifted slightly right, while in 3D, it is in the foreground. The camera is at the subject's level, capturing the entire figure from head to toe. To the right of the figure, a large screen is mounted on the wall, located in the upper right quadrant of the frame and in the background. A wooden table is situated behind the figure, in the middle ground, and slightly to the left. It is positioned centrally in the horizontal axis but further back in the scene. Behind the table, a large cabinet with a reflective surface is placed against the back wall, occupying the upper middle portion of the frame and forming part of the background. The tiled floor spans the entire bottom of the frame, providing a consistent base for all elements. There are no changes in shot size or spatial position throughout the video; the scene remains static. The watermark \"[26]\" is visible in the bottom left corner, outside the main action area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a mannequin-like figure seated on a chair in a dimly lit room. The camera is positioned to the left of the figure, which is slightly turned towards its right side. The figure has a smooth, white surface with geometric contours, resembling a stylized human form. Its hands rest on its lap, and it is dressed in a two-toned outfit, combining dark and light shades that accentuate its angular design. The room contains a wooden table in the background and a large cabinet with a reflective surface, adding depth to the scene. The lighting creates stark contrasts, highlighting the figure's distinct features and the minimalist setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a minimalist, dimly lit room. The environment features a tiled floor and a simple, uncluttered layout. A mannequin-like figure is seated on a chair in the center, facing a large screen on the right wall. The room includes a wooden table with a reflective surface and a cabinet in the background. The lighting is cool and focused, casting shadows and highlighting the figure's geometric form. The atmosphere is quiet and still, with no visible movement or changes. Overlay elements include a small, unobtrusive watermark marked as \"[26]\" in the lower left corner, which is not part of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
