    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man with medium-length hair styled in small braids is seen as a silhouette sitting in front of an intensely bright, white light source that creates a significant flare and rotates clockwise while emitting light. In front of the man is a black projector, which casts a focused, greenish-yellow beam of light toward the left. Above the central bright light, another light fixture with dangling wires hangs from the ceiling.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, bare room with a grainy, greenish-yellow color cast, a powerful, bright white light dominates the center of the scene. This light originates from a device on a stand, from which a focused beam of greenish-yellow light also projects across the room to the left. A person is silhouetted by the intense central glow, positioned next to the device. Thin wires hang from the ceiling above, and as the camera zooms out, computer screen borders become visible at the edges, revealing that the video is a screen recording.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a person's silhouette is positioned in the center-right of the frame in the middle ground. Immediately to their left, an intensely bright light source in the center of the frame rotates clockwise. In front of these elements, a projector sits in the bottom-center of the frame, casting a focused, greenish-yellow beam of light from the middle ground toward the left background. In the background, a light fixture with dangling wires hangs from the top-center of the ceiling, and a rectangular shape is visible against the far-left wall. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level.",
