    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a woman as a black silhouette. As the light turns on, she is revealed to have a medium skin tone, standing facing forward. She wears a bright pink dress with prominent, ruffled short sleeves and a blue turban that covers most of her dark hair, with some visible at the front. She has dark eye makeup, red lipstick, and large gold hoop earrings. Her arms are extended out to her sides, palms facing down, with her fingers slightly spread, and her head is slightly tilted.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, likely on a stage, where a figure initially appears as a black silhouette against a deep purple backdrop. As the light intensifies, the details of a woman in pink clothing become visible, creating a striking contrast. Behind her, in the center of the background, a distinct pink-purple circular spotlight adds to the theatrical and moody atmosphere, with the strong, singular color dominating the visual field.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a woman who is centrally positioned in the frame and occupies the middle ground. Her arms are extended outwards to her sides. In the background, a circular spotlight is centered behind her, set against a purple backdrop that fills the entire frame. The framing remains static throughout the clip, with no changes in shot size or the subject's position. The camera is at the subject's level.",
