    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle full shot of a surfer kneeling in the center foreground, with the yellow nose of the surfboard visible at the bottom of the frame. As the surfer rises to a standing position, they remain centrally framed, and the shot continues to capture their entire figure, with their lower half appearing larger due to the camera's position at their level. The translucent, turquoise wall of the wave occupies the right and top of the frame in the middle ground, creating a tube around the subject. In the top-left background, the bright, sunlit opening of the wave's barrel is visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a low-angle, point-of-view perspective, a man with a dark complexion surfs inside a wave. He wears a black, short-sleeved wetsuit and black shorts. Initially, he is in a kneeling position on his orange and red surfboard, which has a yellow nose. He then rises to a standing position, leaning back with his arms outstretched to his sides for balance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a surfboard captures the view from inside the barrel of a large ocean wave during the daytime. The water forms a hollow, turquoise-green tube, with the bright sun visible through the thin, translucent ceiling of the wave, creating a bright white glow. The lip of the wave is a churning mass of white foam, and water droplets spray through the air. A surfer in a black wetsuit rides on the yellow nose of the board, silhouetted against the bright light from above.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of a surfer with one knee on the surfboard. As the surfer gradually stands up, the camera continues to capture their entire figure. Due to the low angle of the camera and the surfer leaning backward, their lower half appears larger than the upper half.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
