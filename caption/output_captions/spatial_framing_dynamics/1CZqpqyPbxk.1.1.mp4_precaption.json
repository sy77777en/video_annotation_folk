    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a screen recording of an image editing app interface, showcasing the editing process of a photograph. The image being edited features a person with short hair, viewed in profile, holding a camera close to their face. The person appears to be concentrating on taking a photograph, with their head slightly tilted forward. The camera is held with both hands, and the person's facial features are partially visible due to the lighting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a recording of a computer screen with visible UI elements, likely from video editing software. The interface includes various controls and color grading tools, such as color wheels and scopes, displayed prominently at the bottom. The main section features a video clip with a green tint, possibly night vision, showing a person holding a camera. The software interface provides a structured and technical setting. The overall color scheme is dark, with the green-tinted video clip contrasting against the darker interface. The screen's brightness and the software's dark theme suggest a focus on clarity and detail.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video displays a static screen recording of a video editing software interface. The central area of the frame contains a video clip with a green tint, showing a person holding a camera in profile view. This person is positioned slightly off-center towards the left side of the frame, in the foreground. The camera they hold is also in the foreground, close to their face. The editing software's interface surrounds the video clip, with various controls and tools occupying the top, bottom, and sides of the screen. The color wheels and scopes are located at the bottom, while the timeline and playback controls are situated along the top and bottom edges. There are no changes in the spatial positioning or movement of the elements within the frame throughout the video. The camera angle remains fixed, providing a direct view of the software interface and the video clip being edited. The camera's height relative to the subject cannot be determined from this screen recording.",
