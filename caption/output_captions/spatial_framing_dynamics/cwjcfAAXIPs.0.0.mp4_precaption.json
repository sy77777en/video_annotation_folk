    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing an aerial view of a city at sunrise, almost completely enveloped in a thick, rolling sea of fog. The low sun on the horizon bathes the scene in a warm, golden light, illuminating the tops of the clouds. Only the highest points of the city are visible, including a distinctive white church perched on a hill to the right and the silhouettes of other buildings and distant hills in the background. There is no main subject in this shot; the focus is instead on the grand, ethereal atmosphere created by the vast blanket of fog and the soft morning light, emphasizing the scale and mood of the environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of a city at sunrise, enveloped in a dense layer of white fog. The thick fog fills the valley like a sea of clouds, obscuring most of the urban landscape below. On a hill to the right, a white church with a dark roof stands prominently above the mist. In the background, the sun is a bright orb just above the horizon, casting a golden glow over distant hills and the top of the cloud-like fog. Parts of the city are visible in the distance and on the left, emerging from the low-lying clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static extreme wide shot of a cityscape at sunrise, with the camera positioned at a high angle. The scene is primarily a scenery shot focused on the environment. A dense layer of fog fills the lower two-thirds of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. In the middle ground, a white church is positioned on the right, emerging from the fog. On the far left, parts of the city are also visible above the fog. In the background, the sun is located in the top center, just above the horizon line formed by distant hills.",
