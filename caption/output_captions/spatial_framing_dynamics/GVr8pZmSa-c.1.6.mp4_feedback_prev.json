    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot features a smaller, cylindrical rod positioned in the bottom center foreground. Dominating the middle ground and extending across most of the frame from bottom to top is a large, cylindrical, metallic structure. As the viewpoint moves upwards along this larger structure, its surface details appear to scroll downwards within the frame. A blurred, textured blue and white surface occupies the background at the top of the frame, also exhibiting a downward scrolling motion relative to the camera. Lacking background information makes it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up, low-angle perspective reveals a large, cylindrical, metallic structure. Its surface is characterized by numerous small, raised, rectangular elements arranged in intricate rows and patterns, alongside horizontal bands featuring repeating square indentations. The metal appears silvery-white and reflective, with some areas exhibiting a weathered or slightly corroded texture. Positioned vertically in the foreground is a smaller, silvery-white cylindrical rod with a rough, somewhat corroded metallic surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to an object, keeps its perspective fixed, revealing a close-up view of a large, metallic, cylindrical structure. This silver metallic structure features multiple horizontal bands and rows of small, raised rectangular elements. In the immediate foreground, a silver-white cylindrical rod is prominent, with shadows cast upon it. The background consists of a blurred, textured surface of blue and white, suggesting a rough wall or an icy formation, as the viewpoint appears to travel along the larger metallic object.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Lacking background information makes it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
