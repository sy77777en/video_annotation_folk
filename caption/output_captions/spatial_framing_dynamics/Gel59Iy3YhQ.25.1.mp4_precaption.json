    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black-and-white, pixelated scene, a small character resembling a ninja is depicted wearing a dark headband. This figure is positioned near several other characters who appear to be SWAT officers, identifiable by their dark, bulky tactical gear and helmets. Also present are two armored trucks, rendered in the same pixelated style, with the word \"SWAT\" written in white capital letters on their sides. Scattered across the ground are several SWAT officers who have fallen during a battle with the ninja. In the center of the image, there's also a character with light-colored hair and twintails, floating in the air with a flying device on their back.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a monochromatic, pixel-art depiction of a dense, urban street. The midground features a brick wall with a large, central metal gate bearing Cyrillic text. Behind this wall, multi-story buildings with East Asian-style roofs and numerous signs, also in Cyrillic, create a crowded cityscape. Two armored SWAT trucks are parked on either side of the gate, and a small food stall with a noodle bowl icon is visible on the right. Throughout the clip, small, pixelated characters move quickly across the scene. One character is floating along the top of the wall with a flying vehicle on his back, while other characters, including ninjas and many special police officers, engage in combat on the ground, creating white motion effects. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"PRESS TO EJECT\" next to a controller button icon.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a side-view perspective, level with the action on the ground. Initially, a large metal gate occupies the center midground, set within a brick wall that stretches across the frame. In the foreground, a SWAT truck is parked on the bottom left, while a crouched ninja and a standing SWAT officer are on the bottom right. As the scene progresses, a character with a flying device on their back appears on the top left and moves horizontally to the right along the top of the wall. Simultaneously, a second SWAT truck enters from the right and parks in the foreground. The ninja and multiple SWAT officers converge in the foreground, with the ninja character leaping and moving left while engaging in combat, creating white, pixelated motion effects across the lower portion of the frame. A text overlay remains fixed in the bottom right corner.",
