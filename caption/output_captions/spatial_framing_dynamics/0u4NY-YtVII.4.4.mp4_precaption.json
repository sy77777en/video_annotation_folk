    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a world map with various regions highlighted. Initially, several locations across North America and South America are marked with blue squares. A yellow curved line then appears, directly connecting a point in Europe to Uruguay, crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The focus shifts to Uruguay, where the country is distinctly highlighted in light blue and labeled with white text. This sequence suggests a journey or connection between Europe and Uruguay. The map's design uses dark tones for continents, drawing attention to the specified regions and routes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases a world map with a minimalist design, highlighting geographical locations. Initially, the map displays the Americas, Europe, and Africa, with a light gray background and continents in dark gray. Country borders are outlined with light gray lines for contrast. The map then transitions to a closer view of South America, specifically zooming in on Uruguay, highlighted in a distinct blue shade. An orange line originates from Europe and connects to Uruguay, indicating a path or connection. Overlay elements include text labels identifying \"Uruguay\" and a copyright notice in the lower-left corner, which reads: \"[17] ; \u00a9 OpenStreetMap contributors \u00a9 CARTO.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide-angle view of a world map, featuring continents in dark gray against a lighter gray background. Various locations in North America and South America are initially marked with blue squares in the top left and bottom left areas of the screen. These markers are positioned in the foreground, drawing immediate attention. As the video progresses, a yellow curved line emerges from the middle right section of the map, originating from Europe and extending across the Atlantic Ocean towards South America. This line is prominently displayed in the middle ground, creating a visual connection between the two continents. The camera then transitions smoothly, focusing on Uruguay, located in the bottom left area of the frame. Uruguay is highlighted in light blue and labeled with white text, now occupying the central foreground. The surrounding countries remain in dark gray, forming the background. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a top-down perspective, providing a clear overview of the geographical connections and transitions. The copyright notice remains consistently in the lower-left corner throughout the sequence.",
