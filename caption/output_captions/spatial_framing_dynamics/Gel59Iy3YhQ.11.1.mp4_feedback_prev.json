    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot from a side-view perspective, a cartoon boy stands on a central wooden platform in the middle ground. Additional wooden platforms are located in the top left of the middle ground and across the bottom of the frame in the foreground. In the top center, a wooden barrel hangs in the middle ground, while two flag icons are overlaid in the top left corner. The boy, trailed by a transparent motion-blur afterimage, jumps from the central platform to the left, landing on the bottom platform. As he moves, the camera pans left to follow him, causing the central platform and the hanging barrel to shift toward the right side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A cartoon boy with brown, spiky hair, a grey shirt, and dark pants is shown in two distinct states. In both states, he remains a solid figure. In one state, he walks forward, while in the other, he appears with a transparent, grey, and blurred afterimage due to fast-paced motion blur. The scene also features wooden platforms and ladders, some decorated with green vines. A wooden barrel hangs from a rope, and a small, square icon displaying a white, bird-like silhouette is present. In the top left corner, two white, flag-shaped icons are visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is an outdoor, jungle-like canyon with a brightly lit, hazy yellow background rendered in a painted style. The environment consists of multiple levels of wooden platforms constructed from brown logs and adorned with green vines. Some platforms have blue, watery interiors visible through slats, and they are connected by green, vine-like ladders. In the foreground, the ground below the platforms is covered with green ferns and spikes. A wooden barrel hangs from a rope in the upper portion of the scene. An overlay in the top-left corner displays two white, flag-shaped icons.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
