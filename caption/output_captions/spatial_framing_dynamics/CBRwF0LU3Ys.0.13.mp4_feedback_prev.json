    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, the scene is framed from a low, tilted angle, with the horizon running diagonally from the top left to the bottom right. A massive sand dune dominates the foreground and right side of the frame. In the middle ground, two small groups of dark figures are positioned along the crest of a distant dune, one group slightly left of center and the other further to the right. The bright, hazy sun occupies the top left background. The camera moves forward and slightly upward, gliding along the side of the foreground dune while maintaining its tilted perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two groups of small, dark figures, appearing to be a mix of people and camels, are visible in the distance. They are positioned along the crest of a vast sand dune, appearing as silhouettes against the bright, hazy sky. Due to the significant distance and atmospheric conditions, no individual details such as clothing or specific actions can be discerned.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a swift, varying tilted flight across a vast desert. The landscape is composed of immense, rolling sand dunes with sharp ridges and smooth, golden-brown slopes. The sun is a bright, hazy orb in a pale yellow sky, illuminating the scene with a warm, diffused light. In the distance, two groups of small, dark figures consisting of people and camels can be seen traversing the sand plain. The camera's low, fast movement along the side of a dune creates a dynamic perspective of the expansive, arid environment.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
