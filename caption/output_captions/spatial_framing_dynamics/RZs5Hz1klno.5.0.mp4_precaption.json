    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with a slender build is seen from behind as she walks away from the camera. She is wearing a form-fitting, all-black outfit composed of a long-sleeved top and pants. Her hair is pulled back, and both her hair and the visible skin on her head and hands have a reflective, metallic, silver-like appearance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a modern, minimalist indoor corridor, a figure dressed in black walks away from the camera. To the left, multiple rows of empty seats with brown upholstery and metallic frames are arranged in lines. The polished floor reflects the surroundings. The ceiling consists of grey, perforated tiles, from which long, rectangular light fixtures cast a glow. A smooth, unadorned wall extends along the right side of the hallway, creating a long, narrow space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a woman-like figure positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. To her left, rows of empty seats extend from the foreground into the middle ground, while a plain wall occupies the right side of the frame. The figure walks directly away from the camera, maintaining her central position as she moves deeper into the background. As she recedes, the framing transitions from a full shot to a wide shot. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
