    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black-and-white video, a man wearing a dark suit or overcoat walks along the ridge of a snow-covered hill. He then tumbles and slides rapidly down the steep, snowy slope, becoming a smaller figure against the vast incline.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stark, black-and-white outdoor scene, a person in dark clothing walks along the ridge of a large, snow-covered hill under a flat, white, overcast sky. The hill's steep slope is dotted with sparse, dark bushes poking through the snow. As the person moves, they begin to slide and tumble down the incline. The camera pans right and tilts downward, following their descent. In the middleground to background, a hazy, flat expanse is visible, with faint outlines of trees dotting the landscape. The entire scene is captured with a grainy texture.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a man is initially positioned in the upper center of the frame, walking along the ridge of a snow-covered hill in the middle ground. The camera is positioned below him, looking up. As the man begins to tumble and slide diagonally down the slope toward the bottom right, the camera pans right and tilts downward to follow his descent. During this movement, the man becomes a smaller figure in the lower-center of the frame, and the camera's perspective shifts to being above him. A hazy, flat landscape appears in the background in the upper right portion of the frame as the camera tilts.",
