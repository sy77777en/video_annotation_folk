    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man trapped in the ceiling, visible from mid-thigh to below the chest. He is wearing a white shirt, a blue striped tie, and dark pants, and is holding a notebook in his right hand. The camera captures this scene from a third-person over-the-shoulder perspective, positioned behind another person whose head is partially visible in the lower right corner. The focus remains on the man in the ceiling, emphasizing his unusual position and attire.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a focus on a ceiling where a person is partially embedded, creating a striking visual element. The ceiling is light-colored, with visible cracks radiating from the point of impact, suggesting a forceful collision. The person is wearing a white shirt and a striped tie, with their lower body visible and their head obscured by the ceiling. The scene is lit with natural lighting, indicating a daytime environment. The overall atmosphere is static, with no visible movement or changes in the environment. The setting is minimalistic, emphasizing the unusual and dramatic interaction between the person and the ceiling.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video shows a person's upper body, from the chest up, trapped in the ceiling. The camera is positioned in a third-person over-the-shoulder view, shooting from the left behind of another person. Only a small portion of the person\u2019s body and head are visible in the frame. The focus is on the person trapped in the ceiling, who is wearing a blue tie and holding a notebook in his right hand. His body is visible from the mid-thigh up to below the chest.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a medium shot focusing on a person trapped in a ceiling, visible from mid-thigh to below the chest. The subject occupies the center of the frame, with their torso and arms extending outward. The person is positioned in the middle ground, with the ceiling forming the immediate background. The camera angle is from a third-person over-the-shoulder perspective, situated slightly below the subject's height, capturing the scene from behind another individual whose head is partially visible in the bottom right corner of the frame. This secondary figure is in the foreground, adding depth to the scene. The ceiling, featuring cracks radiating from the point of impact, is located directly above the subject, emphasizing the unusual situation. Throughout the video, there are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning; the focus remains consistently on the subject's unusual placement in the ceiling, maintaining the same framing and perspective. The camera remains stationary, ensuring the subject stays centered while highlighting the static nature of the scene.",
