    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, the scene is viewed through a dark window frame in the foreground that segments the view. In the middle ground, an animated mouse stands on its hind legs in the center of the frame on a windowsill, holding a toothpick and shifting its upper body from side to side. A bowl of olives is positioned to the left of the mouse, and a coupe glass is to its right, both also in the middle ground on the sill. In the out-of-focus background, a bed occupies the central and right portions of the inner frame, while a vase of flowers is partially visible in the top left. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated brown mouse with large pink ears and a long tail stands on its hind legs. The anthropomorphic mouse holds a thin, pointed wooden stick, resembling a toothpick, in its paws. To the left of the mouse is a small bowl containing green olives, and to its right is a glass coupe containing a transparent liquid.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a softly lit room, viewed through a dark, rectangular frame composed of a windowsill and window frames that segment the space. In the out-of-focus background, a bed with white linens and a green blanket is visible. On a light-colored countertop in the background, between the bed and the windowsill, a green vase with white flowers is partially visible. A small bowl of green olives and a coupe-style cocktail glass with liquid are on the windowsill. An animated brown mouse, holding a toothpick, is composited into the live-action scene, standing on the windowsill between the olives and the glass.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
