    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a red diabolo, prominently positioned in the foreground and center of the frame. The diabolo is suspended by orange strings, which extend upwards out of the frame, indicating the presence of a person manipulating it, though only part of their leg is visible on the right side of the frame. The diabolo remains in the same 2D position throughout the video, centrally located and occupying most of the frame. Its 3D position is in the foreground, sharply focused against a blurred background of green foliage. As the video progresses, blue paint splatters dynamically onto the diabolo, spreading across its surface while the strings remain taut. The camera maintains a consistent height relative to the diabolo, capturing its movement and the paint interaction without any noticeable changes in shot size or angle. The background remains a constant, out-of-focus green, providing a natural backdrop that contrasts with the vivid red and blue of the diabolo.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large, red diabolo with a smooth, rounded shape and a central axle, suspended by orange strings. Initially, the diabolo already has some blue paint on its surface, creating an interesting visual contrast with the red. As the video progresses, more blue paint is splattered onto the diabolo, enhancing the striking contrast. The paint appears thick and glossy, partially covering the diabolo and adding a dynamic visual element. The strings remain taut, indicating the diabolo is in motion or being manipulated. The focus is on the interaction between the paint and the diabolo, highlighting the vivid colors and textures.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting with a focus on a vibrant red diabolo spinning in mid-air. The background features a blurred, lush green environment, suggesting a natural, possibly park-like area. The diabolo is suspended by strings, and its smooth, rounded shape is highlighted against the greenery. In the progression of the video, blue paint splatters across the diabolo, creating a dynamic contrast with its red surface. The scene is well-lit, indicating daytime, and the paint's motion adds a sense of energy and change to the otherwise static surroundings.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",
