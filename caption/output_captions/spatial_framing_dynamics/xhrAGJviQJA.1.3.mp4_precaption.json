    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man is seen from a level-angle perspective while underwater, silhouetted against a bright opening to the surface from within a dark, narrow space that appears to be a cave. He is shirtless and has a muscular build. He is equipped for freediving or snorkeling, wearing a mask over his face and a snorkel tube extending upwards. Both fins alternately appear behind his head. He holds a long pole, likely a selfie stick, with both hands, pointing it towards the camera. A watch is visible on his left wrist.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The camera is positioned in front of a person inside a dark, underwater cave, looking towards them. The rough, dark rock walls of the cave create a silhouette around the bright opening behind, where the water is a brilliant blue. Sunlight streams down through the water from this opening. The person, holding the camera on a pole, is also in silhouette as they move further into the cave. Two swim fins alternately appear behind their head.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In this wide shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, silhouetted by a bright opening to the surface in the background. The dark, rough walls of an underwater cave occupy the foreground and middle ground, framing the man and the opening from all sides. A pole extends from the man in the center towards the camera in the foreground, occupying the bottom center of the frame. The camera is positioned at the man's level. Throughout the shot, the man moves backward, deeper into the cave and away from the opening, causing the opening to recede and appear smaller while he remains centered in the frame.",
