    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens in a conference room setting, showcasing two sleek, modern 3D models of buildings in blue, prominently positioned in the foreground. As the camera shifts focus, these models become blurred, and attention turns to a man in the background. He stands with his back to the camera, facing a board with two building drawings. Dressed in a dark suit, with short gray hair, he appears to be examining the drawings closely, with one hand on his hip in a thoughtful pose. As the camera slowly moves forward, the model buildings gradually exit the frame, leaving only a small portion visible on the left side at the end.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting, likely an office or conference room, with a focus on a man standing in front of a large whiteboard displaying architectural blueprints. The room has a central light source, creating a contrast between the well-lit center and the darker edges, which does not fully convey a daytime setting. The whiteboard features detailed drawings of building designs, including floor plans and elevations. In the foreground, there are two holographic models of buildings, rendered in a translucent blue material with a smooth texture, adding a modern, technological element to the scene. The man, dressed in a suit, is positioned centrally, facing the whiteboard, suggesting he is analyzing or presenting the designs. The environment is minimalistic, with a focus on the architectural elements. Overlay elements include text and icons at the bottom of the video, providing additional information or context, but they are not part of the physical scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a conference room, starting with a focus on two 3D models resembling buildings, with a man blurred in the background. The camera then moves forward, shifting focus to the man standing with his back to the camera, facing a board with two building drawings. Only his upper body is visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot focusing on two 3D building models in the foreground, positioned on the left and right sides of the frame. These models occupy the foreground, while a man in a dark suit stands in the background, centered horizontally and slightly towards the middle ground. Initially, the man is out of focus, with only his upper body visible. As the camera moves forward, the shot transitions from a medium to a closer medium shot, bringing the man into clearer view. The 3D models gradually blur and shift out of the frame, with only a small portion remaining visible on the left side by the end. The man remains in the center of the frame throughout, facing a whiteboard with building drawings. The camera maintains a level height relative to the man, capturing him from behind as he examines the drawings. The whiteboard is positioned directly in front of the man, occupying the background space. The overall spatial dynamics emphasize the transition from the models in the foreground to the man and the drawings in the background, highlighting the shift in focus through the camera movement.",
