    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a cityscape scenery shot captured from the point of view of a fast-moving train. The perspective looks forward along a set of tracks that converge in the distance, flanked by tall urban buildings that are heavily distorted by motion blur, creating streaks of light and color. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the dynamic sensation of speed and the immersive atmosphere of traveling through a dense city rather than on any specific object or landmark.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From the perspective of a fast-moving train, the scene captures a forward view along a set of elevated tracks cutting through a dense urban environment. The metallic rails recede into the center of the view, leading toward more distant city buildings under an overcast sky. On either side, multi-story buildings are streaked into a significant motion blur, indicating high speed.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from a forward-facing, point-of-view perspective. In the foreground and middle ground, a set of train tracks begins at the bottom of the frame and extends toward the center, creating strong leading lines. On the left and right sides, middle-ground urban buildings are heavily blurred, appearing as horizontal streaks. In the background, more distant city buildings are positioned in the center of the frame, at the vanishing point of the tracks, with an overcast sky visible at the top. The camera is positioned at an elevated height, as if on an overground train, and moves rapidly forward, causing the radial motion blur that affects the elements on the periphery of the frame while the central background remains clearer.",
