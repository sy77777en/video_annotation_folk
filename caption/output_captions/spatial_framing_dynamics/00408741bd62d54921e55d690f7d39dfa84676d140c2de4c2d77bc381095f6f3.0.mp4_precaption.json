    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with dark skin and long, dark hair walks along a city sidewalk. She is wearing a white, sleeveless, midi-length dress with a side slit and white sneakers. In her hand, she holds a clear cup containing a green beverage with a straw, from which she takes a sip as she approaches. She continues walking until she passes the camera and exits the frame on the right. In the foreground, a light green metal cafe table and chairs are positioned on the sidewalk. In the background, a person wearing a helmet rides a red bicycle across the street, and a dark-colored SUV is parked.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a static viewpoint, the scene captures a daytime city street. In the foreground, a green metal bistro table and chairs are set on a concrete sidewalk. To the left, a reddish-brown brick building with a wooden bench and a black A-frame sign at its base lines the walkway. The sidewalk extends into the background, leading to a street with a white-painted crosswalk. Across the street, lush green trees stand in front of other buildings, with cars parked and driving along the road. A woman walks from the background toward the camera along the sidewalk, and a person on a bicycle moves across the street in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This static, eye-level video begins as a wide shot, with a woman positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right of the frame's center. In the foreground, a green cafe table and chairs occupy the bottom-left corner. A brick building extends from the foreground to the middle ground along the left edge of the frame, while the street, trees, and cars are situated in the background. The woman walks from the middle ground toward the camera, moving diagonally toward the right side of the frame. As she gets closer, the framing tightens to a medium shot before she walks past the camera and exits the frame on the right, leaving the static scenery. While she walks, a cyclist moves from left to right across the street in the background.",
