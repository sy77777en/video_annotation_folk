The focus then pulls to reveal the scene. In the final composition, dark, silhouetted leaves and branches are in the foreground, framing the top, left, and right sides of the shot, with some backlit green leaves visible in the top-left.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a nature scenery shot capturing a waterfall through the foliage of a forest. The video begins with a soft, out-of-focus view that gradually sharpens to reveal the bright, cascading water in the background, framed by the dark, silhouetted shapes of leaves and branches in the foreground. There is no single main subject because the composition emphasizes the overall atmosphere and the layered perspective of looking through the dense woods to the powerful natural feature beyond. The focus is on the environment and the feeling of discovery rather than a specific object. The interplay between the dark foreground and the bright background creates a sense of depth and makes the entire scene the subject of the shot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins with a completely blurred view of green and white shapes, which gradually comes into focus. The final view is from a level angle, looking through the foliage of trees towards a waterfall in the background. In the foreground, the dark silhouettes of leaves and thin branches hang down, with some leaves catching the light to reveal a vibrant green color. Behind the foliage, white water cascades down a dark, rocky cliff face, creating a high-contrast natural scene during the daytime.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the scenery.",
