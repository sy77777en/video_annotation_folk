    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with a serious expression stands in the center, walking forward. He wears a dark, wide-brimmed cowboy hat, a brown suit jacket over a matching vest, a white collared shirt, and a red tie. A pocket watch chain is visible across his vest, and a pistol in a holster is strapped to his right hip. In the background, a crowd of men and women dressed in late 19th-century Western attire line both sides of the street, standing and observing him. The men wear hats and suits, while the women are in long dresses, all in muted earth tones.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor scene is set in a dusty Old West town during what appears to be sunset, with a warm, golden-orange light illuminating the environment. A wide, unpaved dirt street runs through the center, flanked on both sides by two-story, weathered wooden buildings with porches. A young man wearing a dark, wide-brimmed hat and a brown suit walks down the middle of the street. In the background, groups of people in period clothing stand along the sides of the road.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a young man is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of a dusty town street. Groups of people and wooden buildings line the left and right sides of the frame, occupying the middle ground and background. The man walks directly toward the camera, moving from the middle ground into the foreground, which causes the shot to transition into a medium close-up as his upper body progressively fills the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout this movement.",
