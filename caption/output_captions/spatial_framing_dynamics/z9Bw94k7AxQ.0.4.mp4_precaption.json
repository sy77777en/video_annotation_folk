    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, captured from a low-angle perspective looking straight up from a narrow space between two towering buildings. The structures are rendered in deep, imposing silhouette against a sliver of pale, greenish-blue sky. Intricate, dark metal fire escapes and balconies cling to the sides of the buildings, creating a dense, geometric pattern that enhances the feeling of a claustrophobic urban canyon. There is no main subject; the focus is instead on conveying the overwhelming scale and oppressive atmosphere of the dense city environment, emphasizing the feeling of being dwarfed by the architecture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a worm's eye view looking straight up from a narrow urban alley, two towering buildings are cast in deep silhouette against a sliver of pale, greenish-blue sky. The dark facades of the buildings create a canyon-like enclosure. Intricate black metal fire escapes, with their platforms and railings, run up the sides of the buildings, forming a complex, cage-like pattern in the foreground. The building on the right shows a faint grid of windows, but both structures are mostly obscured by shadow. The camera tilts slowly, causing the perspective of the tall buildings to shift.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide scenery shot is captured from a low-angle, worm's-eye perspective, looking up from the bottom of the frame. Two towering buildings, rendered in silhouette, occupy the left and right sides, creating a narrow vertical gap in the center that reveals a sliver of sky in the background at the top. Dark, intricate fire escapes are positioned in the foreground and middle ground, attached to the buildings and filling the lower portion of the frame. The camera performs a slow tilt, causing the vertical lines of the buildings and the gap of sky to shift their orientation within the frame, moving from a more vertical alignment towards a slight diagonal.",
