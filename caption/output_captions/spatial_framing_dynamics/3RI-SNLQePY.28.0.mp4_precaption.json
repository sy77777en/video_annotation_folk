    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a gumball machine with a beige base and a transparent globe filled with multicolored gumballs. A metal lever is present, and a mouse icon moving in circles suggests an interactive game where the player spins the lever to release the gumballs. Among the dispensed gumballs, a unique white gumball with a brown hole is highlighted. This special gumball is enlarged and displayed prominently, indicating that the player examined it closely, before the view returns to the original scene. The focus remains on the machine and the action of dispensing the gumballs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a software or system interface displays a stylized, hand-drawn gumball machine against a solid gray background. The light pinkish-brown machine rests on a brown countertop, its glass globe holding a small collection of colorful gumballs, including one that resembles a white gumball with a brown hole. A white arrow cursor circles the machine's lever, turning the crank to release the gumballs, which fall onto the countertop. A gray triangle-shaped exit button is located in the upper left corner of the screen, and a brown collection bar is at the bottom. Within this bar, there is a small icon resembling a building collection and a brown backpack in the lower left corner of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.\n\n2D scenes can avoid the saying of front, middle and back scenes",
    "pre_caption": "The scene presents a stylized gumball machine centered on a brown countertop that spans the bottom of the frame, all against a flat gray background. In the bottom left corner, an inventory bar is visible, while an exit button sits in the top left. A white arrow cursor starts to the left of the machine's central lever, then moves to circle it, causing gumballs to fall from a dispenser at the machine's base onto the countertop. The view then cuts to a close-up, with an enlarged white gumball containing a brown hole appearing in the center of the screen, superimposed over a faded image of the gumball machine. The scene then returns to its original framing, where the special gumball now rests on the countertop to the left of the machine's base, with the cursor positioned directly over it. The camera's perspective remains fixed and at eye level with the gumball machine throughout the entire sequence.",
