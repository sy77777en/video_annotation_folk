    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a static scene. In the left foreground stands a blue toy soldier, mirrored by another in the right foreground. The middle ground, centrally illuminated by a spotlight, features two white toy figures kneeling side-by-side, one slightly left of center and the other slightly right of center. Several small, white objects are scattered on the ground in the center of the middle ground, in front of and between the kneeling figures. The surrounding background is completely black. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a dimly lit scene with a spotlight focused on the center. In the foreground, on the left, a blue toy soldier figure stands slightly turned towards the midground, wearing a helmet and tactical vest, and aiming a brown rifle towards the center. On the right, another blue toy soldier figure is similarly positioned, slightly turned towards the midground, also in a helmet and tactical vest, aiming a brown rifle towards the center. In the middle ground, two white toy figures of men are kneeling side-by-side, facing forward with their hands raised above their heads. Both kneeling figures are dressed in white suits. Several small, white, cylindrical objects are scattered on the ground in front of and between the kneeling figures.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a static scene set in a dimly lit, undefined space, where a large spotlight illuminates a flat, gray, textured ground. In the illuminated center, two small, white, matte-finished figurines of men in suits are kneeling with their hands raised, with several smaller, white, cylindrical and rectangular objects scattered near them. Flanking these central figures are two larger, blue, matte-finished figurines resembling soldiers in tactical gear and helmets, each holding a brown rifle aimed towards the kneeling white figures. The surrounding area and background are completely black. An overlay text \"[23]\" is located in the lower left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
