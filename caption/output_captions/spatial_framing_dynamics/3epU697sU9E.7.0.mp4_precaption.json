    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two sheets of white paper with handwritten notes in black ink are positioned on a light brown wooden surface. The notes on the left sheet are organized with timestamps, including \"9:43\" and \"10:20\". An overlay on the screen highlights a line of text next to the \"10:20\" timestamp, displaying the words \"I am authorized to shoot down if necessary\". The sheet on the right also contains handwritten notes with timestamps such as \"10:31\" and \"10:41\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Two sheets of white paper covered in black handwritten notes are laid out on a light brown wooden surface with a visible grain. The view slowly zooms in on the left-hand sheet of paper. As it does, a yellow highlight box, an overlay on the video, appears over a line of text that reads, \"authorized shoot down if necessary.\" A smaller yellow box also highlights the timestamp \"10:20\" written on the page.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot from an overhead perspective, showing two sheets of paper positioned side-by-side in the middle ground on a wooden surface. The left sheet is in the left-center of the frame, and the right sheet is in the right-center. The camera then slowly zooms in, transitioning to a close-up that focuses on the central portion of the left-hand sheet. As the zoom progresses, a small yellow highlight box appears over the timestamp \"10:20\" on the left side of the page, and a larger yellow box simultaneously overlays a line of text in the center of the note. The camera maintains its position above the paper throughout the shot.",
