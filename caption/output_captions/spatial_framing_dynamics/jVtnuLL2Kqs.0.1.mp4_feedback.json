    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot with no main subjects, focusing on the environment. Initially, the scene is framed through a large doorway in the foreground, looking down a long, symmetrical hallway that occupies the center of the frame and extends from the middle ground to the background. The camera, positioned at a standard height, begins to move forward down the center of the hallway. As it advances, the foreground doorway framing the shot moves out of view, revealing the full length of the corridor. The hallway is lined with doors on the left and right sides, which move from the middle ground toward the foreground and then past the camera. A bright, rectangular light source is positioned at the far end of the hall in the center of the background, serving as a constant vanishing point that grows larger as the camera moves toward it. A static logo overlay is present in the bottom right corner of the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents an atmospheric interior scenery shot, moving forward through a long, dark, and symmetrical hallway. The corridor is lined with numerous identical doors on either side, with some doors open and others closed. Slivers of light seep from beneath these doors, illuminating the hallway. The floor is dark and highly reflective, mirroring the stark contrast between the shadowy foreground and the intensely bright, white light emanating from an open doorway at the very end of the hall. The focus is entirely on the environment and the feeling it evokes, using the strong leading lines and dramatic lighting to create a sense of mystery, infinity, or passage. There is no main subject because the composition is designed to draw the viewer's eye through the space itself, making the atmosphere and the journey toward the light the central experience. The stark, monochromatic aesthetic emphasizes form and contrast over specific details, further centering the environmental mood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a forward-moving perspective down a long, symmetrical indoor hallway with a monochromatic color scheme. The corridor features a dark, polished, and reflective floor, with dimly lit, light-colored walls lined on both sides by a series of identical doors. Initially, some doors are open while others are closed, but they quickly transition between open and closed as the camera moves past them. A bright, rectangular light source at the far end of the hall creates a strong backlight, casting long shadows and creating bright highlights on the door frames. A white logo overlay is visible in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
