    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot. The historic walled city, composed of densely packed buildings, dominates the frame, extending from the bottom left, through the center, to the top left, all situated in the middle ground. Grey stone fortifications surround this city, visible in the foreground and middle ground, with a notable cylindrical tower positioned in the bottom center foreground. The deep blue sea is located in the top right background. A red structure stands in the bottom right middle ground, near green vegetated areas. Roads with vehicles are present in the bottom left and bottom right, spanning the foreground and middle ground. The camera is positioned high above, providing an aerial view of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This aerial cityscape captures the historic walled city, encircled by impressive stone walls and fortifications. The deep blue sea in the top right corner provides a striking contrast, while a red industrial structure stands out amidst a green area in the bottom right. Roads and cars are also clearly visible, highlighting the city's architectural character and vibrant environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A drone captures an aerial view of the historic walled city of Dubrovnik, Croatia, during daylight. The scene showcases a dense array of buildings with orange terracotta tiled roofs, surrounded by light-colored stone or stucco walls, all enclosed by imposing grey stone fortifications. A notable cylindrical stone tower is part of these defenses. The city is bordered by the deep blue waters of the Adriatic Sea, with green vegetation visible outside the city walls and within some courtyards. In the lower right, a prominent red structure stands out.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
