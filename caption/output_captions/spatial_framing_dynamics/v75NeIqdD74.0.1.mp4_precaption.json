    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A grey and purple futuristic jet-like aircraft is depicted. The vehicle has a sleek body with wings, a tail fin, and a transparent cockpit canopy. Magenta and pink accents adorn the wings, tail, and the area around the cockpit. The aircraft is equipped with landing gear, including wheels at the front and back. Inside the cockpit, a small brown and white dog is visible, wearing a pink helmet. Initially, there is a yellow and white dog on the runway, wearing a yellow outfit and carrying directional wands on its back.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place outdoors during the day under a clear blue sky. A futuristic, grey and purple aircraft with pink accents accelerates down a dark runway marked with yellow lines. This runway is on the deck of a massive red and grey vessel, which is moving through the water. In the background, across the water, stands a large, modern city with a dense skyline of numerous tall, sleek skyscrapers. The aircraft creates motion blur and leaves a trail of smoke as it speeds along the vessel's deck.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a grey and purple jet in the center middle ground, moving from left to right along a runway. A blurred yellow dog is briefly visible in the left foreground. The camera then pulls back, transitioning to an extreme wide shot. In the final frame, the massive red vessel and its runway dominate the scene, stretching from the bottom left foreground to the right middle ground. The jet, now a small element, continues moving rightward in the middle ground, while a large city skyline occupies the background across the top of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
