    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The camera zooms in shakily on the apartment building in the background. As it approaches, a figure gradually becomes visible behind a reddish-brown fence. The person, shirtless and wearing light-colored pants, skates from right to left, though specific details remain unclear due to the video quality.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor, daytime scene is set in an urban environment. In the foreground, a gray metal pedestrian ramp with a caged walkway angles upward. Behind the ramp, a tall, dark brown fence with a grid-like pattern stands in front of a concrete wall and white structures featuring louvered vents. A multi-story, beige apartment building with numerous windows and a smaller, reddish-brown brick building are visible in the background. The shot slowly zooms in, bringing the fence and the buildings into closer view. The scene has a muted color palette and a grainy, film-like quality.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The subject is too far from the camera, making it difficult to determine the exact camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot, showing a gray pedestrian ramp in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A dark brown fence occupies the middle ground in the center, with a large beige apartment building in the background at the top. The camera then shakily zooms in, reframing the scene into a wide shot. This zoom reveals a shirtless person in the middle ground, positioned centrally behind the fence. The person moves on a skateboard from the right side of the frame to the left, remaining behind the fence as the shot continues to zoom in on the background building.",
