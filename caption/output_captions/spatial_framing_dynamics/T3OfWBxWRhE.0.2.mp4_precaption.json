    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This cityscape scenery shot features a low-angle, upward-tilting view of a monumental church. The building is constructed from grey concrete, with a distinctive, tiered design that emulates natural rock formations, culminating in a tall, pointed spire with a clock face near its peak. To its front, a statue of a figure stands on a large pedestal.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor, daytime scene captures the Hallgr\u00edmskirkja church in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, set against a sky filled with white clouds. The view is directed upward toward the tall, tapered concrete tower, which features a distinctive stepped design of vertical columns. A clock is visible near the spire, and a series of small windows runs down the front facade. In front of the church, a dark statue of a figure is positioned on a pedestal. The shot includes a motion blur, indicating camera movement.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
    "pre_caption": "This scenery shot begins with a low-angle, extreme wide shot of a monumental church. The church's tall tower is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. In the bottom-left foreground, a statue stands on a pedestal. The camera then tilts upward while zooming in, transitioning to a wide shot. During this movement, the statue in the foreground moves out of the frame, leaving the central church tower as the sole focus, framed against the cloudy sky in the background.",
