    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, an older man is positioned on the left and a younger man is on the right, both in the middle ground. A green, pliable object is initially seen in slow motion, pressed against the right side of the younger man's face. As the action continues, the object bounces off his face and falls toward the bottom of the frame. The older man lowers his arm, and the younger man looks down to the right. The subjects remain in their respective positions on the left and right throughout the shot. The scene is set on a grassy lawn in the foreground and middle ground, with a line of trees in the background, and the camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An older man with short white hair and fair skin stands on the left, wearing a white t-shirt with an American flag design. He faces a younger, muscular man with his arms slightly bent as if pushing forward. The young man, who has brown hair and a short beard, stands on the right with his hands on his hips, wearing a red t-shirt featuring a graphic of a truck wrapped entirely in a large American flag design. A green, soft, semi-transparent object, resembling a water balloon about to burst, is pressed against the young man's right cheek, deforming upon impact. As the video resumes normal speed, the balloon slightly bounces off his face, regains its original shape, and then falls.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Set on a bright, sunny day, the scene unfolds in a spacious, grassy park. A dense wall of lush green trees lines the background, creating a natural backdrop. An older man and a younger man stand on the manicured lawn. A green, pliable object is seen deforming as it makes contact with the younger man's face.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
