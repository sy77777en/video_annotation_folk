    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins by capturing an empty room before the camera pans to the right and tilts downward, transitioning to focus on an interior architectural scenery shot of a swimming pool area. The pool, filled with rippling teal water, is partially encircled by a white spiral staircase featuring a metallic railing. The surrounding walls and floor are covered in white square tiles. A small rubber duck floats in the water, adding a playful touch to the scene. The focus is on the clean, minimalist architectural design and the serene atmosphere of the aquatic space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins in a tiled room featuring three glowing vertical windows. The walls are covered in white tiles on both the upper and lower sections, with a dark textured strip running horizontally across the middle. The scene then transitions to an indoor, brightly lit space with a white, spiral staircase featuring silver metal railings. The staircase descends towards a pool of teal-colored water at its base. The surrounding walls and floor are covered in small, white square tiles. Several white cylindrical pillars are present in the space. A small, yellow, fake duck is visible floating in the water near the edge of the pool.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of an empty tiled room, featuring three glowing vertical windows positioned in the middle ground, with the camera at eye level. The walls are covered in white tiles, with a dark horizontal strip across the center. The camera then pans right and tilts downward, transitioning to a wide shot of an indoor swimming pool area. The pool, located in the middle ground, is partially encircled by a white spiral staircase with metallic railings, positioned in the foreground and descending into the background. The teal water of the pool is visible, with a small rubber duck floating near the edge in the bottom center of the frame. The surrounding walls and floor are covered in white square tiles, and several white cylindrical pillars are present in the background. The camera maintains a high angle, looking down at the scene, emphasizing the architectural design and serene atmosphere.",
