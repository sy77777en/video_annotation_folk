    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases a 3D game scene with pool-core and dreamcore aesthetics, featuring an interior architectural view looking down into a swimming pool area. The pool, filled with rippling teal water, is partially encircled by a white spiral staircase with a metallic railing. The surrounding walls and floor are covered in white square tiles. A small rubber duck floats in the water, adding a whimsical touch. The focus is on the clean, minimalist architectural design and the serene atmosphere of the aquatic space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is an indoor 3D game environment featuring a white, spiral staircase with silver metal railings descending into a body of teal-colored water. The walls and the floor area surrounding the water are covered in small, white square tiles. White cylindrical pillars support the staircase. A small, orange rubber duck is visible in the rippling water beneath the stairs. The lighting is even and diffuse.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an indoor architectural scene. A white spiral staircase is positioned in the top right, extending towards the center of the frame in the middle ground. Teal pool water is located in the center and bottom portions of the frame, also in the middle ground. A white tiled surface covers the bottom left and extends along the bottom and left edges in the foreground. A small orange rubber duck floats near the center of the water in the middle ground. White cylindrical pillars are visible on the right side, supporting the staircase in the middle ground. A metallic railing is prominent in the foreground, running diagonally from the top left towards the bottom right. The staircase itself has a metallic railing following its curve in the middle ground. The camera maintains a static, high-angle perspective, looking down onto the scene.",
