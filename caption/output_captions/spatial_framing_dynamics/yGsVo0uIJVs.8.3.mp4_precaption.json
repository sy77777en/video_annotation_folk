    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a large, heavily damaged metallic wreck, likely a submarine or ship hull, resting on the sandy seabed underwater. The wreck is crumpled and has a bluish-green appearance in the dim, murky blue water. Positioned over the wreck is a large, white, mechanical lifting structure composed of cylindrical pipes forming legs and a horizontal platform above. This structure appears to be attempting to secure the wreck, with its legs slightly retracted and gripping the damaged hull, as if preparing for or initiating a lift. In the latter part of the video, the lifting structure is shown more fully, revealing a railed platform on top and cables extending upwards, indicating the wreck is being raised. Light filters down from the surface through the water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an underwater scene where a large, crumpled, metallic wreck, likely a submarine, rests on a sandy seabed. The water is dark and murky, with light filtering down from above. A substantial, grey, metallic lifting structure, resembling a large claw or cradle with multiple articulated arms, is positioned over and around the wreck. This structure, supported by thick vertical pillars and a horizontal platform, has secured the wreckage. Descending cables from above secure the structure before the lift begins. The entire assembly, including the wreck and the lifting mechanism, is slowly ascending through the water. An overlay text at the bottom left corner reads \"[2] ; \u00a9MapTiler.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a full shot, with the camera at the subjects' level. Initially, a large, damaged metallic wreck is positioned centrally and towards the bottom of the frame, resting on the sandy seabed in the foreground and lower middle ground. Directly above and around the wreck, the lower part of a large mechanical lifting structure is visible in the middle ground, engaging the hull. As the lift begins, the entire assembly\u2014wreck and lifting structure\u2014ascends. Consequently, the seabed recedes to the bottom of the frame and into the background. This upward movement also brings the upper portion of the lifting structure into view; its horizontal platform becomes prominent in the upper middle ground, supported by vertical pillars to the left and right, with cables extending upwards from its center towards the top of the frame. The wreck remains centrally suspended by the structure in the middle ground throughout the ascent.",
