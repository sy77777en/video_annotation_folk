    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with short, light-colored hair is seen in a kitchen. He is wearing a green hooded sweatshirt and a light-colored baseball cap. He picks up a red and silver soda can from a counter, takes a drink, leans over the counter, and then covers his mouth with both hands.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a modern kitchen, illuminated by warm, artificial light. The space is characterized by white cabinetry, marble countertops, and a large, stainless steel, double-door refrigerator. A gas stovetop is situated beneath a matching range hood, and a central island with a sink occupies the foreground. The kitchen table is cluttered with numerous utensils, adding a touch of lived-in realism to the otherwise sleek and modern aesthetic. In the background, a doorway provides a glimpse into another dimly lit room of the house.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man positioned in the center-middle ground of a kitchen. A stainless steel refrigerator is visible in the left middle ground, with white cabinetry spanning the background. A kitchen counter occupies the right foreground. As the man drinks from a can and leans forward, the camera pans slightly to the right and zooms in, reframing the scene into a medium close-up. In this tighter shot, the man remains in the center but is now closer to the foreground, while the refrigerator on the left is pushed out of the frame and a doorway in the right background becomes more prominent. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
