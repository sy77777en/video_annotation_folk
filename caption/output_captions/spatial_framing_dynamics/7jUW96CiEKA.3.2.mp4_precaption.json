    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a bird with a distinctive appearance, characterized by a gray body, white underparts, and black markings on its wings. It has a primarily yellow beak with a distinct black tip at its pointed end and long, slender legs, which are pale in color. The bird is seen standing and walking on a muddy surface, suggesting it is in a wetland or similar environment. Its posture is upright, and it appears to be foraging or exploring the area. The bird's head is turned slightly, indicating alertness or curiosity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set outdoors during the daytime under bright sunlight. The scene consists of a muddy area with uneven, thick brown mud forming mounds and depressions. Shallow puddles of murky water are scattered throughout the mud. A single lapwing, characterized by its grey and white feathers, black wing markings, long thin legs, and yellow facial features including the beak, is seen walking across this muddy terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a bird in a full shot, positioned initially in the bottom left of the frame, in the foreground. The bird is standing on a muddy surface with shallow puddles, which occupy the middle ground and background. As the video progresses, the bird moves from the left to the right side of the frame, maintaining its position in the foreground. The camera remains at the bird's level throughout, capturing its movement across the uneven terrain. The muddy environment, with its mounds and depressions, forms the backdrop, with the bird's movement creating a dynamic interaction with the scene.",
