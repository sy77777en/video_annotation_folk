    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a man is initially positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, suspended in a tucked position. A glowing visual effect surrounds him, also in the middle ground. Behind the man, a dark horizontal bar stretches across the scene. As the video plays, the man rotates slightly counter-clockwise while the camera pans to the right and appears to move slightly backward. This combined movement shifts the man's position from the center-left toward the center-right of the frame, revealing more of the room in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned, balding man, who appears to be middle-aged or older, is depicted as suspended mid-air in a tucked position, with his knees drawn up toward his torso and his arms hooked around his lower legs. He is barefoot and wears light blue striped pajamas. A glowing, fiery, orange-yellow visual effect surrounds his entire body in a roughly spherical form, appearing to spark and move around him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting with light-colored walls and flooring, a dark horizontal bar extends across the middle of the room. A person in light-colored clothing appears to be suspended in midair, adopting a tucked position with knees drawn up toward the torso and arms wrapped around the lower legs. The scene has a grainy, vintage quality with a muted, purplish color cast. A glowing orange-yellow visual effect envelops the entire body in a roughly spherical shape, while swirling, golden, fiery light effects move around the person's head and torso. Black bar overlays are present on both sides of the video, and the four corners of the frame feature a vignette effect, adding a dark overlay.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
