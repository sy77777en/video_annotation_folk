    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins a cylindrical nesting doll, predominantly white with blue and green floral patterns.  Initially, the blue nesting doll is lying down and rolls out of the frame, revealing another nesting doll behind it that is also lying down and rolling on the surface. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a minimalistic indoor setting with a plain white background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a cylindrical nesting doll, predominantly white with blue and green floral patterns, positioned in the foreground on the left side of the frame. As the video progresses, the nesting doll rolls from the left towards the right, moving out of the frame. This transition shifts the shot size to a wide view, revealing a smaller blue nesting doll in the foreground on the left side. The smaller nesting doll then rolls slowly across the frame from left to right, maintaining its position in the foreground. The background remains a plain white throughout, providing a consistent backdrop. The camera maintains a level position relative to the subjects, capturing their movements smoothly as they roll across the scene.",
