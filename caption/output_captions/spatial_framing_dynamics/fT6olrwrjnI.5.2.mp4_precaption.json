    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Four young men, drawn in an anime style, are engaged in a physical confrontation. The central figure, a young man with spiky orange hair, grits his teeth with an intense expression. He wears a red sleeveless jersey with the number \"50\" over a black long-sleeved undershirt with blue stripes on the arms and is pushing forward. To frame right, a young man with short, spiky black hair and a strained, wide-eyed expression is being pushed back. He wears a white sleeveless jersey with the number \"18\" over a matching black and blue undershirt. Prominently positioned at the front on the left side of the frame, a young man with shaggy black hair and blue eyes, dressed in a white jersey, faces forward with an open-mouthed expression. Initially located at the far left of the frame, a young man with medium-length purple hair, wearing a red jersey, moves to the background as the scene progresses.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a brightly lit, modern indoor facility, possibly a sports arena or training center. The background is dominated by a large, white, grid-like structure that forms the ceiling and upper walls, allowing ample light into the space. On what appears to be a court, four male anime characters are captured in a dynamic pose. They are dressed in athletic uniforms, consisting of either red and black or white and black jerseys over black long-sleeved shirts accented with blue lines.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This low-angle medium shot captures four young men inside a brightly lit facility. A man with orange hair is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, pushing forward. To his right, another man in a white jersey is being pushed back, also positioned in the middle ground. In the bottom-left foreground, a man with shaggy black hair is closest to the camera. A fourth man with purple hair stands on the left side of the frame, slightly behind the central figure in the middle ground. The background consists of a white, grid-like ceiling structure that occupies the top portion of the scene.",
