    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a medium close-up of a man with light skin, short dark brown hair, and light stubble, wearing a light blue denim jacket over a white t-shirt. His jacket is open as he walks towards the camera, blinking continuously. The camera pans to the right to follow his movement, gradually tightening the frame to a close-up of his head and then to an extreme close-up of his face. As the shot progresses, the man drifts out of focus, leaving only a blurred view of his neck. Initially, a fence and several buildings are visible in the background, but they disappear as the framing focuses more closely on the man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor, paved area during the day, a man in a denim jacket and white t-shirt walks forward. A tall, silver chain-link fence is positioned behind him, with out-of-focus buildings and another paved surface visible in the background. The camera moves steadily closer to the man, transitioning from a medium close-up to an extreme close-up where his face becomes completely blurred.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. In the background, a chain-link fence is visible. The man walks forward toward the camera, and as he does, the camera pans to the right and pushes in, transitioning the shot from a medium shot to a close-up and then to an extreme close-up. As the frame tightens, his face fills the screen, eventually becoming completely blurred and leaving only an out-of-focus view of his lower face and neck, which obscures the background. The camera remains at the man's level throughout the shot.",
