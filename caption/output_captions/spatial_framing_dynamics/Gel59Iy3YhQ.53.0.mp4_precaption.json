    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel art video game scene, a small character with a roughly humanoid form, dressed in a red top and blue pants, walks through the snow. The environment consists of stylized, triangular green trees and a larger, more detailed evergreen tree. The rocky canyon walls are rendered in various shades of purple. In the lower-left corner, a row of identical golden, feather-like collectibles is displayed as overlays. A small compass with a red arrow pointing north is situated in the upper-right corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video with a pixel art style, a character moves up a winding path in a snowy mountain ravine. The steep canyon walls are a textured purple, and the ground is covered in white snow, with a few green, pine-like trees scattered about. In the lower-left area, there is a frozen, light-blue body of water. White snowflakes fall continuously throughout the scene. Overlays are visible on screen: a row of nine golden, feather-like icons is in the bottom-left corner, and a small compass with a red arrow pointing north is in the top-right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle, shows a small character in the middle ground, positioned in the upper center of the frame on a winding snowy path. The path is flanked by purple canyon walls that dominate the background on the left and right. In the foreground, a large evergreen tree and a frozen body of water are located in the bottom-left quadrant. A row of golden feather icons is overlaid in the bottom-left corner, and a compass is in the top-right corner. As the character moves up the path toward the top right, the camera follows, causing the foreground elements in the bottom left to move out of the frame.",
