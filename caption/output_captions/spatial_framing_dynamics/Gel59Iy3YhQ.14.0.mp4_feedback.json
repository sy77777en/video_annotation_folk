    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a cartoonish graveyard, with the camera initially positioned above the foreground elements. A castle is visible in the background at the top center, while gnarled trees occupy the left and right foreground and middle ground. Various stone tombstones are scattered across the middle ground, with a wooden fence to the middle ground left and a faintly glowing lantern in the middle ground center-right. In the foreground, a large, upright bread-shaped tombstone stands left of center, near two smaller, flat bread slices lying on the ground\u2014one in the center-left and another in the center-right. These two foreground bread slices then animate, standing upright with glowing red eyes in their respective positions, as a third similar animated figure emerges from behind the large bread-tombstone in the left-center foreground. Simultaneously, the camera's height adjusts to be more at the level of these animated subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three objects resembling slices of light brown bread with darker crusts, some appearing whole and others partially eaten, scattered on the ground. These upright bread slices later appear animated, possessing small brown arms and legs and two glowing red eyes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This video depicts a cartoonish, spooky graveyard at night under a rainy sky. The scene is dimly lit, with gnarled, leafless trees silhouetted against a dark, cloudy backdrop where a distant castle with glowing windows sits atop a hill. The graveyard is filled with various stone and bread-shaped tombstones, some of which are broken or tilted. The ground is dark and scattered with what appears to be grass or debris. A dark wooden fence lines part of the graveyard, and a faint glow emanates from a lantern and some of the castle's windows. Rain is visibly falling throughout the scene. In the middleground, three previously lying bread-shaped objects briefly animate, with their \"eyes\" glowing red. Occasional flashes of lightning illuminate the scene, casting eerie shadows across the graveyard.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
