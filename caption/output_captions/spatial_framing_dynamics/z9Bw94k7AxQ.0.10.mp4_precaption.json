    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man walking forward in an alley, with the camera tracking from behind. The man is centered in the frame, showing his upper body and occupying about half of the frame\u2019s height. He is wearing a dark jacket with his hands in the pockets, and the collar of his jacket is flipped up. He has short hair. The alley is narrow, with tall buildings on either side, and the man is moving towards the brighter end of the alley. The focus remains on the man as he walks, with the surroundings providing context to his movement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot showing a character from shoulder height, set in a narrow urban alleyway. The environment is outdoors, with tall buildings on either side, creating a confined space. The alley is lined with textured brick walls, one side featuring signs of wear, while the other has a more uniform, tiled appearance. The ground is concrete, with scattered debris and puddles suggesting recent rain. Overhead, fire escapes add to the urban atmosphere. The time of day appears to be overcast, with diffused light casting soft shadows. The scene transitions smoothly as the character walks through the alley, moving towards a brighter street visible at the end, where more modern buildings and a stop sign can be seen. A bus passes by on the perpendicular street at the end of the alley.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video shows a man walking forward in an alley, with the camera tracking from behind. The man is centered in the frame, showing his upper body, but only occupying about half of the frame\u2019s height, leaving more room for the surroundings.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This video features a medium shot of a man walking forward in an alley, with the camera positioned at his level and tracking from behind. The man is centered in the frame, showing his upper body and occupying approximately half of the frame's height. His 2D position is central, and in 3D, he is in the foreground, moving towards the background. The alley is narrow, with tall buildings on either side; the building on the left is in the left portion of the frame and in the middle ground, while the building on the right occupies the right portion and also extends into the middle ground. The textured brick wall on the left and the tiled wall on the right frame the scene laterally. The ground, with scattered debris and puddles, is in the lower part of the frame and in the foreground. Fire escapes are visible overhead, near the top of the frame, adding depth to the middle ground. As the man walks, the scene transitions smoothly, revealing a brighter street at the end of the alley in the background. This street, along with modern buildings and a stop sign, becomes more prominent in the top and far background as the man approaches. A bus passing by on the perpendicular street is visible in the top right corner of the frame, further",
