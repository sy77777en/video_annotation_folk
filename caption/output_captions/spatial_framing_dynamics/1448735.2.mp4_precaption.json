    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the lush forest, trees, and greenery. The emphasis is on the atmosphere and the immersive experience of the forest, rather than a specific object or subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a lush, dense forest setting during daylight. Tall trees with thick trunks and vibrant green foliage dominate the scene, creating a canopy that filters sunlight onto the forest floor. The ground is covered with a mix of brown earth and scattered moss-covered rocks, adding texture and color contrast. A narrow, winding path meanders through the trees, suggesting a natural trail. A small stream flows gently through the forest. The overall atmosphere is serene and untouched, with the drone's perspective providing a sweeping view of the forest's depth and natural beauty.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a dense forest, capturing an expansive view of the natural environment. The camera starts with a focus on the foreground, where moss-covered rocks and the forest floor are visible in the bottom right, while tall trees with thick trunks occupy the left and center areas. As the video progresses, the camera gradually moves forward and slightly upward, transitioning from a lower angle to a higher vantage point. This shift reveals more of the middle ground, where a narrow, winding path becomes prominent, snaking through the trees. The path is flanked by dense vegetation and leads deeper into the forest. In the background, additional trees and a small stream come into view, enhancing the sense of depth. The camera maintains a consistent height relative to the forest floor, ensuring a sweeping perspective that emphasizes the forest's vastness and intricate details. The spatial arrangement shifts subtly, with the initial focus on the immediate surroundings evolving into a broader view that includes the path and distant elements.",
