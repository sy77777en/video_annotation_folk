    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide scenery shot, capturing a vast landscape under a massive storm. The storm cloud system dominates the upper two-thirds of the frame, positioned in the middle ground and background. Its darkest, most defined shelf-like structure stretches from the center to the left, while lighter, higher clouds fill the top and right portions of the frame. Curtains of precipitation are visible falling in the center and left middle ground, connecting the cloud base to the land. The bottom third of the frame is occupied by a flat prairie in the foreground and middle ground, with the horizon line situated low. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up, which emphasizes the scale of the storm. In the time-lapse, the clouds churn and billow, with the entire formation showing dynamic internal movement as it progresses across the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific main subject. A colossal, dark supercell storm cloud with a defined, shelf-like structure dominates the sky, its turbulent base churning ominously. Below the darkest part of the formation, the atmosphere is tinged with a sickly green light, a common indicator of severe weather, as curtains of heavy precipitation fall onto the flat, open prairie below. The sheer size of the weather system, filling the entire upper portion of the frame, makes the storm itself the central element, highlighting the raw power of nature.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse captures a massive, turbulent storm system moving across a flat, grassy plain. The sky is dominated by a vast, dark shelf cloud with layered gray and white textures. The underside of the cloud is nearly black, and a distinct green hue colors the atmosphere where sheets of rain fall in the distance. The clouds churn and swirl as the storm advances across the wide, open landscape under a darkened daytime sky. The horizon is a thin line of subtle brown hills in the far distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
