    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up of a hand holding a blue spool, with a string extending upwards. The hand appears to be of medium skin tone and is wearing a dark wristband. The string is connected to kites visible against a clear sky. Two kites are clearly red, while the colors of the other kites are not discernible. The kites appear to be flying at different heights, possibly attached to different strings. In the background, there are people gathered, possibly watching the kites, and some buildings are visible in the distance. The scene conveys a sense of outdoor activity and leisure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, shows a silhouetted hand wearing a black watch holding a large, blue plastic kite winder. A thin white string extends from the winder, leading the view upward into a pale, overcast sky. High in the sky, several small, colorful kites, including red and yellow ones, are flying. The scene takes place in an open field with green bushes and trees. In the background, houses, a street with a lamppost, and distant city buildings are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a silhouetted hand holding a blue spool occupies the foreground, positioned from the bottom left to the center of the frame. A thin string extends from the spool in the foreground, traveling vertically up the center of the frame toward several small kites flying high in the background sky. In the middle ground, foliage lines the bottom of the frame, with houses and distant buildings visible in the background on the bottom right. The camera then tilts upward, causing the hand and spool to shift toward the bottom edge of the frame. This movement re-centers the view on the sky, bringing the kites from the upper portion of the frame to a more central position within the background.",
