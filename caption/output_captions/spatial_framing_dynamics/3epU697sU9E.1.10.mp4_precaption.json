    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a classroom setting, a group of elementary school-aged children, mostly Black, are seen from behind, sitting in green plastic chairs and wearing white or yellow short-sleeved shirts. At the front of the room, an older white man with graying hair, wearing a dark suit, a white shirt, and a red tie, sits on a chair looking mostly to the left side of the frame. Next to him, a Black woman with dark hair, wearing a dark top and a lanyard, is seated and holds a book, appearing to be ready to read to the students, as she has not opened the book yet. A second white man, also in a dark suit, enters from the left, leans over, and speaks to the first man who is seated.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This scene is set within a classroom, where several children are seated in rows of dark green plastic chairs, facing the front. At the front of the room, a man in a dark suit and red tie is seated, while a woman sits nearby holding a book. A purple easel stands between them, displaying papers and a small book. The background consists of a blackboard and some whiteboards, all covered with educational posters, papers, and children's artwork. To the left, a shelving unit is filled with books and supplies. During the scene, another man in a suit approaches the seated man and speaks to him.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot, filmed at the subjects' level, initially frames a group of children from behind, occupying the foreground and lower middle ground. In the middle ground, a seated man is positioned in the top left, while a seated woman is in the top right, with a purple easel between them. The background consists of classroom walls and a blackboard. A second man then enters the frame from the left, moves into the middle ground, and leans over to speak to the seated man in the top left quadrant of the scene.",
