    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, capturing a static, low-angle view of a grand, illuminated basilica at night. On the right side of the frame, the building's white stone facade, featuring intricate carvings, arched windows, and a domed tower, glows against the dark, cloudy sky. Positioned in front of the basilica is a large, verdigris-patinated equestrian statue, bathed in a cool, blue-green light, depicting a figure on horseback holding a cross. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the majestic architectural environment and the moody, reverent atmosphere created by the dramatic lighting and scale. The composition emphasizes the grandeur of the location rather than a specific object or character.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A low-angle, nighttime view captures a section of the illuminated, white-stone facade of the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica in Paris against a dark, cloudy sky. To the right of the frame, a large equestrian statue with a greenish-blue patina stands on a pedestal in front of the building. The camera performs a slow, smooth zoom-in while maintaining deep focus, ensuring the entire scene remains sharp. An overlay in the bottom right corner contains the text \"MATHIEU STANIC\" with \"PHOTOGRAPHY\" underneath.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, low-angle scenery shot of an illuminated basilica and an equestrian statue against a dark night sky. The basilica occupies the right side of the frame in the middle ground, while the statue is positioned in the bottom right, in the foreground relative to the building. The dark sky fills the left and top portions of the frame, acting as the background. The camera executes a slow, smooth zoom-in, causing the basilica and statue to grow larger and fill more of the frame, with the statue shifting slightly toward the center-right. A static text overlay is present in the bottom right corner throughout the shot.",
