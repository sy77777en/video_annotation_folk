    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an interior scenery shot. The focus is on the environment, emphasizing the architectural design and atmosphere rather than a specific object. The shots highlight the scale and spatial arrangement, creating a sense of place. This type of shot could serve as an establishing shot, setting the scene and providing context for the viewer.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moves forward from a narrow entryway with short steps, all covered in small white tiles. The camera passes through a rectangular doorway into a larger, sparsely lit room. This space features the same white-tiled floor, but with a large, recessed rectangular area in the center defined by a black-tiled border and a white interior. The lower portion of the walls is a dark, solid color, contrasting with the white-tiled upper walls. Several circular lights in the ceiling illuminate the sterile, geometric interior with a cool, greenish-white light.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from a first-person perspective. Initially, the camera is at a low angle, looking up a short flight of white-tiled steps that occupy the bottom of the frame. These steps lead to a rectangular doorway positioned in the center, which frames a view into a darker room in the middle ground, where a single circular light is visible in the background. The camera then moves forward and upward, passing through the central doorway. As it enters the next space, the perspective shifts to a more level height, revealing a large room. A recessed, square-shaped area with a black-tiled border and a white-tiled interior now dominates the floor in the middle ground, while the surrounding walls and multiple ceiling lights fill the rest of the frame.",
