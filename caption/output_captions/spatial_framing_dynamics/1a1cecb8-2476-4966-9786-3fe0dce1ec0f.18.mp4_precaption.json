    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an urban scenery shot of a street corner at dusk. The scene begins with a pedestrian with pink hair walking on the sidewalk, adding a splash of color to the setting. The focus then shifts to an intersection with a crosswalk, where a silver sedan and other vehicles pass through. The area is lined with a mix of brick and modern buildings, surrounded by numerous large, leafy trees under an overcast sky, with streetlights already illuminated. The camera's wide, panning view is intended to capture the overall atmosphere and environment, establishing a sense of place within this campus-like setting rather than highlighting any single person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a street corner at dusk under an overcast sky. The camera pans across an intersection with white crosswalk markings on the asphalt. Illuminated, classic-style lampposts line the sidewalk, and traffic lights are active. The area is surrounded by numerous trees, some with green leaves and others with bare branches. In the background, multi-story brick buildings and a low stone wall are visible. A person with pink hair is seen from behind on the sidewalk, while cars, including a silver sedan, move in front of the crosswalk through the intersection. A blue street sign reads \"SE UNIVERSITY AVE\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide scenery shot, captured from an eye-level perspective, begins with a person with pink hair in the bottom-left foreground. The camera then pans to the right, causing the person to exit the frame as the view shifts to an intersection. Initially, the crosswalk is in the center middle ground, but as the camera moves, it expands to occupy the foreground and center of the frame. A silver sedan enters from the right and stops in the right middle ground, while other cars are visible in the center middle ground. The final frame shows the intersection centrally, with trees in the left middle ground and a large building in the right background.",
