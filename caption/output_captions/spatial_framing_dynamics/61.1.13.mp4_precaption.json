    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a Black man with long dreadlocks and a graying beard and mustache, who is sitting and gesturing with his hands. He wears a light-colored fedora-style hat, white square-framed sunglasses, a green jacket over a red, white, and black patterned shirt, and a pearl necklace. On his wrists, he has a gold-colored watch and beaded bracelets, and he wears a large, shiny ring on his right hand. In the background, to his left, a white woman with long blonde hair is also visible, sitting down.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a dimly lit establishment at night, characterized by a warm, greenish-yellow ambient glow. In the foreground, a person's hand is visible, adding depth to the composition. In the middle ground, two individuals are seated behind a Black man, contributing to the lively atmosphere. In the background, deep red curtains hang next to a window, and framed pictures are visible on the wall. A person is seated in a brown booth, with the interior lighting creating a hazy atmosphere. A faint white neon light can be seen further in the background. The camera remains close to the main subject, capturing their energetic movements within the confined space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. To his left, a woman sits in the background, while another person's hand is visible in the foreground on the right. In the background, red curtains hang on the right side of the frame, and framed pictures are on the wall behind the man. The man initially gestures with his hands near his face before leaning forward and down, moving toward the bottom of the frame and briefly closer to the camera. The camera remains at the subject's level.",
