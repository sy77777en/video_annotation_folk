    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a figurine lying face-down on the ground, partially obscured by wooden structures. The figurine is light-colored and initially visible from the knee up, with an arm extended outward. As the camera moves, the entire figure is revealed, showing it in a horizontal position. The wooden structures, which appear to be shelf-like, cover parts of the figurine, creating a layered effect. Scattered around the scene are small, colorful objects, adding texture to the setting. The focus remains on the figurine and its interaction with the surrounding elements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a tiled floor, where a large, abstract sculpture resembling a human figure lies horizontally. Surrounding the figure are several wooden structures, possibly resembling shelves or crates, some of which are overturned or leaning. Scattered across the floor are small, colorful objects, adding a sense of disarray. The scene is well-lit, suggesting an artificial light source typical of an indoor environment. Added text is present in the lower left corner, indicating additional information not part of the physical scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot seems to focus on one main subject, a figurine lying on the ground, partially covered by wooden structures. Initially, the figure is visible from the knee up, but as the camera moves upward, a full shot of the figure is revealed.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a high-angle view, focusing on a figurine lying horizontally on the ground, partially obscured by wooden structures. The shot size transitions from a partial view of the figurine, initially showing it from the knee up, to a full shot revealing the entire figure. The figurine occupies the center of the frame, with its 2D position shifting slightly as the camera moves. In the 3D space, the figurine is in the middle ground, while the wooden structures, positioned in the foreground and background, create a layered effect. These structures are scattered across the left, right, and top areas of the frame. Small, colorful objects are dispersed throughout the scene, primarily in the middle ground, enhancing the visual texture. The camera maintains a consistent height above the subject, providing a clear overhead perspective throughout the video. The transition from a partial to a full view of the figurine occurs smoothly, with the camera moving upward to reveal more of the scene. The tiled floor serves as the backdrop, extending across the entire frame. The added text in the lower left corner remains static, providing additional context without altering the spatial dynamics.",
