    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of people walking across a misty, barren landscape. There are five individuals, all wearing similar protective clothing, making it difficult to determine their gender or age due to the foggy environment and distance. On the left, one person stands slightly apart from the group, while another individual with a slightly hunched posture is towards the right. Some of the individuals appear to be carrying rifles. The scene is characterized by a somber, foggy atmosphere, with the figures moving together across the terrain.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor scene set in a foggy, desolate landscape. The time of day is indeterminate due to the thick fog that envelops the area, creating a muted, monochromatic atmosphere. The ground is barren, with sparse, charred vegetation suggesting a recently burned or devastated area. Silhouettes of several figures are visible, moving across the terrain, adding a sense of motion and life to the otherwise still environment. A vehicle is partially visible on the left, appearing abandoned and blending into the bleak surroundings. Tall trees rise in the background on the right side, partially obscured by the fog, adding an element of mystery to the scene. The overall mood is somber, with the fog obscuring distant details and creating a sense of isolation.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot capturing a desolate, foggy landscape. A group of five silhouetted figures occupies the middle ground, positioned slightly left of the frame's center. They are moving slowly as a group towards the right side of the frame. To their left, also in the middle ground, rests the silhouette of a vehicle on a slight incline. The foreground consists of dark, barren ground with sparse, charred vertical elements scattered across it. On the far right, tall trees fade into the dense fog in the background. The upper half of the frame is dominated by the uniform, foggy sky. The camera remains static throughout the shot, positioned at a relatively eye-level height compared to the figures in the middle ground.",
