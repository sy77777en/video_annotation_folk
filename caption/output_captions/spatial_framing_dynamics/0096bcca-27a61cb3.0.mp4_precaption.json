    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the urban environment, capturing the atmosphere of a city at night. The emphasis is on the overall setting, including the gas station, streetlights, and surrounding streets, rather than a specific object or subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a dashcam POV mounted on a vehicle, shows an urban street scene at night. The setting is outdoors, featuring a well-lit intersection with a Gulf gas station prominently visible. Streetlights and traffic signals illuminate the area, casting light on the road and surrounding structures. The gas station is active with cars parked nearby. The environment is calm, with clear weather conditions, allowing for a clear view of the road and the gas station's signage. **\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban street scene at night, capturing a broad view of the surroundings. Initially, the camera focuses on the left side of the scene, showing a bus stop sign in the foreground on the left, with a Gulf gas station visible in the middle ground on the right. The bus stop sign is positioned in the bottom left corner of the frame, while the gas station occupies the center-right portion. The gas station's signage is illuminated, standing out against the dark sky. In the background, streetlights and traffic signals are scattered across the scene, illuminating the road and buildings. As the video progresses, the camera pans slightly to the right, shifting the focus more towards the gas station and the street in front of it. The gas station moves closer to the center of the frame, while the bus stop sign moves out of view. The camera remains at a consistent height, likely mounted on a vehicle, providing a steady perspective throughout the video. The overall spatial composition maintains a clear view of the road, the gas station, and the surrounding urban environment.",
