    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a high-angle cityscape scenery shot, capturing a breathtaking panoramic view of a historic walled city on a peninsula. The city is a dense cluster of buildings with iconic terracotta-orange roofs, all enclosed by formidable ancient stone walls that meet the deep blue sea. A small harbor, filled with numerous white boats, is nestled into the city's edge where the water is a vibrant turquoise. The perspective is from a rocky, green mountainside in the foreground, with a cable car tower visible on the right, descending towards the urban area. There is no main subject because the composition is designed to emphasize the grand scale, stunning location, and overall atmosphere of the entire city and its relationship with the surrounding natural landscape, rather than focusing on a specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high, rocky vantage point, the scene captures a panoramic view of the historic walled city of Dubrovnik, Croatia, situated on a peninsula jutting into the deep blue Adriatic Sea. The city is a dense collection of buildings with characteristic orange-red terracotta roofs, all enclosed by massive, light-gray stone fortifications. A small harbor with numerous docked white boats is tucked into the city's edge, where the water is a vibrant turquoise. In the foreground, the rocky, green hillside is dotted with sparse vegetation. To the right, a modern cable car pylon stands out against the historic backdrop. In the distance, a small, tree-covered island sits in the calm sea under clear skies. A watermark for \"Xscion.org\" with the word \"COPYRIGHT\" is present in the top left corner as an overlay.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a coastal city, captured from a high-angle perspective. In the foreground, a rocky, green hillside spans the bottom of the frame. The historic walled city is the central element in the middle ground, with its harbor and boats positioned on its left side. A cable car tower stands in the bottom right. The deep blue sea fills the background at the top of the frame, with a small, tree-covered island in the top left. A watermark is visible in the top left corner. Throughout the shot, the camera performs a very slow and subtle zoom-in, causing the city to gradually increase in size within the frame.",
