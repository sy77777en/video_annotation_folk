    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This animated video shows two white passenger jets at an airport under hazy, reddish-brown skies. In the foreground, one jet with swept-back wings is seen from a high angle from behind, positioned in the center of a runway. In the background, a second, similar jet appears smaller as it flies on an approach path aligned with the same runway. Text at the bottom of the screen displays a radio transmission from \"FDX1432\" in orange letters, initially issuing the command \"Southwest, abort!\" followed by the message \"Fedex is on the go.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of an airport runway under hazy, reddish-brown skies, suggesting either dawn, dusk, or poor visibility. In the foreground, a white airplane is positioned on a long, dark gray runway marked with white lines and dark tire scuffs. Yellow-lined taxiways intersect the runway, surrounded by flat, brown, grassy terrain. In the distance, another white airplane is visible in the air, aligned with the same runway, with the faint silhouette of an urban area on the horizon. An overlay in a black box at the bottom of the screen displays text with \"FDX1432:\" in orange, followed by \"Southwest, abort!\" and \"Fedex is on the go\" in white, in typewriter-style font.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot from a high angle, looking down on an airport. In the bottom center foreground, a white airplane is positioned on a runway that extends vertically toward the top of the frame. A second, smaller airplane is visible in the top center background, flying on an approach path aligned with the same runway. Taxiways intersect the runway in the lower half of the frame. The camera and all subjects remain stationary throughout the shot, while a text overlay at the bottom of the screen changes its message.",
