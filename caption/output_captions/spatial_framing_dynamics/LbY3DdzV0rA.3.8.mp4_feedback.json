    "pre_caption": "This video is presented as a static extreme wide shot of a landscape, with the camera positioned at a low angle looking up. The composition is divided, with the sky and clouds occupying the upper two-thirds of the frame and a silhouetted landscape filling the bottom third. Initially, illuminated storm clouds are positioned in the center and left middle ground, set against a deep blue sky in the background. A dark cloud mass dominates the right side of the frame. In the foreground and middle ground, a dark horizon line is punctuated by silhouetted power lines on the bottom left and distant city lights in the center and right background. As the time-lapse progresses, the sky darkens to reveal stars and faint light trails moving across the top right background, while the illuminated clouds recede and the dark clouds on the right expand. Lightning flashes intermittently within the middle-ground clouds and in the far background on the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot of a thunderstorm transitioning from day to night. The composition emphasizes the vastness of the environment and the powerful atmospheric phenomena. As the day turns to night, massive, billowing storm clouds are internally illuminated by frequent flashes of lightning, causing them to glow with vibrant pink and purple hues. Below the turbulent clouds, a dark, silhouetted landscape stretches across the horizon, punctuated by the twinkling lights of a distant city and the faint outline of power lines. Occasional, distinct bolts of lightning can be seen striking in the far distance, adding to the dynamic visual experience.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse captures a dramatic storm transitioning from day to night over a distant, dark landscape. Against a deep blue, star-filled sky, massive, billowing clouds are illuminated from within by intermittent flashes of lightning, casting them in shades of pink and purple. Below the turbulent clouds, the dark silhouette of the horizon is dotted with the faint glow of distant city lights. On the left, the silhouettes of power lines stand against the illuminated sky. Throughout the sequence, lightning continues to flash within the clouds and strike in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
