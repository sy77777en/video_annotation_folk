    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from a static, low-angle perspective. Initially, a large, two-story brick building is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The foreground consists of tall grass and a path across the bottom of the frame, while trees are visible in the background on the left and right sides. A massive white explosion suddenly erupts from the building, expanding from the center to engulf the structure and fill most of the frame. This is immediately followed by multiple fiery bursts that shoot outwards and upwards from the building's windows and roof. Finally, thick black smoke billows from the central structure, rising to obscure the building and the upper portion of the frame, leaving the scene almost entirely dark.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic scenery shot capturing the destruction of a building. The focus is on the powerful event and the resulting atmosphere rather than a specific subject. The scale of the fiery explosion serves as the visual centerpiece, emphasizing the action and its environmental impact. The sequence shows a large, two-story brick warehouse at dusk being consumed by a massive explosion, which begins as an overwhelming white flash before transitioning into multiple fiery bursts erupting from the windows and roof, ultimately shrouding the structure in thick, dark smoke against the twilight sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor scene at dusk, a large, two-story brick building with a gabled roof stands in a field of tall grass under a dark, cloudy sky. A powerful explosion erupts, initially as a blinding white flash that completely engulfs the structure. This is immediately followed by fiery bursts of orange and yellow flames and thick black smoke that billows out from the building, eventually leaving it silhouetted in darkness. The video suggests that an ammunition depot is blown up, possibly by a group of communist resistance fighters.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
