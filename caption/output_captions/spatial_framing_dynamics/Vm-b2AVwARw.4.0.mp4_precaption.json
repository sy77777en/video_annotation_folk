    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a futuristic cityscape scenery shot at night, focusing on the overall high-tech environment and grand scale rather than a specific subject. The scene is dominated by a towering, curvilinear skyscraper whose dark facade is covered in a repeating pattern of glowing white, three-pointed star-like shapes. Bright, cyan light traces the vertical edges of this central building, making it stand out against the dark surroundings. The rest of the city consists of silhouetted skyscrapers and smaller structures, all interconnected by a glowing white network of concentric and intersecting lines that suggest advanced roadways or energy grids, creating a dark, sleek, and technologically advanced atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a futuristic cityscape at night, centered on a tall, curvilinear skyscraper. The building's dark facade is covered in a grid of glowing white, three-pointed star patterns, while its sides are illuminated by bright vertical cyan lights. Surrounding the central tower are the dark silhouettes of other buildings and a network of glowing white lines that form roads in concentric circles. An overlay in the top right corner displays the text, \"Animations are for illustrative purposes only. The final build...\"**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide, high-angle shot of a futuristic cityscape at night. A tall, curvilinear skyscraper is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground as the scene's primary focus. Surrounding this central tower, the dark silhouettes of other buildings are visible in the middle ground and background, filling the left, right, and bottom portions of the frame. A network of glowing white lines, representing roads, is situated in the foreground and middle ground at the bottom of the scene, weaving between the structures. A text overlay is located in the top right corner of the frame. The camera remains stationary, maintaining its high-angle perspective looking down on the city.",
