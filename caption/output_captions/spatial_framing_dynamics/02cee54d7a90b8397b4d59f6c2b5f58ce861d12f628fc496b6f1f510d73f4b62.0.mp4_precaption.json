    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two women on a spiral staircase. The woman at the top has light skin and is wearing a white shirt, a checkered vest, and a black skirt. She is leaning over the railing. The woman on the stairs has dark skin and curly hair, wearing a white blouse, dark pants, and black shoes. She is seated on the steps, and is reading a book. The staircase is wooden and centrally located, with both women positioned prominently on it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting featuring a spacious room with a prominent spiral staircase made of polished wood. The staircase, with its smooth curves and vertical slats, serves as a central architectural element, connecting two levels of the room. Large windows with white frames allow natural light to flood the space, creating a bright and airy atmosphere. The walls are painted in a muted green tone, complementing the warm wood accents. The room is furnished with simple wooden tables and chairs, contributing to a cozy and inviting environment. A wooden bookshelf is also present, suggesting that the room might be a reading area. The overall scene is well-lit, suggesting daytime, and the arrangement of furniture and architectural features provides a harmonious and balanced composition.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot capturing two women on a spiral staircase within a spacious indoor setting. The woman at the top of the staircase is positioned in the upper middle part of the frame, leaning over the railing. She is in the background, elevated above the other woman. The second woman is seated on the stairs, located in the lower middle section of the frame, closer to the foreground. Both women remain stationary throughout the video, maintaining their respective positions on the staircase. The spiral staircase itself occupies the central area of the frame, serving as the focal point. The large windows with white frames are situated in the background, allowing natural light to enter the room. The muted green walls and wooden furniture, including tables and chairs, are distributed around the room, enhancing the sense of depth. The camera remains at a fixed height, capturing the scene from a slightly elevated angle, providing a clear view of both the women and the surrounding environment. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the subjects and elements throughout the video.",
