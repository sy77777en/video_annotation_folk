    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a high-angle cityscape scenery shot showcasing the magnificent, intricately detailed facade of a grand cathedral. The building features elaborate carvings, multiple arched doorways, and a striking polychrome marble pattern of yellow, green, red, and white. Below, a public square is predominantly covered in shadows, bustling with numerous people standing within them. There is no single main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the impressive scale of the architecture and the lively atmosphere of the historic location, focusing on the overall environment rather than a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, the scene captures the Piazza del Duomo in Florence on a bright, sunny day. The ornate facade of the Florence Cathedral dominates the view, showcasing its intricate polychrome marble design in white, green, and pink. Detailed features include pointed arches, elaborate carvings, large bronze doors, and circular rose windows. To the right, a portion of another building displays a similar striped marble pattern of white and dark green. The sun casts strong, dark shadows across the stone-paved square below, where numerous people are seen walking and congregating in front of the historic structures.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, high-angle scenery shot with no single main subject, capturing a bustling city square. The ornate facade of a large cathedral occupies the top left and center of the frame in the middle ground. To the right, a portion of another building with a striped pattern is positioned in the foreground, partially obscuring the view. At the bottom of the frame, a public square filled with people lies in the middle ground, situated between the two buildings. The camera executes a very slow, subtle zoom-in or forward dolly movement toward the cathedral's central entrance throughout the shot.",
