    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a pair of light-skinned hands holds a black, mirrorless-style digital camera. The person is wearing a dark, long-sleeved jacket. The left hand supports the camera from below, while the right hand grips the side. The camera's flip-out screen is on and facing the viewer, displaying a live image of the scene ahead. The brand name \"SONY\" is visible in white letters on the bottom bezel of the screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a person holding a black camera on a stone promenade in Porto, Portugal, during sunrise. The sun is low on the horizon, creating a bright flare and silhouetting a large, prominent tree against a clear blue sky. To the left, traditional European buildings line the waterfront, while across the river, a hillside covered with buildings is visible. The person is composing a shot, and the camera's screen displays a live view of the sunlit scene with the silhouetted tree.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person point of view, a pair of hands holding a digital camera occupies the foreground. The left hand is positioned in the bottom-left foreground, supporting the camera from below, while the right hand grips it from the center-right. The camera itself is held in the center of the frame, its screen displaying a live view of the background scene. In the middle ground, a large tree is silhouetted in the center by the rising sun, with buildings lining a promenade to the left and a river and hillside to the right. A dark pole stands in the immediate left foreground. The hands and camera remain relatively static with slight adjustments as a photo is taken, filmed from the subject's eye level.",
