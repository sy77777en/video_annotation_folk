    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a locked-on POV, the main subject is a person in a red kayak paddling through turbulent whitewater in a narrow canyon. This individual, seen from the back, wears a bright red waterproof jacket, a black life vest with green side panels, and a dark gray helmet with a white and red \"Teva\" logo on the back. They are holding a black paddle. In the distance, ahead of the main subject, is a second person also in a red kayak.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot fixed to a kayaker, the viewer is immersed in the action of navigating a turbulent river through a narrow canyon. The steep, dark rock walls of the gorge rise on either side, creating a tight passage filled with churning, white water. The kayaker in the foreground, wearing a red drysuit and a grey helmet with a \"Teva\" logo, paddles vigorously, while another kayaker in a red boat can be seen further down the rapids. The fast-moving water and the proximity of the canyon walls create a dynamic outdoor scene during the daytime.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a kayaker is positioned in the foreground, occupying the bottom center of the frame. A second kayaker is visible further ahead in the middle ground, also in the center of the frame. Steep, dark canyon walls line the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. The camera is locked onto the main subject, who remains fixed in their position within the frame while paddling forward through the turbulent water. As the kayaker moves, the canyon walls and the secondary kayaker in the middle ground appear to move towards the camera. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
