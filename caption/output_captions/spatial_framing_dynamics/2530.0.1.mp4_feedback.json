    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot. A right hand is prominently featured in the center-right foreground, its fingers gripping a dark, striped fabric that extends across the center foreground. To the immediate left of the right hand, also in the foreground, a portion of a left hand is visible, similarly gripping the fabric. A larger, out-of-focus arm occupies the far-left foreground. The background is a uniformly bright, out-of-focus expanse. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up view shows a human hand with a light to medium skin tone, appearing somewhat weathered with visible wrinkles and veins. The right hand's fingers are slightly curled, resting on or gripping a dark, possibly black, fabric. This fabric features thin, lighter-colored, possibly white or grey, horizontal stripes or a ribbed texture. Additionally, a left hand is also resting on or gripping the same fabric.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is a close-up, brightly lit shot, likely taking place outdoors during the daytime. The background is a uniformly light, out-of-focus expanse. Prominently featured is a human hand on the right, its skin showing texture and veins, gripping a black and white striped fabric, possibly part of an item of clothing. Additionally, a large arm is visible on the left side of the frame, which adds to the composition.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
