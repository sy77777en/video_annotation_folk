    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot, with the main subject positioned centrally in the foreground. Her left hand is raised near her forehead as she turns her head from her left towards her right. In the middle ground behind her, three other individuals are positioned: one to her left, a second individual next to the first (also to the main subject's left), and a third partially visible on the far right. A white-painted brick wall forms the background across the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with medium skin tone and dark hair pulled back is the main focus, positioned in the foreground and looking from her left to her right while speaking, with her left hand raised near her forehead. She wears a blue, long-sleeved athletic top with a white Nike swoosh on the right chest and a small, indistinct logo on the right chest, along with small hoop earrings. Behind her and slightly out of focus are three other individuals. On the left, a woman with dark hair pulled back wears a pink t-shirt and has a blue garment draped over her left shoulder. Next to her, another woman with dark hair pulled back wears a pink t-shirt featuring a black Nike swoosh on the right side of her chest. A third individual is partially visible on the far right, wearing a red and black patterned top. All background individuals appear to be looking in a similar direction as the main subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, in a dimly lit room with a white-painted brick wall in the background. Several individuals are present; one in the foreground wears a blue, long-sleeved top with a white swoosh logo on the chest. In the background, other individuals are visible, some wearing pink tops.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
