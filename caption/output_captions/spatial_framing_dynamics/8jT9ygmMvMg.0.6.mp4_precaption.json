    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, initially flying low along a sunlit canal in Venice, flanked by colorful, historic buildings with terracotta roofs. The camera then ascends, revealing a broader panorama of the densely packed city, showcasing more canals, diverse architecture, and the expanse of rooftops under a clear blue sky. There is no single main subject because the focus is on capturing the overall environment, atmosphere, and architectural scale of Venice, emphasizing the unique urban landscape formed by its waterways and historic structures rather than singling out a specific element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone glides smoothly along a narrow canal in Venice, Italy, under a clear blue sky. The water in the canal is dark, reflecting the surrounding multi-story buildings. These buildings, with facades in shades of ochre, yellow, and red, feature terracotta tile roofs and numerous rectangular windows, some with shutters. As the drone continues forward, it ascends, revealing a broader cityscape of similar architecture, with more canals and buildings stretching into the distance, punctuated by a few distant bell towers. A small, green-covered boat is moored along one side of the canal. The sunlight casts long shadows, indicating either morning or late afternoon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.",
    "pre_caption": "The video commences with a wide shot, featuring a canal in the center of the frame, stretching from the foreground towards the middle ground. Buildings are positioned on the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, with the sky occupying the top background. The camera, initially low, moves forward along the canal and then ascends, transitioning to an extreme wide shot. In this subsequent framing, the initial canal is visible in the bottom center, receding into the middle ground, while a broad cityscape of rooftops and buildings populates the middle ground and background across the left, center, and right, with the sky remaining in the top background.",
