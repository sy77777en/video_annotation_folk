    "pre_caption": "In a static close-up shot, a man is framed in profile from the shoulders up. He is positioned in the foreground, occupying the left and central portions of the frame while facing toward the left. The camera is positioned at his level. The background is completely out of focus, creating a shallow depth of field that isolates the subject. There are no changes in framing or movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark skin is shown in a close-up, side-profile view in black and white. He has a very short, buzzed haircut and is wearing a baseball cap. A small hoop earring is visible in his left ear, and he wears a thin chain around his neck. He has some short facial hair on his chin and jawline. His mouth is open, and he is wearing a light-colored t-shirt that has a graphic on the back featuring horizontal stripes and a mountain-like design.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a grainy, black and white scene, a person is captured in profile from the shoulders up. They are wearing a baseball cap, a t-shirt with a partial graphic visible on the back, and a small hoop earring. Their mouth is open. The background is completely blurred, creating an extremely shallow depth of field that isolates the subject. The video has a consistent, textured, and monochromatic visual style.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
