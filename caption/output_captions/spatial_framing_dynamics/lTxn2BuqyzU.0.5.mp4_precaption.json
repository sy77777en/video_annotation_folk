    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a stylized, animated depiction of the inside of a stomach. The stomach is a large, C-shaped organ rendered in a deep red color, with smooth, curving interior walls. At the bottom of the stomach rests a pool of yellowish-tan liquid. Sprouting vertically from the center of this liquid is a small, green plant with several green leaves growing from its branches, adding a vibrant touch to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An animated, cross-sectional view shows the interior of a red, C-shaped stomach against a solid red background. A pool of yellowish liquid rests at the bottom of the organ. Emerging from the center of this liquid are two thin green sprouts, each with multiple blades, which sway gently.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "In this animated, cross-sectional view, a red stomach structure occupies the foreground and middle ground, curving from the top left, down across the bottom, and up toward the right side of the frame. Within the curve at the bottom of the frame, a pool of yellow liquid sits in the middle ground. A small green sprout emerges from the center of this liquid, positioned in the bottom center of the frame. The sprout sways gently from side to side. The camera remains static with a straight-on view of the scene, which is set against a solid red background.",
