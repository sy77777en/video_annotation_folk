    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of the castle, showing the stone archway and part of the bridge in the foreground, positioned centrally at the bottom of the frame, with the main castle structure rising in the center middle ground and background. The camera is at approximately the same height as the archway and bridge, looking straight ahead toward the castle. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to an extreme wide shot, pulling back to reveal more of the bridge, the people walking along it (now more clearly visible in the lower center and lower left/right foreground), and the surrounding dense forest, which fills the middle ground and background on both sides of the frame. The castle remains centrally positioned but appears smaller within the expanded view, emphasizing its placement atop the hill and its relationship to the landscape. The camera maintains a level height relative to the bridge and castle throughout the transition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a landscape scenery shot of a magnificent medieval castle. The structure, built from dark stone, features numerous towers and turrets with red-and-white timber framing and steep, dark-grey slate roofs, all set against a cloudy, overcast sky. The castle is perched on a hill and enveloped by a dense, lush green forest, with a stone bridge leading to an arched gateway where a few people are walking. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the grand scale and picturesque atmosphere of the castle within its natural environment. The people present are incidental, serving to emphasize the size of the structure rather than acting as focal points themselves.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene captures Eltz Castle, a large, medieval-style stone structure situated on a hill amidst a dense, green forest under an overcast sky. The castle features multiple towers and turrets with dark slate roofs, some of which have half-timbered upper sections with red and white details. A stone bridge leads up to a prominent stone archway that serves as an entrance. People are visible walking along the bridge towards the castle as the perspective gradually pulls back, revealing more of the bridge and the expansive forested landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.",
