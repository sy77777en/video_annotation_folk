    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a desaturated, sepia-toned scene, several stylized, low-polygon human figures are gathered around sacks. In the foreground, a large pile of grey, textured sacks, resembling burlap, is stacked on the ground. To the right, a small, child-like figure, rendered in a dark, geometric style, stands with arms crossed over the edge of a single open sack. Behind this child, a group of three taller, adult-like figures, also portrayed in a dark, geometric style, stands close together. On the far left, two tall, dark, stylized figures stand together. All the figures are depicted without discernible features, clothing details, or expressions, presented as dark, angular silhouettes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a desolate landscape with a dusty brown ground, a pile of grey, textured sacks rests in the foreground, with one sack standing upright and open. In the middle ground, a group of dark, stylized, low-polygon human figures stand together, with a smaller figure positioned by the open sack. An overlay of white text subtitles at the bottom left corner reads, \u201c[9,10,12].\u201d**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
