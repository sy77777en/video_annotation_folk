    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up of an oryx, an antelope species. The oryx has long, dark, ribbed horns that curve slightly backward. Its head is predominantly white with distinct brown markings: a stripe running down the center of its face from between its horns to its nose, a marking on its forehead, and patches around its eyes. Its ears are pointed and upright. The front part of its body, including its neck and shoulders, is a reddish-brown color, which transitions to a very light, almost white hue with a subtle bluish tint on the rest of its visible torso. The animal is facing slightly to its left, with its head turned to look directly at the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases a close-up view of a scimitar-horned oryx outdoors during the daytime. The animal, featuring its distinctive long, curved horns and a white and tan coat with a bluish tint, stands against an overexposed, brightly lit, out-of-focus background. The ground beneath appears to be light-colored sand or dirt.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of an oryx. The oryx's head is positioned in the center-left foreground, with its body extending towards the right side of the frame. The ground, appearing as light-colored sand or dirt, occupies the bottom foreground and middle ground. The background is an overexposed, out-of-focus area filling the rest of the frame. There are no changes in shot size or the position of elements throughout the video. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
