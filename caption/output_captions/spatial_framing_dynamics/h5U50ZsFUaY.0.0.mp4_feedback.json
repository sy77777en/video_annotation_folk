    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a paraglider is initially positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, with red rock cliffs occupying the bottom left foreground and a clear blue sky in the background. The camera, positioned below the subject, moves upward and forward, rising to the subject's height as the paraglider drifts toward the top of the frame. The paraglider then moves away from the camera and descends, transitioning from the top center to the center of the frame and from the middle ground into the background. As the camera tilts down to follow this movement, the sun appears in the background, and the canyon floor, featuring a body of water, becomes visible at the bottom of the frame. The shot concludes with the paraglider in the center background, silhouetted above the canyon edge in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man is paragliding, suspended in a harness beneath a large, white and blue canopy. He is wearing a light green long-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and a blue helmet. Initially, he holds onto the control handles, but then releases them, causing him to descend.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a paraglider soaring over a vast canyon. The outdoor setting is an expansive, arid landscape characterized by steep, reddish-brown rock cliffs under a clear, deep blue sky. The sun is low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the rugged terrain and creating a bright lens flare. At the bottom of the deep canyon, a winding body of water is visible. The paraglider, featuring a white and blue canopy, glides along the edge of the cliff face.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera height starts below the subject, then shifts to the subject\u2019s height as it moves closer. As the subject moves farther away, the distance makes it hard to determine the final camera height relative to the subject, but it is likely still at the subject\u2019s height.\n",
