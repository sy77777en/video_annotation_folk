    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video focuses on a light-skinned man, who appears to be in his 30s or 40s, shown from the chest up. He has a blondish-brown mustache covered in frost and wears a dark hood made of a material similar to fleece that covers his head and neck, along with a heavy winter coat with a strap over his right shoulder. Initially shown in profile, he turns to his left, briefly revealing more of his face before the camera returns to a profile view as it arcs around him. Positioned behind him and to his right is a second man with shaggy brown hair, a full beard, and layered, dark winter clothing. A third, more distant figure, also in heavy winter attire, stands further in the background. As the view tightens on the main subject, the two men behind him become obscured.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a cold, snowy wilderness during an overcast day. A shallow, icy river flows through the landscape, with snow-covered banks on either side. In the background, a dense forest of tall, dark evergreen trees covers a hillside beneath a pale, cloudy sky. Several men, clad in heavy, layered winter clothing with fur-lined hoods, are positioned on the snow-covered banks. One man is seen in a close-up in the foreground, with visible frost on his mustache, while others are further back in the mid-ground.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: At the beginning, there are three figures in the shot, from near to far. The camera focuses on the figure closest to the camera, who is the main subject, revealing a medium close-up shot of him. As the camera moves in an arc around the main subject, it obscures the figures behind, and finally, it's a close-up shot of the main subject.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "Initially, the scene is framed as a medium close-up, with the main subject positioned in the foreground on the right side of the frame. A second man occupies the middle ground to the left, while a third, more distant figure stands in the background, also on the left, near the center. The camera then performs a slow arc to the left, circling the main subject in the foreground. As it moves, the framing tightens into a close-up on the main subject's profile, and the camera's new position progressively obscures the two men who were previously visible behind him. The camera maintains a position at the subject's eye level throughout the shot.",
