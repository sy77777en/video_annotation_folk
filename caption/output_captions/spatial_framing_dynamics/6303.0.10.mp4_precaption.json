    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a laundromat, a man with dark, curly hair and a light brown complexion stands holding a white laundry basket. He wears a bright red, textured, long-sleeved sweater, brown pants, and red shoes, and he looks down toward a woman. The woman, who appears to be older, is seated on a black chair. She wears white headphones, a light green jacket over a pink shirt, light-colored pants, and reddish-brown shoes. Her hands are clasped in her lap, and a white laundry basket rests on a small bench next to her.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a stylized laundromat with a distinct visual design, captured from a high, wide-angle perspective that distorts the space. The room features solid blue walls and a black and white checkerboard tile floor. Banks of light-colored, front-loading washing machines line the walls, with some of the machine drums emitting a green glow. A vending machine stands against the back wall, and above a set of washers, a large, framed landscape painting in a traditional style is displayed. A similar landscape is visible through a cutout in the wall. The space is illuminated by square ceiling fixtures and horizontal fluorescent lights. An older woman is seated on a black chair on the left next to a laundry basket, while a man stands in the center holding another basket.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, a woman sits on a chair in the bottom left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. A man holding a laundry basket stands in the center, slightly to the right, also in the middle ground. The scene is captured with a wide-angle lens, distorting the perspective of the room. Banks of washing machines line the left and right walls, extending from the foreground to the background. In the background, a vending machine is located left of center, while a large landscape image is mounted on the wall to the right, and another is visible through a cutout on the left.",
