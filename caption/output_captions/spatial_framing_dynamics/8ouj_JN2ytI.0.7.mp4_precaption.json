    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A silhouetted man, wearing a mask, stands in a dark tunnel looking to the right of the frame. Initially, he gestures with his hand, and then a silhouetted hand gives him an object, possibly a phone, which he begins to manipulate with his fingers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From the dark, shadowy interior of a concrete tunnel, the view opens onto a brightly lit football stadium during the day. The expansive stands are filled with a dense crowd of spectators. A goalpost is visible on the field. A single, long fluorescent light is mounted on the ceiling of the tunnel. In the foreground, a person is seen in complete silhouette, standing within the tunnel and looking inside the tunnel to the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium shot shows a silhouetted man in the foreground on the left side of the frame, standing inside a dark tunnel that frames the scene. The tunnel opening reveals a brightly lit football stadium in the background, visible in the center and right portions of the frame. The man initially gestures with his right hand toward the right side of the frame, after which a second silhouetted hand enters from the right foreground and gives him a small object. The man then holds the object with both hands. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level.",
