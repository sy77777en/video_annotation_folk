    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with dark, curly hair and a light complexion stands on the left, wearing a blue t-shirt with horizontal stripes and looking toward an older person with a serious expression. To his right stands a young woman with long, dark brown hair and a light complexion, dressed in a pink top and a necklace; she also looks toward the older individual with a concerned expression. The third person, an older individual with white hair, is seen from the back, wearing a dark suit jacket over a white collared shirt. This person is in the foreground on the right, facing the two younger people who are standing together.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the scene is set within a dimly lit room with a desaturated color palette. A large, bright window serves as the primary light source, backlighting two younger individuals and revealing an out-of-focus residential exterior during the daytime. To the left of the window, dark horizontal blinds are visible against the wall. The foreground character, whose back is to the camera, wears a dark suit jacket, while the two people they face stand close together in the natural light from the window.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static medium close-up, over-the-shoulder shot. An older person, seen from behind, occupies the right foreground. In the middle ground, a young man stands on the left, and a young woman stands to his right, near the center of the frame. They are positioned in front of a large, bright window in the background, which is flanked by dark blinds on the far left. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
