    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A humanoid character with a round, orange, pumpkin-like head is shown. The head has simple, carved-out eyes and a smiling mouth. This character wears a long, hooded, blue-grey cloak that covers its body, revealing slender, rod-like legs resembling mechanical rods, and it is wearing dark brown shoes. In the bottom right corner, the upper body of a brown deer with white spots and large antlers is partially visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is a third-person 3D game scene where the entire character is visible on screen. It transitions between an outdoor and indoor setting. Outdoors, the scene features a small garden with a patch of tilled soil, surrounded by a white picket fence and a wooden house with a stone path leading to the entrance. The grass is lush and green, indicating a daytime setting with clear weather. Indoors, the environment is a cozy wooden room with a warm, rustic feel. Notable elements include a lit fireplace casting a soft glow, a red circular rug, a small round table with a candle holder, and a framed picture on the wall. The character interacts with various objects, such as tending to plants outside and engaging with furniture inside. Overlay elements include a HUD at the bottom of the screen displaying icons and numbers, which are not part of the scene itself.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "A wide, high-angle shot initially frames a pumpkin-headed character in the center-left middle ground, standing next to a tilled garden plot in the center-right. A deer is partially visible in the bottom-right foreground, with a house situated in the background at the top of the frame. The character walks from its starting position toward the house at the top-center. As the character enters the house, the front wall becomes transparent, revealing the interior. The character then moves to the center of the room, which now occupies the top half of the frame, while the camera maintains its wide, high-angle perspective.",
