    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman standing confidently on a wooden ramp in an indoor setting. She has short, light-colored hair and is wearing a light-colored knit hat, tank top, and pants, suggesting a casual style. The woman appears focused and poised, with a relaxed posture. Surrounding her are various skateboards mounted on the wall, adding a dynamic and sporty atmosphere to the scene. The lighting casts distinct shadows, enhancing the visual depth and highlighting her presence in the space. At the end of the video, a drone enters the frame from the left side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting resembling a modern, industrial-style loft with a skateboarding theme. The environment features a wooden ramp prominently placed in the center, surrounded by various skateboards mounted on the walls. The space is illuminated by natural light streaming through large windows, casting shadows and creating a warm ambiance. The interior includes eclectic elements such as neon signs and a mix of furniture, contributing to a creative and urban atmosphere. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as indicated by the angle and quality of the light. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining a focus on the unique combination of skate culture and contemporary design.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a woman standing on a wooden ramp in an indoor setting. Initially, she is positioned near the center of the frame, slightly towards the right, in the middle ground. As the camera slowly zooms in, she becomes more prominent, moving closer to the center of the frame while remaining in the middle ground. The ramp occupies the lower portion of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. Various skateboards are mounted on the wall behind her, located in the background and spanning across the left and center portions of the frame. A neon sign is visible on the left side of the frame, also in the background. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subject throughout the sequence, capturing her from a frontal perspective. The overall spatial composition emphasizes the subject's central role within the scene, with the surrounding elements providing context and depth.",
