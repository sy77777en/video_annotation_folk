    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a group of people walking through a tunnel. Initially, the subjects occupy the foreground and middle ground, positioned across the frame from left to right. Their backs face the camera, indicating they are moving away from the viewer toward the tunnel's exit. The tunnel's cylindrical structure surrounds them, with metallic walls and ceiling forming the background. The lighting starts as a dim red, casting shadows and highlighting the figures' silhouettes. As the group progresses, the camera remains at their level, maintaining a consistent perspective. The bright white light at the tunnel's end grows more intense, shifting the scene's illumination. The subjects move closer to the exit, transitioning from the red-lit area into the brighter section. By the end, the light envelops the figures, reducing their visibility while emphasizing their movement toward the exit. The camera captures this progression without changing its height or angle, keeping the subjects centered as they advance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of people walking through a tunnel. The individuals are mostly men, wearing casual clothing such as t-shirts, hoodies, and jeans. The lighting in the tunnel shifts from a dim red to a bright white, creating a dramatic contrast. The camera angle shows their backs as they walk towards a bright light at the end of the tunnel, emphasizing their movement and transition as the group progresses forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting within a dimly lit tunnel, characterized by its metallic walls and ceiling. The environment transitions from a dark, red-tinged atmosphere, with the red light originating from within the tunnel, to a bright, white light coming from outside as the exit gradually opens. The tunnel's structure is cylindrical, with ribbed metal surfaces that create a sense of depth and confinement. The lighting shifts dramatically, initially casting a red hue that highlights the silhouettes of several figures walking towards the exit. As the scene progresses and the exit opens further, the intensity of the bright white light increases, enveloping the figures and creating a stark contrast with the initial darkness. The overall ambiance is industrial, with a focus on the interplay between light and shadow, emphasizing the tunnel's linear perspective.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
