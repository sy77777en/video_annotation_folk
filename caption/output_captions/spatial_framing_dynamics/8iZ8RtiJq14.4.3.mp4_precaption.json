    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A humanoid figure with a reflective, silver, featureless head and hands stands on the right, dressed in a white, long-sleeved top with its arms crossed. As the scene expands, a second humanoid figure appears on the left, facing the first. This figure is dressed in a grey, long-sleeved top featuring a collar and a tie, and also has a reflective, silver, featureless head and hands. It holds its arms out with its palms open in a conversational gesture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene is set in a market against a wall of white and red tiles. A large poster advertising coffee in a white mug for $1.99 hangs on the wall. Below the advertisement, wooden crates display various types of produce, including sweet potatoes, red apples, and dark, round vegetables. To the right of the produce stands a plain grey door with a small, completely dark rectangular window near the top. Two figures are seen interacting in front of the produce bins.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with part of a human figure on the left side of the frame. As the camera trucks left, the full human figure is revealed, and another figure is also introduced. Both are shown in medium shots.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a humanoid figure in white standing on the right side of the frame. In the foreground, wooden produce bins are visible at the bottom, while a coffee poster and a grey door occupy the background on the right. The camera then trucks left, expanding the view to include a second humanoid figure in grey, who appears on the left side of the frame. The final composition is a medium shot showing both figures in the middle ground, with the grey figure on the left and the white figure on the right. The produce bins span the bottom foreground, and the tiled wall with the poster and door forms the background. The camera remains at the subjects' level.",
