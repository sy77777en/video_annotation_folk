    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens in a spacious, sunlit loft filled with sleek, futuristic objects. In the foreground, a dark-topped table holds retro-tech audio equipment. A pair of large, bronze gramophone-style horns stands in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, and to the left, a large, curved metal sculpture resembling a slide is present. In the center, a small, circular aircraft flies out of the window. The camera then pans right to reveal a transparent, holographic desktop screen mounted on a silver cylindrical base with multiple sockets for illuminated USB drives in pink, orange, blue, and white. The screen displays an incoming call notification from \"Johnny Nixon,\" shown in orange text above a circular emblem of a skull and crossbones. The background of the notification is a video feed depicting a light-skinned man dressed in white, hanging upside down from a cable high above a cityscape, with a floating wooden board resembling an aircraft behind him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a scene set within a spacious, modern loft apartment, either at sunrise or sunset, as golden light streams through large, floor-to-ceiling windows, offering a panoramic view of a sprawling city skyline. The room features a concrete floor, a large, bronze-colored abstract sculpture, and vintage gramophone horns. One of the windows is broken, and a small, silver, ring-shaped drone exits the room through this broken window. In the foreground, a transparent, holographic screen on a desk activates, displaying a call notification with the name \"Johnny Nixon,\" a skull and crossbones icon, the word \"Incoming,\" and a video feed showing a person hanging upside down from a rope next to a tall building against a blue sky.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video shows a first-person perspective game where the player starts by looking at a sunlit room with futuristic gadgets and a big window revealing a futuristic cityscape outside. The camera then unsteadily pans left to a holographic desktop screen displaying an incoming call from \"Johnny Nixon.\"",
    "pre_caption": "This video begins with a wide, first-person perspective shot looking out from a sunlit room. A desk with futuristic gadgets occupies the foreground across the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a large, curved sculpture is on the left, and two gramophone horns are positioned in the center-right. A small, circular aircraft flies from the upper center of the room into the background, exiting through a large window that displays a cityscape. The camera then pans unsteadily to the right, settling on a holographic desktop screen that fills the center-right foreground. On this screen, an incoming call notification is displayed, with text at the top center and a skull icon in the middle, all overlaid on a video feed showing a person hanging upside down on the left against a cityscape background. The loft interior and the window view remain visible in the background to the left of the screen. The camera is positioned at eye-level.",
