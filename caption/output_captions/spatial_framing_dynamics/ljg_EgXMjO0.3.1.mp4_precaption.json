    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This black-and-white, scratchboard-style animation features a dark, angular house situated on a hill against a dark sky. The house is a simple silhouette with a steep roof and a single, small, illuminated square window. The hill is rendered with a dense texture of white, wavy lines, creating a sense of uneven ground, with a winding path leading up to the house. The sky is filled with lumpy, stylized clouds, also drawn with white lines. The scene flashes and deconstructs, breaking the house and landscape apart into fleeting abstract lines and shapes, with the lit window often being the most persistent element visible in the darkness.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a black-and-white, chalk-style animation, a dark, angular house sits atop a hill under a cloudy night sky. A winding path, rendered with textured white lines, ascends the hill toward the structure. The house is presented in silhouette, with the exception of a single, small, illuminated square window on an upper level. The sky is filled with large, dark, puffy clouds outlined in white. The scene is interrupted by rapid, strobing flashes that momentarily reduce the image to just the lit window and a few abstract lines against a black background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "Initially, a dark house is positioned in the center-top middle ground, sitting on a hill that occupies the bottom and center of the frame, stretching from the foreground to the middle ground. A winding path is depicted on the hill in the foreground and middle ground, with clouds in the top-left and top-right background. The scene then rapidly flashes, causing the entire composition to deconstruct into fleeting abstract white lines against a black background. During these flashes, the most persistent element is the house's small, illuminated window, which maintains its center-top position while the rest of the scene fragments. The original image of the house on the hill flickers back into view intermittently between these deconstructions. The camera is positioned below the house, looking up at it.",
