    "pre_caption": "The video uses an extreme wide shot to capture a city square at night, with no main subject but several prominent architectural elements. The ornate fountain is centrally positioned in the frame and occupies the foreground and middle ground, rising vertically from the bottom center to the upper center of the image. The Ferris wheel is located in the background, initially appearing toward the left and then moving further into the center as the camera pans slightly, with its circular form and lights spanning from the left middle ground to the upper background. The Eiffel Tower is visible in the far background on the left side at the start, while a tall obelisk stands in the middle ground, slightly left of center. Artificial lights are scattered across the lower and middle portions of the frame, creating starburst effects in the foreground and middle ground. The camera is positioned at a low angle, slightly below the height of the fountain, emphasizing the scale of the structures and allowing the night sky and clouds to fill the upper background. The watermark \"MATHIEU STANIC\" is overlaid in the bottom right corner and does not interact with the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban environment at night. The scene features a grand, ornately decorated fountain with intricate sculptures and golden accents, illuminated by artificial lighting that highlights its architectural details. In the background, a large Ferris wheel adorned with colorful lights adds a dynamic and festive atmosphere, while the night sky and scattered clouds contribute to the overall ambiance. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is on the interplay of architectural elements, lighting, and the lively city atmosphere rather than any specific object or individual. The emphasis is on the environment and the sense of scale and vibrancy within the urban setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors at night in a city square, featuring a large, ornate fountain with multiple tiers and sculpted figures at its base. The fountain is illuminated by golden and white lights, highlighting its detailed carvings and smooth, reflective surfaces. Surrounding the fountain is a raised platform, reflecting the lights from nearby sources. In the background, the Eiffel Tower is visible at the beginning of the video, along with a tall obelisk and a brightly lit Ferris wheel with a circular shape and multicolored lights, adding to the urban atmosphere. The sky is dark with scattered clouds, and artificial lights create starburst effects around the square. Overlay elements include a watermark with the text \"MATHIEU STANIC\" in white, located in the lower right corner, which is not part of the scene itself.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
