    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot where a black sports car occupies the foreground, positioned from the bottom left to the center of the frame. In the middle ground, a silver sedan is to the left, a red and silver car is further back on the right, and a large stone building extends across the scene behind them. The camera, initially at the level of the cars, executes a rapid upward tilt. This movement causes the cars and the lower part of the stone building to move down and exit the frame from the bottom. The final composition becomes a low-angle shot, with the top of the stone building now at the bottom of the frame, while a tall, blue glass skyscraper from the background rises to fill the center and upper portions of the view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black, two-door sports car is stationary on the road in the foreground, facing left. In the midground, a silver sedan is oriented in the opposite direction. Further down the street, a sedan with a red and silver color scheme is parked. Both the silver sedan and the red-and-silver sedan are parked in front of a large, multi-story building constructed from grey stone blocks, featuring red awnings above the first-floor windows. The camera then tilts sharply upward, causing the cars and the stone building to disappear from view at the bottom of the screen. The final shot focuses exclusively on the tall, modern skyscraper with a blue-tinted glass facade that rises behind the stone building.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins at eye level in a city, where a black sports car is stationary near the road. Adjacent to the street stands a large, classical-style stone building with multiple stories, an arched structure, and red awnings above the ground-floor windows. The perspective then tilts upward, revealing a towering, modern skyscraper with a blue glass facade that rises high into the overcast sky, standing behind the older structure.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
