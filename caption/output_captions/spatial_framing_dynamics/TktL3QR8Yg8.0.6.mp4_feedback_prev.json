    "pre_caption": "An extreme close-up shot initially focuses on a hand in the center foreground, holding a flat metal piece over a drawing in the middle ground. A small blue eraser is positioned in the bottom left of the frame. The hand lifts the metal piece up and out of the frame, causing the focus to shift to the drawing, which now occupies the center of the frame. In the final composition, the drawing is in sharp focus in the middle ground, with other similar drawings visible in the blurred background. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person's hand with a light skin tone picks up a flat, elongated metal piece with a brushed texture and four holes from the table. The drawing on the table is a stylized, creature-like figure with a long, dark body, large, hollow eyes, and spindly limbs with hints of red on the feet. On the left side of the frame, both a white and a light blue rectangular eraser are visible on the paper.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting, a hand picks up a small, flat metal piece with four holes from the table with the drawing. The drawing is a sketchy figure rendered in black charcoal with red accents. Two erasers, one light blue and one white, are visible on the paper. As the hand lifts the metal piece, the focus transitions entirely to the drawing, revealing the figure's large, dark eyes and a wide, dark mouth. Other similar drawings are visible in the blurred background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
