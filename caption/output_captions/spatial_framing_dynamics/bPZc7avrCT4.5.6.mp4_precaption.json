    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a man in a blue t-shirt, dark shorts, and a backward red baseball cap, who is in the process of popping a purple water balloon with a knife held in both hands, causing water to splash around him. To his left, three other men are watching. The man on the right of the group has a beard and wears a white graphic t-shirt, dark shorts, and a light-colored hat, standing with his arms raised. Next to him stands a man in a white t-shirt, dark shorts, and glasses. A third man with a beard is partially visible on the far left. Two pieces of red, deflated balloons are also visible falling in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place on a sunny day in a backyard with a paved surface in the foreground. The area is enclosed by a dense background of lush green trees and foliage, with ivy seen climbing one of the tree trunks. Visible in the background are stacked wooden pallets and a few cinder blocks. A purple water balloon is captured at the moment of impact, bursting into a spray of water droplets that catch the sunlight. Two deflated, red balloons are also visible in the air.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a man is positioned on the right side of the frame in the middle ground, captured at the moment a purple water balloon he is holding bursts, creating a spray of water around him. To his left, also in the middle ground, three other men stand watching, with the man in the center of this group holding his arms up. Two red, deflated balloons are visible falling in the center of the frame, between the two groups of men. The background is composed of dense green trees, with stacked wooden pallets visible in the center-left background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
