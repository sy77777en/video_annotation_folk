    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a man in a blue t-shirt, dark shorts, and a backward red baseball cap, who is in the process of popping a purple water balloon with a knife held in both hands, causing water to splash around him. Positioned to the left of the frame are three other men watching. The man in the center of the group has a beard and wears a white graphic t-shirt, dark shorts, and a light-colored hat, standing with his arms raised. Next to him stands a man in a white t-shirt, dark shorts, and glasses. A third man with a beard is partially visible on the far left. Two pieces of a red, deflated balloon are visible in the middle ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place on a sunny day in a backyard, with a paved surface in the mid-ground. The area is enclosed by a dense background of lush green trees and foliage, with ivy seen climbing one of the tree trunks. In the background, a wooden ladder and a few cinder blocks are visible. A purple water balloon is captured at the moment of impact, bursting into a spray of water droplets that catch the sunlight. Two deflated red balloons are also visible in the air.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium full shot, filmed at the subjects' level, frames a man in a blue shirt in the right-middle ground as he pops a purple water balloon, which is positioned directly above his hands. The resulting splash of water expands outward from the point of impact around him in the middle ground. To his left, three other men stand in the middle ground: one in a white hat is positioned center-left, another in glasses is to the left, and a third man is partially visible on the far left. Two pieces of a red, deflated balloon are suspended in the air in the center of the middle ground. The background is filled with dense green trees.",
