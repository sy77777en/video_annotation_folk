    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a serene landscape, featuring a tranquil expanse of water with small, scattered landmasses in the foreground. In the distance, a lush green plain stretches out, leading to faint, undulating hills on the horizon. The sky is a soft pink, gently reflecting on the water's surface, while relatively thick clouds layer one upon another. This composition emphasizes the vastness and calmness of the environment, allowing viewers to appreciate the harmonious blend of natural elements and creating a peaceful, contemplative mood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an expansive body of still water under a twilight sky filled with soft, layered clouds tinged with pink and lavender. A narrow, earthen spit of land extends into the water, with numerous small, dark, elongated boats docked along its sides. A few low, dark structures are situated on this spit. The water's surface mirrors the subdued colors of the sky. In the distance, beyond the water's surface, there is a vast expanse of green land. Further beyond this land, a hazy landmass with low mountains lines the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures an expansive waterscape under a twilight sky. A narrow, earthen spit of land, with numerous small boats docked along its sides and a few low structures, extends from the bottom center towards the center of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground. Smaller, detached landmasses are visible to its left and right in the middle ground. The vast body of still water surrounds these land features, filling the foreground and middle ground and reflecting the soft pink and lavender hues of the layered clouds in the sky, which occupies the top third of the frame in the background. In the distant background, a wide expanse of green land stretches horizontally, with a hazy line of low mountains on the far horizon. The camera performs a slow, subtle lateral pan to the left, causing the central spit of land and the elements on it to gradually shift slightly towards the right side of the frame. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down on the scene.",
