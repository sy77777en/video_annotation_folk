    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person point of view, a person with light-skinned, bare feet is seen walking forward. They are wearing loose-fitting, blue pants that cover their legs down to the ankles. The person is walking on a brown, textured carpet in a dimly lit environment, with a warm light source casting a large, dark shadow of their legs and body onto the floor in front of them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, looks down at a pair of bare feet walking across a carpeted floor. The indoor setting is dimly lit by a warm, orange-hued light source, which casts a large, dark shadow of the person onto the beige, short-pile carpet. The individual is wearing loose-fitting blue pants as they take slow steps forward.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, a pair of bare feet and the lower portion of blue pants are positioned in the bottom center foreground. A large, dark shadow of the person is cast from the bottom of the frame, extending into the center and left middle ground. The subject walks forward on a brown carpet that fills the entire frame, with a warm light source illuminating the center and right side. As the person moves, the entire frame glides forward, with the feet taking alternating steps at the bottom of the screen, while the camera maintains its high, downward-looking angle.",
