    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video highlights a white sedan, with the camera focused on the car's door, capturing both the interior and exterior. The door features a black side mirror and is attached to a car with a tan or light brown interior. As the door swings shut, a faint and indistinct reflection of a person's face briefly appears in the side mirror, showing the front of the face, but no other specific details are discernible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot captures the static vehicle at night. The camera, mounted on the door, focuses on the black side mirror, reflecting the dimly lit surroundings. The footage shows the white, paneled garage door and a brick wall moving past with motion blur. The car's tan interior, including the dashboard and door, is visible, and the video clearly shows the door being closed, offering a detailed view of both the car's interior and its surroundings.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is fixed on the car door, showing it closing. The side mirror and part of the car frame are centered, with the focus initially on the front of the car. As the door closes, the front of the car exits the frame, revealing part of the surroundings. At the end, a faint reflection of a face appears in the side mirror, suggesting that the person is sitting in the driver's seat and has just closed the door.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot is fixed to a car door, initially framing the front of the white vehicle in the bottom left foreground against a white, paneled garage door in the background. The car's side mirror is in the center, with the tan interior occupying the right foreground. As the door swings shut, the camera pans swiftly from left to right, causing the garage door and a passing brick wall in the middle ground to blur and exit the frame on the left. The front of the car also moves out of the bottom left. The shot settles with the door closed, positioning the side mirror in the center of the frame and the car's interior on the right. A faint reflection of a face appears in the center of the mirror, which now reflects the static background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
