    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot of a tranquil, snowy rural area in winter. The video lacks a single main subject, as the focus is on the expansive, wintry environment and the atmosphere of quiet isolation rather than a specific person or object. The scene is captured from an eye-level perspective, beginning with an extreme wide shot where a snow-covered path occupies the foreground from the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a red house and smaller buildings are positioned on the right, with a vast snowy field stretching across the center and left. A dark forest on a hill fills the background. The camera then zooms in, transitioning to a wide shot that reframes the composition to focus on the middle ground. In this closer view, several white, circular yurts are now prominent in the center and left of the frame, with a small brown shed to their right, while the forest remains in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot of a tranquil, snowy rural area in winter. The video lacks a single main subject, as the focus is on the expansive, wintry environment and the atmosphere of quiet isolation rather than a specific person or object. A vast, snow-covered field stretches across the foreground and mid-ground under a gray, overcast sky, with snowflakes visibly falling. In the mid-ground, a cluster of white, circular yurts with conical roofs sits near a traditional red wooden house and a few smaller sheds, all blanketed in snow. A dark, dense forest of trees lines a distant hill, completing the serene and cold winter tableau.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An extreme wide shot captures a rural landscape blanketed in snow under a grey, overcast sky while light snow falls. In the foreground and middleground, a vast, white field stretches out, with a snow-covered path visible from the bottom left to the center right. This path disappears as the camera zooms in. A cluster of buildings, including a prominent red wooden house and smaller outbuildings, sits on the edge of the field. Circular yurts, a small brown wooden shed, and additional wooden houses are scattered throughout the field. In the far distance, a dark forest of pine trees lines a hill.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
