    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, eye-level view of a pixelated computer interface that fills the entire frame. Initially, the central area of the screen displays a webpage with green text on a dark background. A white arrow cursor is positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the text. The view then transitions to a search results page within the same window frame, where the cursor moves from the top left to the center to click on a link. The final view shows a new page where the words \"ILLEGAL CONTENT\" are centered in the upper-middle portion of the frame. Below this text, three identical images of angels are arranged horizontally across the center of the screen. The cursor remains on the right side of the frame. Throughout the video, the main window remains fixed, with only its internal content changing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases a user navigating a pixelated computer interface with a purple and green color scheme, reminiscent of a late 1990s operating system. The user explores a fictional internet called \"Hypnospace Explorer,\" moving from a personal homepage to a search results page after looking up \"badguy.\" This leads to a page with the heading \"ILLEGAL CONTENT\" in red, pixelated text. On this page are three animated, pixelated images of young, light-skinned girls standing in a row, each dressed as an angel. They all have golden hair, white halos, and large white wings, and are wearing long, flowing gowns. The girl on the far left is holding a basket of flowers in her right hand, the one in the middle holds a dove in each hand, and the girl on the far right has her hands gently lowered at her sides. The page also displays text that sarcastically identifies the creator and provides a name and address.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a software or system interface shows a user navigating a retro, pixelated operating system with a purple and blue border and interior pages featuring a black background. The main window, titled \"HYPNOSPACE EXPLORER,\" initially displays the \"Home Page of Dylan Merchant,\" which features green text on a dark background discussing an audio player called \"DM_Tunebox\" and a \"SECRET PROJECT.\" A white arrow cursor navigates the screen, performing a search for the term \"badguy.\" The search results lead to a new page with a slim rectangular block in red and brown at the top, displaying \"NO VIOLATION POINTS\" on one end and \"MODEL CITIZEN\" on the other. Below this, the page displays the words \"ILLEGAL CONTENT\" in large red letters above three pixelated images of angels on a black background. The system's top bar shows the date as \"1999.11.05.\" Tags such as \"hypnospace,\" \"illegalcontent,\" and \"badguy\" are visible in a sidebar on the different pages.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
