    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, capturing the natural beauty and tranquility of the scene. The emphasis is on the overall mood created by the sunset, trees, and open field, rather than any specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene during sunset, featuring a serene landscape with a prominent tree in the foreground. The setting is a grassy field with a few scattered trees in the distance. The sky is painted with warm hues as the sun sets on the horizon, casting a gentle glow over the scene. The environment is calm, with no visible movement, emphasizing the natural beauty of the landscape. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, with the sun's rays filtering through the tree branches, creating a picturesque view.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a serene landscape during sunset. The camera remains stationary throughout, capturing the expansive scenery. A prominent tree occupies the left side of the frame, positioned in the foreground. Its branches extend across the upper portion of the scene, partially silhouetted against the glowing sky. In the middle ground, a grassy field stretches horizontally, leading towards the horizon. A few scattered trees are visible in the background, positioned towards the right side of the frame. The sun is near the horizon, located slightly off-center to the right, casting warm light across the scene. The camera's height is level with the tree, providing a clear view of the landscape. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of elements within the video.",
