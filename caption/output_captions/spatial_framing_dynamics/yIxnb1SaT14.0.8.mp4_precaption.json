    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a nighttime cityscape scenery shot, focusing on capturing the overall environment, atmosphere, and scale of the Parisian scene along the River Seine at night. The composition encompasses the river reflecting numerous lights, bordered by illuminated stone embankments and multi-story traditional buildings with glowing windows. In the distance, the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral is prominently featured, illuminated against the dark sky near a bridge. Five brightly lit tour boats with blue decorative lights travel consecutively along the water, passing under the bridge and adding dynamism to the scene rather than being its primary focus. The emphasis is on the collective visual experience and mood of the location rather than highlighting one specific element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This nighttime scene captures the Seine River in Paris, with the illuminated Notre Dame Cathedral visible in the distance beyond a stone arch bridge. The river flows between light-colored stone embankments, which are lined with multi-story buildings featuring lit windows and yellow streetlights. Five long tour boats, decorated with blue lights, travel consecutively along the water, passing under the bridge and creating a blur with their movement. The various city lights cast shimmering reflections on the dark surface of the river. A text overlay in the bottom right corner reads \"MATHIEU STANI\u0106 CINEMATOGRAPHER\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a nighttime cityscape scenery. The Seine River flows from the foreground through the center of the frame, leading toward the Notre Dame Cathedral, which is positioned in the center background. The river is flanked by illuminated buildings on the left and right sides, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. A bridge spans the river in the middle ground, in front of the cathedral. A series of tour boats, appearing as a motion-blurred streak of blue light, travels along the river from the bottom right foreground toward the center. The static camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down on the scene, and a text overlay is visible in the bottom right corner.",
