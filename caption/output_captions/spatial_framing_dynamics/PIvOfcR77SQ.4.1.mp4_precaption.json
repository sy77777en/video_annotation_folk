    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a stunning winter landscape, focusing on the snowy environment and surrounding trees. In addition to the natural scenery, a large, single-story house covered in snow is prominently featured, enhancing the sense of place and mood. The expansive view of the snow-covered ground, trees, and house highlights the natural beauty and scale of the winter setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a serene winter scene in a snowy, forested area. Tall evergreen trees with dark green foliage surround the setting, their trunks partially covered in snow. The ground is blanketed in a thick layer of snow, creating a smooth, white surface. A snowplow is visible, suggesting recent clearing activity. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the landscape, with light snowfall gently descending. A wooden cabin with a sloped roof, also covered in snow, is present, and a small vehicle is parked nearby. The overall atmosphere is calm and quiet, typical of a winter day in a remote, wooded area.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a snowy winter landscape, capturing an expansive view of the environment. Initially, the camera focuses on a snowplow in the middle ground, positioned slightly off-center towards the left side of the frame. The plow is surrounded by tall evergreen trees in the background, which dominate the upper portion of the scene. As the video progresses, the camera pans to the right, transitioning smoothly from the initial focus on the snowplow to a large, single-story house situated in the middle ground. This house occupies the central-right portion of the frame, with its sloped roof and wooden structure clearly visible. The house is flanked by more snow-covered trees in the background, maintaining a consistent presence throughout the scene. The camera remains at a level height relative to the ground, providing a continuous and stable perspective of the snowy terrain, which stretches across the foreground and middle ground. The spatial composition shifts subtly as the camera moves, emphasizing different elements while preserving the overall serene and expansive feel of the winter setting.",
