    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A male video game character is shown from an isometric perspective in a dark, outdoor environment. The character has a pixelated, low-resolution appearance and wears a red and black top with white long sleeves, dark pants, and red boots. He holds a round shield in his left hand. A user interface is present at the bottom of the screen, featuring a large red orb on the left, a large blue orb on the right, and a central bar with icons. A translucent, glowing red path materializes on the ground, extending from near the character towards a stone building with a glowing red doorway.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows the environment in a three-quarters perspective. The scene is set at night in a gloomy, rural landscape with dark green and brown terrain crisscrossed by dark red paths. A small, rustic hut with a thatched roof and log walls stands on the left, while low, broken stone walls and gnarled trees are scattered throughout the area. As a character walks across the screen, a larger stone building with a rounded wall and a glowing red entrance becomes visible in the upper right. A shimmering red trail materializes on the ground, leading the way to this entrance. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays a user interface with a red orb on the left, a blue orb on the right, an inventory/equipment bar in the middle, and several labeled buttons positioned at the far sides.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot, filmed from a tilted overhead isometric perspective, initially shows a male video game character in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. To his left, also in the middle ground, is a small hut, while a user interface occupies the foreground at the bottom of the screen. The character walks from the center towards the top right, and as he moves, a glowing red path materializes on the ground before him, leading towards a larger stone building that comes into view in the top right middle ground. The camera pans slightly to the right to follow the character's movement, maintaining its high-angle, isometric view throughout the shot.",
