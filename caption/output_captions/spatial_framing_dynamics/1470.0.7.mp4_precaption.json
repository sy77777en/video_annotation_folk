    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person with a light skin tone and short, slightly wavy reddish-brown hair. They are wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and dark pants, holding a black book or folder under their arm. They stand facing a glass door. Their posture is upright, and they appear to be focused on the door.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting in front of a house with yellow siding and large, reflective windows. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as indicated by the warm, natural lighting casting soft shadows. The house features a distinctive grid-patterned glass window and a sloped roof. The environment is calm, with no visible movement. The presence of strong sunlight suggests it is a clear, sunny day, and the overall atmosphere is serene, with the architecture and lighting creating a harmonious visual composition.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video shows a medium full shot of a person standing outdoors in front of a house with yellow siding and large, reflective windows. The subject, positioned on the right side of the frame in the foreground, faces a glass door directly ahead. They hold a black book or folder under their arm. Their reflection is visible in the glass door, appearing on the left side of the frame. The subject remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining an upright posture and focus on the door. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing their full body from the knees up. The background includes the house's yellow siding and grid-patterned glass windows, which remain static. There are no changes in shot size, position, or camera height during the video. The spatial framing consistently places the subject in the foreground, with the house and its windows forming the backdrop.",
