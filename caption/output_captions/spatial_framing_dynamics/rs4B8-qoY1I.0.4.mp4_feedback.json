    "pre_caption": "This video uses a wide shot, capturing the entirety of an isometric game room from a tilted overhead angle. A tall, winding structure is positioned in the center middle ground. An ornate archway stands on the left middle ground. The walls, featuring alcoves with static figures, define the background along the top and right edges of the frame. The checkered floor occupies the foreground and middle ground. A white, ghost-like figure begins near the central structure in the middle ground and moves towards the right middle ground. Two cone-shaped objects are initially seen near the center middle ground before moving towards the right middle ground. An orange and white cube is located in the bottom right middle ground. Game interface elements are overlaid across the bottom foreground. The camera position and framing remain fixed throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases an isometric game environment with a distinct, limited color palette primarily featuring black, white, orange, and teal. A prominent, atypical structure dominates the center, constructed from stacked orange and white segments resembling a spine, crowned with arched details and a white, ghost-like figure. The main character is a cartoon dog with large eyes and a simple, round form. Static, green, masked figures stand within alcoves along the walls, appearing as stylized guards or statues. Peculiar orange, cone-shaped objects with white bases and jagged tops are moving on the checkered floor. An ornate, striped archway serves as an entrance or exit on the left. An orange and white cube is located in the right corner. The scene's overall appearance is defined by its retro, pixelated graphic style and isometric perspective, creating a non-realistic, stylized world.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows an indoor room rendered in a pixelated style using orange, white, teal, and black. The environment features a black and teal checkered floor and walls made of white structures lined with teal shelves holding small, teal figures, all accented with orange. A white and orange striped archway serves as an entrance on the left. A tall, winding orange and white structure dominates the center. Throughout the video, a white, ghost-like character moves across the room, starting near the central structure and heading right. Two orange and white cone-shaped objects with faces appear, initially near the center and later near the right wall, wandering aimlessly without any apparent pattern. Overlays forming a heads-up display (HUD) are visible at the bottom, showing icons for game items (keys, skulls, springs, boxes, a device) and corresponding numbers (23, 80, 15, 15, 0, 0, 0).**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
