    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a pixelated, dark blue cave-like environment with glowing turquoise accents resembling vines or water streams. The main subject is a small, light grey, circular character with a simple design, featuring two white circular eyes, navigating through the scene. This character moves vertically and horizontally, interacting with the environment. The setting includes platforms and walls that are dark blue or black with a digital, grid-like texture, creating a maze-like structure. The overall aesthetic is reminiscent of retro video games, with a focus on exploration and movement within the confined space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile, displays a dark, cavernous environment with a pixelated art style. The setting is composed of dark blue and black platforms and walls with a grid-like texture, forming a maze-like structure with vertical shafts. At the top of the scene, glowing cyan vines hang down and sway gently. A digital waterfall, represented by descending vertical blue lines, flows down the center. A small, white, circular dome with a candle lamp inside hangs from the center top, while a gray, circular character is seen jumping below. The scene features overlay elements, including a white and blue icon in the bottom-left corner and four pink, heart-shaped icons in the bottom-right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot presents a static, side-view perspective of a pixelated, cavernous environment. The scene is composed of a maze-like structure of dark platforms and walls that occupy the middle ground. In the foreground, a white icon is fixed in the bottom-left corner, and four pink heart icons are in the bottom-right corner. A small, circular character begins in the lower-center of the frame. It then jumps upwards and to the right, landing on a platform in the center-right area of the scene. Throughout the shot, glowing turquoise vines hang from the top of the frame, and a digital waterfall descends through the center.",
