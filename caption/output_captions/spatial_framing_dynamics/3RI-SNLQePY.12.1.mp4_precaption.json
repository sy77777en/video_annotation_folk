    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a pixel art scene with a blue-grey blob with eyes, initially positioned on the right side. This blob moves to the left, illuminating a circular area around it. The rest of the scene remains obscured. Towards the end, the blob jumps a few times. There is a small amount of water in the bottom left corner of the screen, creating a reflection of the blob and its surroundings. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a dark, cavernous environment with a pixel art aesthetic. The background is almost entirely black, with platforms and structures outlined in dark blue and purple. A small, white, orb-like character jumps between these platforms. Scattered throughout the environment are small, plant-like objects, with one in the bottom left illuminated by a nearby light source. The scene includes overlay elements: a square icon with a magnifying glass inside and a smaller blue square icon containing an \"X\" are in the bottom left corner, while four small, pinkish-red heart icons are visible in the bottom right, with three filled and one just an outline.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot from a side-on perspective, the scene is a dark environment with fragmented platforms. UI elements are positioned in the foreground at the bottom left and bottom right corners. A character appears in the middle ground on the right side of the frame and moves horizontally to the left, its movement illuminating the immediate surroundings. It passes behind a foreground platform in the bottom left before jumping up onto it. The character then performs a few small jumps on this platform, with its reflection visible in the water at the very bottom of the frame. The camera remains static throughout the sequence.",
