    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a white man in a room filled with screens. He is wearing black pants, a gray hoodie, a necklace, and has short hair. The focus is on his interaction with the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot set in a dimly lit indoor environment, characterized by a futuristic and abstract aesthetic. The scene is dominated by a variety of glowing, neon-colored elements that create a surreal atmosphere. The lighting is primarily blue and purple, casting an otherworldly glow over the surroundings. The setting appears to be filled with digital or holographic displays, contributing to a high-tech ambiance. The overall mood is enhanced by the dynamic interplay of light and shadow, with the neon elements providing the primary source of illumination. The scene transitions smoothly, maintaining a consistent color scheme and visual style throughout.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video takes place in a room filled with screens. A person walks toward the camera and then punches it. The shot size transitions from no subject at the beginning to a full shot when the person appears, then to a middle shot as he punch the camera, and finally back to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a dimly lit room filled with screens, creating a futuristic ambiance. Initially, there is no major subject, and the focus is on the abstract, neon-colored elements in the background. As the video progresses, a person enters the scene from the background, moving toward the camera, which is positioned at the subject's height. The shot transitions from a full shot to a middle shot as the person approaches and interacts with the camera by punching it. The subject is centrally positioned, moving from the background to the foreground. The neon elements remain in the background, providing a consistent high-tech atmosphere. After the interaction, the shot returns to a full shot, maintaining the room's immersive and surreal environment.",
