    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape. Initially, a bay featuring turquoise water near its light-colored shore, which transitions to deep blue further out, is positioned in the center and middle ground. Arid, brown landmasses are in the foreground, framing the bay from the bottom left and bottom right. Within the bay, a larger white yacht is located in its upper right portion (middle ground), a smaller sailboat is near the center of the bay (middle ground), and a third, more distant small boat is visible in the deep blue water towards the top right of the frame (background). The camera then slowly ascends and tilts upwards. This movement causes the foreground land to occupy less of the bottom frame, expanding the view to reveal more of the deep blue sea in the background and distant landforms appearing along the top edge of the frame. All elements within the scene become progressively smaller as the camera gains altitude from its high aerial perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an aerial coastal landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the expansive natural environment, showcasing the contrast between the arid, rocky landmasses and the vibrant turquoise and deep blue waters of the bay, rather than on any specific object. The few boats present are small elements within the vastness of the scene, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere of the location.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of a bay where turquoise water near a light-colored shore transitions to deep blue further out. Arid, brown, rocky land with sparse vegetation forms the coastline of the bay. Three white boats, including a larger yacht and two smaller sailboats, are anchored in the water. The drone slowly ascends, revealing more of the expansive bay and distant landforms under a clear, sunny sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
