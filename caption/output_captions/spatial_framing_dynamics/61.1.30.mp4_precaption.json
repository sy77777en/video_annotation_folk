    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man wearing a white uniform with short sleeves and a matching white cap with a red stripe. He has a medium skin tone, short dark hair, and is wearing glasses. The man is positioned in a dimly lit setting, and his facial hair is neatly trimmed. In the video, he is seen raising his arm and flexing his bicep, appearing to dance very relaxedly. The lighting casts a warm glow, highlighting his profile and the details of his attire.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, dimly lit ambiance, likely during the evening. The environment features a room with striped curtains and a hanging light fixture that casts a soft glow. The walls and decor suggest a retro or vintage style, with muted colors and a cozy atmosphere. A person is present, wearing a white uniform and a hat, adding to the nostalgic feel of the scene. The lighting creates a mix of shadows and highlights, enhancing the intimate and slightly mysterious mood of the space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In this close-up shot, a man in a uniform is initially positioned slightly right of center in the middle ground. Behind him, striped curtains occupy the background across the top half of the frame, with a hanging light fixture in the top center middle ground. A green light source is visible in the left foreground, and a red neon light element is seen in the right middle ground/background. The man turns slightly to his left, moving towards the center-left of the frame while staying in the middle ground. The camera remains level with the subject.",
