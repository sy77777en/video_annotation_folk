    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with short, dark hair is shown in a dimly lit environment, rendered mostly in silhouette. They are wearing a dark, short-sleeved t-shirt. Throughout the video, the individual is bent over at the waist, with their back and shoulders primarily facing the viewer. Their face remains obscured due to their posture and the low lighting. The person is engaged in a physical action, appearing to struggle with or move an unseen object on the floor.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit room, the lower half of a wall is covered in green and white checkered wallpaper, with a small, framed picture of a person blowing a bubble hanging on it. In the background, a red curtain is partially visible, and a small shelf is mounted on the far wall. A person in a dark t-shirt is bent over in the foreground, their form mostly in shadow as they move a metal-framed object across the floor. The low lighting casts deep shadows throughout the space.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a person positioned in the center foreground, bent over. On the left side of the frame, a picture hangs on a checkered wall in the middle ground. In the background, a small shelf is visible in the center-right, with a red curtain on the far right. The person moves downward and slightly to the left, their back and head occupying the lower-center portion of the frame as they interact with an object on the floor. This movement causes their form to shift from the center to the bottom-center of the frame, altering the composition. The camera remains stationary and positioned at the subject's level throughout the action.",
