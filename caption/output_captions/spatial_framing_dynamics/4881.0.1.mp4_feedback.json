Superimposed in the foreground, large white text reading \"NAILS\" is centered, partially obscuring her. Additional text is located in the foreground at the top center and bottom center of the frame.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, dark, wavy hair is shown in profile, looking straight forward. She is wearing a dark top with sleeves. White, stylized text is superimposed over her figure. The largest word, \"NAILS,\" is written in a cursive font across the center of the scene. Smaller text above and below lists credits, including \"2048,\" \"SAINT LEVANT,\" and \"CREATED BY COMING OF AGE.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place at night inside a modern, dimly lit interior, possibly an office or studio. Long, dark-colored tables are arranged in the room, each featuring a small, contemporary lamp that casts a warm, focused glow. In the background, a single framed picture hangs on a wall beneath a brass-colored sconce, and a few lights are visible outside through a large window. A person with long, dark hair is seen in profile walking through the space. White text is overlaid on the scene: at the top center are the words \"2048\" inside a box and \"SAINT LEVANT\" below it. The word \"NAILS\" is written across the center in a large, stylized, cursive font. At the bottom, a block of smaller text lists production credits.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
