    "pre_caption": "This is a static, eye-level shot of a pixelated computer desktop interface. Initially, a \"HYPNOS INSTALLER\" window is positioned in the center foreground, displaying a progress bar over a surreal background scene in the middle ground. A column of icons occupies the left foreground, while an information bar runs across the top. After the installation completes, the central window closes. A paper cutout on a stick appears in the bottom-left foreground, while a pixelated professor character materializes in the bottom-right foreground. A dialogue box then pops up in the center-right foreground, next to the professor. This dialogue box is subsequently replaced by a larger window in the same center-right foreground position, displaying a book cover. The paper cutout and the professor remain stationary in their respective corners throughout the final part of the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A video game's pixelated desktop interface is shown, featuring a surreal, dark background with a large building and floating watermelons. An installation window for \"HYPNOS INSTALLER\" shows a blue progress bar completing the installation of \"Professor Helper.\" After the installation is complete, a pixelated character, an elderly man with glasses, a bald head with white side hair, and a brown suit with a red bowtie, appears on the right side of the screen. A dialogue box pops up next to him, asking if the user needs help. In the bottom left corner, a popsicle stick holds up a paper cutout of a simple, hand-drawn cartoon character. Subsequently, a new window appears, displaying the cover of a book titled \"BLOOD MONEY FROM THE TOP DOWN,\" which features a piggy bank overflowing with black liquid and cash.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a software or system interface features a surreal, pixelated desktop background depicting a dark, spooky landscape with a large, dark building under a reddish-purple sky, populated by ghost-like figures, floating watermelons, pills, and a dry tree holding a hotdog, a donut, and a slice of pie over a floating piece of dirt with roots below. Overlaid on this desktop is a user interface with a column of colorful icons on the left, behind which is a red human shape, and an information bar at the top. In the top left corner, there is a small pink note with \"phjhjkshjthhdjt\" written on it. In the center of the screen, a window for the \"HYPNOS INSTALLER\" shows the completed installation of \"Professor Helper.\" Subsequently, a pop-up dialog appears with a character offering help, followed by another window advertising a book titled \"BLOOD MONEY FROM THE TOP DOWN.\" An additional overlay in the lower-left corner shows a popsicle stick holding up a paper cutout of a cartoon character.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
