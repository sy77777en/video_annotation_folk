    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a woman, capturing her from the chest up. She is positioned slightly off-center to the left in the frame, with her body oriented towards a large, white, rectangular object located on the right side of the frame. This object, featuring a black panel and metallic controls, is in the foreground, indicating its proximity to the woman. Initially, her gaze is directed towards the object, placing her attention in the middle ground. As the video progresses, she turns her face towards the camera, shifting her gaze from the right side of the frame to the center. The camera remains at her eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. The background consists of plain, white walls, which remain static and unchanging. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera movement, keeping the focus on the woman and her interaction with the object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with short, dark hair, wearing a white, form-fitting outfit with orange stripes. Her attire includes a hood that covers most of her head, leaving her face visible. She has a fair skin tone and is positioned close to a large, white, rectangular object with a black panel and metallic controls, suggesting she is interacting with or observing it. Initially, her gaze is directed towards the object, but later in the video, she turns her face towards the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors, featuring a minimalist setting with plain, white walls. A person is present, wearing a white outfit with orange stripes and a hood, standing near a large, white, rectangular object with metallic controls. The lighting is bright and even, suggesting an artificial indoor light source.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
