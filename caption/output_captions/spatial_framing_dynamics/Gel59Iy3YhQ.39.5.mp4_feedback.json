    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, pixelated, dark character wearing a red top stands on the peak of a snowy, blueish-purple mountain. Above this figure, a white, rectangular speech bubble with a pointed tail appears, containing the black, pixelated, all-caps text \"CELLPHONE RECEPTION!!\". Subsequently, the text within the speech bubble changes to the lowercase word \"hello?\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a gaming video with a high-angle view, the scene is set on a snowy, blue-hued mountaintop at night. The pixelated sky features a large, solid blue moon that initially appears in the upper right but then goes out of frame as the camera moves. The sky is filled with a wavy aurora in shades of blue and teal against a purple backdrop. White pixels representing falling snow drift across the entire scene. Below the peak, a vast landscape stretches out in shades of purple and pink. An overlay of a white speech bubble appears above a character on the peak; the first speech bubble with the text \"CELLPHONE RECEPTION!!\" inside disappears, and another speech bubble appears sequentially with the text \"hello?\"**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
