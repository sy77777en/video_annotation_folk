    "pre_caption": "This video is shot from a first-person POV, beginning with a close-up where a hand is visible in the bottom left foreground, touching a music box that is centrally positioned. As the hand moves out of the frame, the camera tilts upward, transitioning into a medium shot that fully reveals the music box. The box occupies the center of the frame, with its base in the foreground and its open lid in the middle ground. A child's drawing is positioned in the left middle ground, while various out-of-focus toys are scattered across the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a light-skinned hand briefly touches the side of an open, antique-style music box before moving out of frame. The music box is made of dark wood with intricate, swirling carvings on its front panel, which also features an oval inlay with the initials \"DP\" in a script font. The interior has a reddish hue, revealing the music box's mechanism: a large, brass-colored, pinned cylinder and a steel comb. On the inside of the lid, a faded, sepia-toned photograph of a brightly lit carnival at night is taped, with a large Ferris wheel as its centerpiece. A small, aged ticket stub is tucked into the bottom left corner of the photograph. To the left of the music box is a child's crayon drawing of a smiling yellow sun and a Ferris wheel, while on the right side is a green puzzle-like object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, focuses on an open, antique-style wooden music box resting on a textured surface. The dark wood box features intricate carvings on its front panel, and the interior is a brownish-red color. Inside, a brass-colored cylinder with pins is positioned above a metal comb, and a crank handle is visible on the right. Taped to the inside of the open lid is a faded, sepia-toned photograph of a carnival at night, dominated by a large, illuminated Ferris wheel, alongside a small ticket stub. On the left side of the music box, there is a drawing of a smiling yellow sun and a Ferris wheel, while on the right side, there is a green, puzzle-like object. In the softly lit background, various out-of-focus toys can be seen, including colorful balls, building blocks, a train, and figurines.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video is shot from a first-person POV and begins with a close-up of a pair of hands operating a music box. As the hands move out of the frame, the camera tilts upward to show the music box and finally shows a medium shot of the music box.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
