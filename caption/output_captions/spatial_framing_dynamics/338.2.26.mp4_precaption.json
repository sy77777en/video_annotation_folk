    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a bustling restaurant scene. Initially, a man with short dark hair, wearing a light-colored short-sleeve shirt, is seen eating noodles. He is positioned in the foreground, holding chopsticks and a portable electric fan. In the background, other diners are visible, including a server in a maroon shirt standing and a woman with long hair seated at a table. The camera then pans to reveal a robotic vacuum cleaner on the patterned carpeted floor, moving amidst the dining area. Several tables are occupied by diners engaged in conversation, including a woman in a colorful sleeveless top and a man in a hat. The setting is lively, with a mix of seated patrons and waitstaff moving around.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor restaurant setting with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The environment features several round tables covered with white tablecloths, surrounded by red-cushioned chairs. The walls are adorned with large, intricate murals depicting scenes with earthy tones, adding a cultural touch to the space. As the camera pans left and tilts down, the focus transitions to the carpeted floor, which has a geometric pattern in shades of brown and red. Patrons are seated at tables, engaged in conversation and dining, creating a lively ambiance. A small, circular robotic device with a teal top moves across the floor, adding a modern element to the traditional setting. The lighting is soft and ambient, suggesting a cozy, relaxed time of day.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a restaurant scene with many customers. It begins with a medium close-up shot of a man eating noodles, with waitstaff and other diners in the background. The camera quickly pans left, revealing a robotic vacuum cleaner on the floor, surrounded by the dining area with many diners seated at tables.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up shot of a man eating noodles, positioned in the foreground and center of the frame. He holds chopsticks and a fan, with his upper body visible. The camera is at his eye level. In the background, the middle ground includes a server in a maroon shirt standing near the top right and other diners seated at tables. The background also features intricate wall murals and patterned carpets. The camera then pans left, transitioning from the man to a wider shot. This reveals a robotic vacuum cleaner in the bottom left of the frame, moving on the floor in the foreground. The vacuum cleaner is smaller in scale compared to the initial subject. The camera shifts to a higher angle, looking down at the floor. The dining area remains in the middle ground, with tables and diners scattered throughout. The camera movement provides a broader view of the restaurant, capturing the lively interaction among patrons and staff. The transition from the initial medium close-up to the wider shot effectively showcases the dynamic environment of the restaurant.",
