    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot of the bustling St. Mark's Square in Venice under a partly cloudy blue sky. The grand St. Mark's Basilica, an exemplary piece of Italo-Byzantine architecture, fills the middleground with its intricate facade, featuring multiple golden-topped domes, elaborate spires, and shimmering mosaics above its arched entrances. To the right, the towering, solid brick structure of St. Mark's Campanile rises high into the frame. The expansive paved square extends from the foreground to the middleground and is alive with the movement of numerous tourists strolling about, their long shadows stretching across the ground in the bright sunlight. The camera's wide perspective dynamically captures the overall atmosphere, architectural grandeur, and vibrant energy of this iconic public space, making the environment itself the focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A daytime scene captures the bustling St. Mark's Square in Venice, Italy, under a partly cloudy blue sky. In the center stands the ornate St. Mark's Basilica, a grand structure with multiple domes, some topped in gold, and a facade adorned with intricate arches and mosaics. To the right, a portion of the tall, reddish-brown brick St. Mark's Campanile is visible. The large, paved square is filled with numerous people walking in various directions, with some pigeons scattered on the ground. Scaffolding is present on an upper section of the basilica. To the left, other historical buildings line the square, and a construction crane is visible in the distant background.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide, static scenery shot captured from a standard eye-level height. The paved St. Mark's Square fills the foreground and bottom half of the frame, extending into the middle ground. Positioned centrally in the middle ground is the large St. Mark's Basilica. To its right, the tall St. Mark's Campanile rises from the middle ground and extends beyond the top of the frame. Other buildings line the square in the middle ground on the left, while a construction crane is visible in the background on the top left. The sky occupies the background at the top of the frame. Although the camera is stationary, the scene is dynamic due to the constant movement of numerous people walking in various directions across the square in the foreground and middle ground.",
