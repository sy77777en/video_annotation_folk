    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A blonde woman, wearing a red long-sleeved top, a white skirt, and a glowing blue necklace, is positioned on the left. She holds an elongated object, with the upper part being light green and the lower part transparent, and is depicted laughing with her hand covering her mouth, following an apparent discharge of water from the object. In the center, a man dressed in a black suit, white shirt, and a dark patterned tie, holds a small black and white stuffed animal; water is visible on his suit and face, and he has a surprised expression. To his right, a second man, also in a black suit and white shirt, with short dark hair and a light beard, reacts with an expression of surprise and amusement, leaning back slightly. Several pet tech gadgets are displayed on a table before them, notably a white and blue cylindrical device and a white rectangular dispenser with a wooden lid.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A television broadcast-style viewpoint shows an indoor studio setting. In the background, a large screen displays a bright daytime cityscape with a prominent palm tree. In the foreground, a white table holds several pet tech gadgets: a white and teal cylindrical device, a white rectangular object with a wooden lid, and a white circular water fountain. On the far left, a blonde woman holds a small, teal, elongated object from which a white foamy substance, identified as water, has just sprayed. In the center, a man in a dark suit is reacting to the spray, while on the far right, another person stands. Overlay elements include a \"Today\" logo with the time \"8:55\" displayed beneath it, and a banner in the lower left with \"PET TECH\" in dark blue text on a white background on the top line, and \"GADGETS TO TRACK & ENTERTAIN YOUR FURRY FRIENDS\" in smaller white text on a dark blue background on the bottom line. A yellow \"9\" logo is visible in the lower right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene opens with a medium full shot, which transitions to a medium shot, all captured from the subjects' eye level. A woman is positioned in the left middle ground, holding a light green object. In the center middle ground, a man holds a small stuffed animal, and to his right, another man stands in the right middle ground. A table displaying pet tech gadgets, including a white and blue cylindrical device and a white rectangular dispenser, occupies the foreground. A large screen displaying a cityscape forms the background. As the shot zooms into a medium shot, the woman on the left directs the object towards the man in the center, from which water sprays onto him. The woman then laughs, covering her mouth with her hand, remaining in her left position. The man in the center, now more prominent, reacts with a startled facial expression as water becomes visible on him, while the man on the right also shows a startled expression and leans backward slightly. Graphic overlays, including a \"Today PET TECH\" banner, are visible in the bottom left of the frame, and a \"9\" logo is in the bottom right.",
