    "pre_caption": "In this abstract shot, a stream of golden particles is positioned diagonally, flowing in a gentle arc from the top left of the frame towards the bottom right. The particles primarily occupy the middle ground, with a shallow depth of field creating a sense of dimension by blurring elements closer to and further from the focal plane. A faint light source is suggested off-screen in the top right, casting a subtle glow across the scene. The camera remains stationary, observing the continuous flow of particles from what appears to be a slightly elevated position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This abstract video showcases a flowing, curved stream of golden particles against a solid black background. The particles, which resemble glitter or dust, are of various sizes and shades of gold and yellow, with some appearing as bright, sparkling points of light. The stream moves in a gentle arc from the upper left towards the lower right. A shallow depth of field is employed, rendering some particles in sharp focus while others are softly blurred, creating a sense of dimension. A faint, warm light source in the upper right corner casts a subtle glow over the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a solid black background, a stream of shimmering golden particles flows in a gentle arc from the upper left towards the lower right. The particles, varying in size and brightness, create a sense of depth with a shallow focus, where some are sharp and others are softly blurred. A faint, warm light source is suggested off-screen in the upper right, casting a subtle glow on the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
