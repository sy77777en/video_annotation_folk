    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young man with light skin and short blond hair, wearing blue patterned swimming briefs. He is initially standing on a diving platform with his arms raised above his head, preparing to dive. The man is barefoot and has a black wristband on each wrist. The video captures his dive into a pool, culminating in a splash as he enters the water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors at a swimming facility, featuring a diving platform and a pool. The setting includes a diving board with metal railings and a spectator area with tiered seating. The environment is well-lit, suggesting an artificial lighting setup typical of indoor sports venues. The pool water is a vibrant blue, with ripples and splashes indicating movement. The scene tracks a diver standing poised on the platform to their contact with the water, where a splash marks the entry. The overall atmosphere is focused on the diving activity, with the pool's surface and the structured seating area providing context.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of the young man standing on the diving platform, centered in the frame. He is positioned in the foreground, with the diving board and metal railings to his left and the tiered seating area in the background. The camera is at the subject's level, capturing him from the side as he prepares to dive. As he leaps off the platform, the camera angle shifts to above him, following his descent. The subject moves from the top center of the frame towards the bottom, executing a series of flips. The spectators in the background remain seated, observing the dive. The camera continues to track the subject's movement, showing him entering the water near the bottom center of the frame. The splash created upon impact is captured in the foreground, with the pool's surface and ripples filling the rest of the frame. Throughout the sequence, the camera maintains a clear view of the subject's actions, transitioning smoothly from a side view to an overhead perspective.",
