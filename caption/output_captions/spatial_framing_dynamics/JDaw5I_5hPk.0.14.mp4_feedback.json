    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a misty coastal landscape. The foreground is composed of calm, blue water occupying the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, gentle waves roll onto a sandy beach that stretches across the scene. Two small, distant figures are visible in the middle ground on the left, standing near several dark sea stacks. The background is dominated by large, mist-shrouded cliffs and rock formations that occupy the right and central portions of the frame, creating a sense of depth. The camera is positioned at a low height relative to the scenery.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a landscape scenery shot of a vast and misty coastline. The scene is characterized by a muted, blue-gray color palette and a thick haze that softens the details, creating an ethereal atmosphere. Gentle waves with white crests wash over a wide, sandy beach, while in the distance, the dark, jagged silhouettes of large sea stacks and cliffs rise from the water and shore. The focus is on the immense scale and serene mood of the environment, with a couple of tiny, distant figures on the beach serving only to accentuate the vastness of the natural setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A hazy, coastal landscape features a wide, sandy beach where dynamic, large waves roll from the right side of the frame to the left, creating white foam as they reach the shore. The ocean extends from the foreground to the background, with dynamic, blue water. In the distance, several large, dark rock formations and cliffs rise from the sea and the coastline, their silhouettes softened and layered by a thick mist. A few small, distant figures can be seen walking on the sand near the water's edge. The entire scene is enveloped in a soft, diffuse light, creating a muted color palette dominated by shades of blue and gray.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
