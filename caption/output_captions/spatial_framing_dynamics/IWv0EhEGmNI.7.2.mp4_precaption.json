    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective in a video game, a person in dark clothing lies motionless on the ground in a dark, foggy street at night. To the right, a white sedan is parked near a low wall. The scene is illuminated by a single, tall, glowing streetlight. The view is framed by the dark silhouettes of two-story buildings. Several on-screen user interface elements are visible: a compass at the top of the screen indicates a heading of 111 degrees southeast; an objective in white text reads \"Find Hadir.\" and later updates to \"Search the clocktower for Hadir.\"; a white waypoint marker on the right is labeled \"Search Church\" with a distance of 93 meters; and subtitles at the bottom of the screen display dialogue in red and green text. A white crosshair appears in the center of the view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, looks out onto a dark, foggy street at night. The scene is dimly illuminated by a single, tall streetlamp whose light is diffused by the thick fog. On the left stands a dark, two-story building with an arched doorway that reveals a lit room inside. The view is partially obscured by a dark structure on the right, and as the perspective shifts slightly, a white car and a body on the paved ground become visible further down the street. The scene includes several overlay elements: a compass at the top of the screen, objective text that changes from \"Find Hadir.\" to \"Search the clocktower for Hadir.\", location markers with distance indicators, and dialogue subtitles at the bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person, eye-level perspective, the scene is framed by the dark silhouettes of buildings in the left and right foreground. In the middle ground, a tall, glowing streetlight stands center-right, illuminating a foggy street. A building with a lit, arched doorway is visible in the left middle ground. As the perspective moves slightly forward and to the right, a person lying motionless on the ground in the center middle ground and a white sedan parked in the right middle ground become more visible. Throughout the shot, user interface elements are present: a compass and objective text are at the top center, waypoints are on the left and right sides of the screen, and subtitles are at the bottom. During the movement, the objective text updates, and a white crosshair appears in the center of the frame.",
