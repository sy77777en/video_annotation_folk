    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static extreme wide shot of a dramatic landscape, focusing on a weather event rather than a specific subject. A massive, dark storm cloud occupies the top, center, and right portions of the frame, situated in the middle ground and background. A rain shaft extends from the cloud to the ground on the right side of the frame in the background. In contrast, a break in the clouds revealing blue sky is located in the top left of the frame. A flat, dark plain stretches across the bottom of the frame in the foreground and middle ground. On the horizon, a small tree is silhouetted in the bottom center-left, with a slender tower to its right in the bottom center, both in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of a powerful weather event rather than a specific main subject. A colossal, dark grey supercell storm cloud dominates the sky, its turbulent, rotating base lowering towards a flat, dark plain. To the right, a heavy rain shaft visibly connects the cloud to the ground, while a stark contrast is created on the left by a break in the clouds, revealing a patch of bright blue sky and brilliantly lit white cloud formations. The overwhelming size of the storm is further emphasized by the tiny silhouettes of a lone tree and a distant, slender tower on the horizon, which serve to highlight the sheer power of the natural spectacle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene captures a vast, flat landscape beneath a dramatic and turbulent sky. A massive, dark gray storm cloud dominates the view, featuring a low-hanging, well-defined base from which curtains of rain fall in the distance. To the left, a break in the storm reveals a patch of blue sky and bright white clouds. The horizon is a dark, straight line, punctuated by the silhouettes of a single tree and a tall, thin tower against the pale light at the edge of the plain.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
