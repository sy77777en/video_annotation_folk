    "pre_caption": "A man is shown in a medium shot, positioned in the center-left of the frame and in the middle ground. To his left, a wooden lectern is visible, also in the middle ground. To his right, a large white projection screen occupies the right side of the frame, extending from the top to the bottom edge. In the background, behind the man and the lectern, is a deep red wall. The man gestures with his hands while speaking, but his position within the static frame does not change. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged white man with short, brown, receding hair and a trimmed brown and gray beard is shown from the waist up. He is wearing a very light blue, almost white, long-sleeved, button-down shirt and dark trousers. Around his neck, he wears a red lanyard with a clear ID badge. A watch is visible on his left wrist, and a thin black wire for a microphone is clipped to his shirt collar. He stands while speaking and gesturing with his hands, holding a small black object, likely a presentation remote.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This is an indoor shot of a presentation room. A man wearing a light-colored shirt and a red lanyard stands center-left, in front of a deep red wall. To his left is a light-colored wooden lectern, and to his right is a large, white projection screen that takes up a significant portion of the view. The lighting is even and consistent with an indoor environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
