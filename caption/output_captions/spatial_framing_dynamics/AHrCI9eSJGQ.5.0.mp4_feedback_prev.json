    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide, high-angle scenery shot from a static, forward-facing perspective on a container ship. Stacks of shipping containers are positioned in the foreground and middle ground, occupying the bottom half of the frame. The ocean is visible in the middle ground on the left and right sides, stretching into the background to meet the horizon. The sky fills the top half of the frame in the background, featuring rapidly moving time-lapsed clouds and a bright sun in the top right. A text overlay is located in the bottom right foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dramatic maritime scenery shot from the high vantage point of a massive container ship navigating the open ocean. The perspective looks forward over stacks of red, blue, and gray-colored shipping containers, which lead the eye toward the vast sea stretching to the horizon. A wide, expansive sky dominates the view, filled with a dynamic, time-lapsed layer of swirling grey and white clouds, with the bright, hazy sun partially obscured. There is no single main subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high vantage, forward-facing perspective on a massive container ship, the vessel sails across a vast, dark ocean. Stacks of multicolored shipping containers\u2014primarily grey, blue, and orange\u2014are visible on the deck below and ahead, with the sea stretching toward the horizon. The sky is filled with rapidly moving grey and white clouds in a time-lapse, with a bright, hazy sun partially covered. An overlay in the lower right displays the text \"YouTube JEFFHK\" in white and red.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
