    "pre_caption": "In a static, low-angle close-up shot, a muscular man is positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. His red boxing glove is in the left foreground, with its white string extending across the frame to his other hand, which is located in the center middle ground. The background consists of a paneled ceiling.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A muscular man with long, wavy, dark red hair and a stylized, angular face is shown from the chest up. He has a confident smirk, and his eyes are completely white with no visible pupils. He wears a black, short-sleeved shirt. On his right hand, he wears a large, red boxing glove.  The left hand is holding the white string used to tighten the glove around the wrist.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting with a paneled ceiling featuring two long, white light strips on either side, a muscular figure with long, reddish-brown hair is shown in a close-up view. The figure wears a reddish-brown boxing glove on one hand and uses the other to pull a white lace tight. The character is dressed in a black shirt, and the scene is evenly lit.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.",
