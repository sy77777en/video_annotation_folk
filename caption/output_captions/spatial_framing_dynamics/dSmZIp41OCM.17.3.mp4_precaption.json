    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A cartoon-style humanoid figure with an atypical appearance stands on a wooden dock in a 2.5D game scene. The figure is clad in a long, blue, hooded cloak that covers its body, revealing only thin, stick-like legs. Its head is a perfectly round, orange sphere with a simple, carved smiling face, resembling a jack-o'-lantern. Next to the figure, a stylized, dark-colored fishing rod with an ornate, gear-like base is propped up on a stand. A small, wooden boat with a cabin is moored at the dock; it features a cel-shaded art style and has a symbol on its door that may not be a peace sign.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 2.5D game video with a cel-shaded art style, a scene unfolds on a reddish-brown wooden dock extending over teal-colored water animated with swirling white patterns. A small wooden boat is tied to the dock. On the grassy shore behind the dock, there are a few trees, a white picket fence, and a stone well surrounded by a circular brick path. A fishing rod is set up on a stand at the end of the dock. The scene includes a game HUD with several overlays: in the bottom-left corner, a coin icon shows the number 22; a central inventory bar displays icons for two bags, a leaf, a stick, and a pink item; and in the bottom-right corner, two vertical status bars, one blue and one translucent, are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a high angle, initially frames a stick-legged, cloaked character in the center-left middle ground, standing on a wooden dock. To the character's left, a fishing rod is propped up in the foreground. The dock extends from the top right towards the bottom left, with a boat moored to it in the top-right middle ground. The surrounding water fills the foreground, while a grassy shore with a well and trees occupies the background at the top of the frame. A game HUD with a coin count in the bottom-left, an inventory bar at the bottom center, and status bars in the bottom-right is overlaid in the foreground. The character then walks up the dock, moving from the center-left towards the top center of the frame, while the camera remains stationary.",
