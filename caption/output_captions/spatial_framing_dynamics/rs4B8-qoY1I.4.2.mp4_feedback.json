    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a wide shot with a tilted overhead angle. In the middle ground, a green humanoid figure is initially positioned left of center, near a central pillar with a chest in front of it. An archway is located in the far left middle ground, and a table stands in the right middle ground. Green rectangular shapes forming walls are visible in the background, primarily at the top of the frame. The humanoid figure moves from its starting position towards the right, passing the central pillar, and comes to a stop next to the table in the right middle ground. Simultaneously, in the foreground at the bottom right, a yellow sun icon within a red scroll-like frame moves horizontally from the left to the right side of its container. Additional interface elements are present in the foreground: at the bottom left, a green scroll displays an icon and the number \"04,\" while at the bottom center, the word \"Day\" appears above \"00.\"",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a pixelated, retro-style scene with a green and black color scheme. A small, humanoid figure with a blocky appearance and a green outfit is visible, moving around a room with brick walls. The figure bypasses a tall stack of blocks and then moves next to a small table, interacting with it. In the lower right corner, within a red, arc-shaped frame, a yellow, sun-like object gradually moves from left to right, becoming visible. The scene includes a scroll-like interface at the bottom, displaying numbers and symbols, adding to the vintage game aesthetic.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows a retro, pixelated scene rendered in green on a black background. The environment features blocky, green structures, including an archway on the left, a tall, tiered pillar in the center with a chest in front of it, and a table-like object on the right. Surrounding the top of the frame are green rectangular shapes that form walls. A small, green, pixelated character wearing a hat moves from near the central pillar towards the table. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays game interface elements: on the left, a green scroll border encloses a person icon and the number \"04\"; in the center, the word \"Day\" appears in blue with white overlay text \"00\" below it, integrated into the scroll; and on the right, a red scroll border frames a yellow sun icon.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
