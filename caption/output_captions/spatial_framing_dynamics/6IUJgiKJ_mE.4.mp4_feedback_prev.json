    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of two cyclists on a long, open road. The cyclist on the left, wearing a yellow and black jersey, is positioned in the bottom left of the frame, while the cyclist on the right, in a white and black jersey, is in the bottom center. Both cyclists are in the foreground, moving away from the viewer. The road stretches into the background, with vehicles and people visible along the roadside, indicating a race or event. The camera is positioned above the cyclists, capturing the expansive rural landscape with grassy fields on either side. The road's straight path and the cyclists' movement create a sense of progression and depth within the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two cyclists riding on a long, open road. The cyclist on the left wears a yellow and black jersey with the number 34, black shorts, and a helmet, riding a bicycle with a teal frame. The cyclist on the right wears a white and black jersey, black shorts, and a helmet, riding a bicycle with a dark frame. Both cyclists are positioned in the center of the road, moving away from the viewer. In the distance, several vehicles and people are visible along the roadside, indicating a race or organized event. The road is straight and stretches into the horizon, flanked by grassy fields.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene on a long, straight road stretching into the distance under a clear blue sky, indicating daytime. The setting is a rural area with open fields on either side, bordered by low vegetation and distant tree lines. The road is paved with a smooth surface, marked by yellow and white lines. Two cyclists are prominently featured, riding along the road, with their colorful jerseys and bicycles adding dynamic elements to the scene. Vehicles and a few people are visible in the background, suggesting a cycling event or race. The overall atmosphere is calm and expansive, with the road and landscape creating a sense of movement and progression.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
