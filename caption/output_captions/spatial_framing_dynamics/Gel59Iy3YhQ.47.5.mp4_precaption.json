    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays two central figures with atypical appearances. A small, insect-like character with a white, horned head or mask, a black body, and a red cloak is perched atop a significantly larger creature, holding a thin, nail-like weapon. This mount is a large, pale, segmented arthropod-like being with a rounded front section featuring two simple black eyes. Numerous smaller, indistinct dark figures, some resembling bells or shells, crowd the space below and above these central subjects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile, shows a dimly lit, cavernous setting. The upper portion of the scene is densely packed with dark, rounded, bell-like or pod-like objects, some with a subtle metallic sheen, creating a cluttered ceiling. In the center, a large, pale, segmented creature with a smooth, white head and two black eye spots moves through a bed of smaller, dark, indistinct forms. A small, white-headed figure with a red cloak and a slender, pointed implement is perched atop this larger creature. The overall lighting is subdued, with a soft, diffuse glow illuminating the central figures and parts of the background, while the peripheries fade into deep shadow. The color palette is predominantly dark, with browns, blacks, and the pale tones of the creatures, accented by the red of the small figure's cloak.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a full shot of the subjects. In the center middle ground, a small, red-cloaked figure is perched atop a larger, pale, segmented creature. These central figures are positioned above a dense mass of smaller, dark, indistinct forms that occupy the bottom foreground and middle ground of the frame. The top portion of the scene, in the background and middle ground, is densely filled with dark, rounded, bell-like objects, creating a cluttered ceiling. The camera is positioned to the side, capturing the scene in profile, level with the main subjects.",
