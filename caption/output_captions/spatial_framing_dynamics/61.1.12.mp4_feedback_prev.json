    "pre_caption": "From a first-person point-of-view, the shot is framed from a seated perspective looking slightly down. In the immediate foreground, two hands extend upward from the bottom of the frame, with the right hand on the bottom right and the left hand on the bottom left; both hands are actively gesturing with splayed fingers. A table occupies the middle ground in the lower half of the frame, holding a coffee mug in the bottom center, another mug further back and to the left, and a plate to the right of center. Across the table, a person is positioned in the center of the frame, slumped forward with their head down. In the background, another patron is seated in a red booth directly behind the central figure, while other patrons and booths are visible in the deeper background on both the left and right sides.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a pair of dark-skinned, wrinkled hands are held up with fingers splayed. The right hand is adorned with a large, light-colored ring on the ring finger and a bracelet composed of turquoise and brown beads. Seated across the table is a man with short, dark hair, wearing a light-colored t-shirt. He is slumped forward with his head resting on the table, but his left hand is raised. On the table between them are two white coffee mugs; the one closer to the camera is full, while the one further away is two-thirds full. A white plate holds a partially eaten pastry and a spoon. In a booth further back, another man is seen from behind, wearing a shirt with colorful vertical stripes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, takes place inside a dimly lit diner at night. The perspective is from a table looking out over red booths. On the table are white ceramic mugs containing coffee, a plate with a partially eaten pastry, and a spoon. In the immediate foreground, two hands gesture upwards; the right hand wears a large, light-colored ring and a bracelet made of brown and turquoise beads. A person sits opposite, slumped forward with their head on the table, while other patrons occupy booths in the background under warm lighting and shiny tinsel decorations.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is filmed in a restaurant, showing a pair of wrinkled hands with rings and bracelets in first-person POV. Across the table, a man rests his head on his arms while extending his index finger. There are drinks and leftover food on the dining table.",
