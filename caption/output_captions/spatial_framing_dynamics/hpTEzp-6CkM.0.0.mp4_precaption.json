    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the video, a man with light skin and short brown hair, wearing a black t-shirt and a forward-facing grey baseball cap, holds the camera selfie-style. He is initially smiling with one arm raised and later speaks to the camera. In front of him stands a man with black hair, wearing a blue t-shirt with patterns on the chest. Behind this man is a woman with dark hair tied back, wearing a pink patterned top. Further back along the walkway, two other men appear; one wears a white t-shirt and dark pants, while the man behind him wears a white long-sleeved top and dark pants, making a peace sign with his hand. Both these men have light skin and short blond hair.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot shows a person holding the camera on an outdoor metal walkway high above a sprawling cityscape. The video takes place during the daytime under a clear blue sky. Below, a dense urban environment stretches to the horizon, filled with numerous buildings of various sizes. Adjacent to the walkway, a tall, white, metal lattice structure, part of a building located behind the one they are on, rises into the sky. The walkway itself is constructed from dark metal beams and grating. Other people are visible on the walkway in the middle ground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium close-up shot centers on a man in a black t-shirt in the foreground, positioned slightly to the right of the frame. He holds the camera at his level. Initially, a woman in a pink top is visible in the middle ground, to the left of the center, standing on a metal walkway that extends from the bottom left into the background. As the video plays, other people walk forward along the walkway from the background. A man in a blue t-shirt moves into the middle ground to the left of the main subject, while two other men in white shirts appear further back in the center-right of the frame. The background consists of a sprawling cityscape filling the left side and a tall lattice tower on the right.",
