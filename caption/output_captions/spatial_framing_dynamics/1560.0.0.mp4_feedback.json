    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, positioning a large, domed neoclassical building in the center of the frame and the middle ground. Other buildings are visible in the middle ground on the left and right sides, while a sky with clouds occupies the background at the top. The camera, positioned at a low angle, rapidly dollies forward and tilts upward. This movement causes the shot to transition into a medium shot, with the central building moving from the middle ground to fill the foreground. The upward tilt shifts the focus from the entire structure to its upper half, centering on the triangular pediment and the base of the dome, while the golden statue at the very top remains in the upper center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The central subject is a large, neoclassical building constructed from light-colored stone. It features a prominent portico with tall, fluted Corinthian columns supporting a triangular pediment, which is adorned with a relief sculpture depicting several human figures in classical attire. Multiple stone statues of human figures are positioned along the roofline and at the base of a large, greenish-copper dome that crowns the building. A golden statue of a winged figure stands atop the lantern at the very peak of the dome.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone moves rapidly toward the French Cathedral in Berlin's Gendarmenmarkt square. The neoclassical building is constructed from light-colored stone and features a large, green-patinated dome topped with a golden statue. The scene is set during the day under a blue sky with fast-moving white clouds. The periphery of the view is blurred with a radial motion effect, creating a sense of speed, while the central cathedral remains in focus. Other buildings are visible on the sides of the square.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video opens with an extreme wide shot of a neoclassical domed building surrounded by ornate columns. The camera swiftly dollies forward and tilts upward, focusing on a statue of a man atop the triangular pediment.",
