    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features an architectural scenery shot of a long, empty hallway, creating a sterile and unsettling atmosphere. The entire scene is bathed in a cold, monochromatic blue-green light, with the primary illumination coming from a large, brightly lit, multi-paned window at the far end of the corridor. This light reflects faintly on the polished tile floor, emphasizing the length and emptiness of the space. The symmetrical composition, with recessed doorways or alcoves on either side, contributes to the institutional and slightly ominous feel. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the environment and the powerful, clinical mood it evokes, using the vacant space to suggest isolation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place in a quiet, indoor hallway with smooth tiled floors and walls lined with rectangular panels and large windows. The setting is illuminated by soft, cool-toned light streaming through a set of frosted glass windows at the far end, casting a blue hue across the space and creating subtle reflections on the floor. The hallway is symmetrical, with closed doors on either side and a ceiling featuring recessed sections. The environment appears clean and orderly, with no visible clutter or decorations. In the lower left corner, there is a small white overlay that sequentially displays the digits of the number \"2006\" as the video progresses.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to frame a long, empty hallway, with the camera positioned at approximately eye level, aligned with the center of the corridor. The hallway extends from the foreground, where the floor tiles and lower portions of the walls are visible, to the background, where a large, multi-paned window occupies the center of the frame and serves as the primary light source. The symmetrical composition places recessed doorways or alcoves along both the left and right sides in the middle ground, while the window and the end wall dominate the background and center. The camera remains stationary, maintaining a consistent perspective and height throughout the video. In the lower left corner of the frame, a small white overlay sequentially displays the digits of \"2006,\" remaining in the foreground. There are no major subjects present, and the focus is on the spatial depth and symmetry of the architectural environment.",
