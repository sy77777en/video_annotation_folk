    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with long, dark brown hair tied back in a ponytail is seen from the back and in profile. She is wearing a dark gray, short-sleeved t-shirt. She stands in a dimly lit hallway, looking towards a closed door on her right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A woman with her hair in a ponytail stands in a dimly lit indoor hallway. The light-colored walls are cast in deep shadow, creating a dark atmosphere. To the right is a closed white door with a silver handle. Further down the wall, a single, dark-framed picture hangs on the wall. Another white door is visible in the background at the end of the corridor. The scene is illuminated by a soft, ambient light source from off-camera, which highlights the woman's profile and the edges of the objects in the hall.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a woman from the back, positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground of a dimly lit hallway. To her right, in the middle ground, is a closed door, with a framed picture hanging on the wall between her and the door. In the background on the left, another door is visible at the end of the corridor. The woman turns to her right, shifting into a profile view as she looks toward the door on the right. The camera remains static and is positioned at the woman's level.",
