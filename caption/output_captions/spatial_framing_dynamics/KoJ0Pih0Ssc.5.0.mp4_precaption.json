    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a series of rusted metal barricades, known as Czech hedgehogs, aligned parallel to a wire fence on their right across a sandy area. These structures are dark brown and have a cross-like shape, with visible bolts and a weathered texture. In the background, there is a tall, cylindrical concrete watchtower with a small, enclosed top section, positioned closer to a tall, smooth concrete wall that runs parallel to the sandy area. Surrounding the area are several multi-story buildings with a modern, utilitarian design, characterized by flat roofs and numerous windows. A single streetlamp stands between the watchtower and the Czech hedgehogs, adding to the urban setting. The scene is well-lit, suggesting daylight, and the overall atmosphere is stark and industrial.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a bright, sunlit outdoor setting, a long, curving row of rusty, brown metal tank traps sits on a wide strip of sandy ground. To the left, a tall, cylindrical concrete watchtower stands next to a high concrete wall. In the background, beyond the wall, are several gray, multi-story apartment buildings. A white chain-link fence runs parallel to the tank traps on the right. A blue rectangular overlay with the white text \"TANK TRAPS\" appears in the lower portion of the scene, positioned over the anti-tank obstacles.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a high angle, capturing a long, curving line of tank traps that starts in the bottom right foreground and extends into the center middle ground. In the background, a concrete watchtower is positioned on the top left, adjacent to a high concrete wall, with several buildings visible behind it. A wire fence runs along the right side of the frame from the middle ground to the background. The camera then pans slightly to the right and tilts down, shifting to a full shot at the level of the tank traps. In this final composition, the tank traps dominate the frame, leading from the bottom right foreground into the middle ground, while a text overlay appears in the bottom center over the obstacles.",
