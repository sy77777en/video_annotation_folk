    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays two white commercial jet airplanes at an airport. Both airplanes are depicted in the middleground. One airplane, larger and more prominent, is shown ascending from a runway, its nose pointed upwards as it gains altitude. Further in the distance, on a parallel runway or taxiway, a second, smaller white commercial jet airplane is visible on the ground. Both aircraft are of a similar design, featuring swept-back wings and a distinct tail fin. The setting includes clearly demarcated runways and taxiways.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an objective POV shot of an airport under a hazy, reddish-sepia sky. Two white airplanes are visible; one is in the process of taking off, ascending into the air, while a smaller one remains on the ground on a runway or taxiway. The airport features dark gray asphalt runways and taxiways marked with white and yellow lines, interspersed with patches of green grass. In the distant background, indistinct, blocky silhouettes of buildings are visible through the haze. As the camera moves to the right, following the movement of the ascending aircraft, some buildings become visible in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The wide shot, captured at the subjects' level, initially frames a larger airplane in the left-middle ground on a runway and a smaller airplane in the right-middle ground on a parallel taxiway. Dark asphalt occupies the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame, with runways, taxiways, and green grass situated in the middle ground, and hazy, blocky buildings visible in the distant background under a reddish sky. As the larger airplane takes off, ascending diagonally upwards and towards the right, the camera tracks horizontally to the right to follow its movement. This camera movement causes the ascending airplane to shift from its initial left-middle ground position towards the center of the frame as it gains altitude, while the smaller, grounded airplane moves from the right-middle ground towards the far-right edge of the frame. Concurrently, the foreground dark asphalt reveals increasingly complex yellow taxiway markings, including lines and circular patterns, which enter from the right and move across the lower portion of the frame, occupying the foreground and lower-middle ground. The middle ground runways, grass, and the distant background buildings also shift leftwards relative to the frame due to the camera's rightward motion.",
