    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with some facial hair is shown from the neck up, looking directly upward. He wears a red headband and is holding a long, green celery stalk vertically upward with his mouth. The celery stalk is then sliced in half by a playing card that is thrown through the air. Partially visible behind this man is another person's hand, which throws the card, and a portion of their head with short brown hair.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Set outdoors against a dark, blurred background of green foliage, a long, green celery stalk is balanced vertically on a person's face. The person is wearing a red baseball cap worn backward and looking upward. In slow motion, a playing card is thrown from off-screen, slicing through the celery stalk. The top half of the stalk and the card are seen falling away, while the bottom portion remains momentarily in place.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person holding a piece of celery in his mouth, with only his head visible at the bottom of the frame. The celery takes up 70% of the frame\u2019s height. Behind him, another person appears partially, with just part of their head and hand visible. The person behind throws a playing card, which cuts through the celery.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot frames a man's head in the bottom center foreground, with a long celery stalk extending vertically from his mouth up through the center of the frame. In the middle ground, another person's hand is positioned to the left of the celery, and a portion of their head is visible to the right. The background is composed of dark, blurred foliage. A playing card enters from the left, travels horizontally across the middle of the frame, and slices the celery stalk in the center. The top portion of the celery is then propelled upward, while the card falls away to the left. The man and the bottom half of the celery remain stationary in their initial position at the bottom center of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and remains static throughout the clip.",
