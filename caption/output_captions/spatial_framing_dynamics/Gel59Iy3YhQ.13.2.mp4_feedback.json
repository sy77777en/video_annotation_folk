Text and a logo for \"PATHOS-II\" are positioned in the top-left corner of the screen, with a large, skull-like object on a platform just below. The main facility occupies the center and right portions of the screen, while a small map is located in the bottom-left corner.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a close-up of a green-gray, retro-style computer monitor. The screen first shows a glitchy, digital schematic of a sprawling underwater facility labeled \"PATHOS-II,\" located at a depth between 90 and 4000 meters. The facility consists of various buildings and towers on a rocky outcrop, with some structures emitting a red glow. To the left, a large, ram-like skull is mounted on a floating platform. A small map inset is visible in the lower-left corner. The display then flickers to a distorted corporate image under a yellow, pixelated \"WAU\" logo. This image shows a group of people whose faces are heavily obscured by digital artifacts, with the slogan \"DEVELOPING THE FUTURE AS A TEAM!\" written below them. Both images are overlaid with horizontal scan lines, giving them a corrupted, low-fidelity appearance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A monitor is set within a weathered, greenish-gray industrial frame in a dark environment. The screen displays a corrupted video feed characterized by horizontal scan lines and digital glitches. The feed flickers between two scenes: one is a depiction of an underwater facility labeled \"PATHOS-II,\" situated at a depth between 90 and 4000 meters, with a small map of the Atlantic Ocean visible in the corner. The other scene is a heavily distorted corporate photograph of a team, captioned \"DEVELOPING THE FUTURE AS A TEAM!\" with a \"WAU\" logo in the upper left. The underwater view is rendered in murky teal tones with red and white light sources, while the corporate image is pixelated, obscuring the faces of the individuals.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
