    "pre_caption": "A full shot frames the animated cat, Tom, in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, sitting on a concrete step while holding a black keyboard. To his right in the middle ground, there is a large cardboard box, with wooden pallets further to the right and black trash bags in the background behind the box. A brick wall and a staircase occupy the background on the left, while the wet, paved ground is visible in the foreground. The right side of the keyboard then breaks off, falling from its position in the middle ground down to the foreground on the right, revealing a cluster of wires. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A 2D animated cat, identifiable as Tom, sits on a step. He has blue-grey fur, a light grey-blue chest, and white muzzle and paws, with pink inner ears. He holds a black electronic keyboard, which is broken, with a cluster of colorful wires exposed after the right part fell to the ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The setting is a dark, wet alley at night, with a brick wall and a metal door and concrete staircase in the background. The ground is composed of dark paving stones, reflecting some light because of the wet surface. On a concrete step sits a large, open cardboard box, with stacked wooden pallets right to it and black trash bags behind it. A cartoon cat sits on the step holding a black electronic keyboard, which subsequently breaks apart to drop its right side to the ground and expose its internal wiring.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
