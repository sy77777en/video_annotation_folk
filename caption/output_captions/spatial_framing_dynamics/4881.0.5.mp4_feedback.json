    "pre_caption": "This is a medium close-up shot of a man positioned in the center foreground. His head is slightly tilted to his right. In the background, a gold-colored shelf-like structure is visible in the middle-left, holding two white cylindrical objects and a patterned object. To the left, a patterned object, possibly a leg, is in the foreground to middle ground. On the right side of the frame, smoke is visible in the foreground to middle ground, and an orange object is in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with curly brown hair, a mustache, and light skin is shown from the chest up, looking directly at the camera with his head slightly tilted to the right. He is wearing a light blue, fuzzy, open-front cardigan over a white undershirt and a gold chain necklace. Some smoke is visible on the right side of the frame, suggesting that the man might still be smoking.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, in a dimly lit room with a dark background. In the middle-left section of the background, a blurred, gold-colored shelf-like structure holds two white cylindrical objects and an object resembling a patterned flower pot. On the left side of the frame, a patterned object, which appears to be the leg of a seated person wearing patterned pants, is partially visible. On the right side of the frame's background, there is an orange object.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
