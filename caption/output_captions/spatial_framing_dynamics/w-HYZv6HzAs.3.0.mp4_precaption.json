    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a Black man with a bald head and a light goatee, who is standing on a stage and speaking. He is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved button-down shirt and dark trousers. He gestures with his hands as he addresses an audience. The audience is seated in the foreground, facing the stage, and is mostly visible as dark silhouettes, showing the backs of their heads and shoulders. The man is positioned in front of a large sign that reads \"TEDxRyersonU\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is an indoor auditorium during a presentation. A man in a light-colored shirt and dark pants stands on a wooden stage, speaking to an audience. Behind him, a large sign reads \"TEDxRyersonU\" in bold red and white letters. Further in the background, stylized cutouts of a city skyline are illuminated with blue light against a black backdrop. The stage is lit, while the audience in the foreground is seated in darkness, their figures appearing as silhouettes. The man gestures with his hands as he addresses the crowd.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A wide shot shows a man standing in the middle ground on the right side of a stage. In the foreground, the silhouettes of an audience are visible at the bottom of the frame. Behind the man, in the middle ground, a large \"TEDxRyersonU\" sign spans the width of the stage. Further back, a stylized city skyline cutout is visible in the background. The man walks from the right towards the center of the stage, gestures with his hands, and then walks back towards the right before returning to the center. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the subject's level.",
