    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A stylized, red-colored hand holds a short, cylindrical glass that rests on a skin-colored paper napkin. The glass contains a multi-colored liquid with a bright cyan top layer featuring swirling, magenta amoeba-like shapes, and a lower portion with a light green and pink camouflage pattern. To the right of the glass, a single green olive on a red toothpick lies in a small brown puddle on the orange surface. A small, cartoonish pink elephant wearing a yellow party hat emerges from behind the glass and walks to the right, ultimately positioning itself in the upper middle-right part of the frame as the video concludes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a scene with a flat, animated style, a red hand holds a short glass on a vibrant orange surface. The glass contains a multi-colored liquid with a bright cyan top layer, featuring swirling, magenta amoeba-like shapes, and a lower portion with a light green and pink camouflage pattern. The glass sits on a skin-colored napkin marked with a gray spill. In the front right, a green olive on a red toothpick rests in a puddle of brown liquid. A small, cartoonish pink elephant wearing a yellow party hat appears from behind the cup and walks to the right, ending up in the upper middle-right part of the frame as the video concludes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle perspective, the scene is framed on an orange surface. A red hand occupies the foreground on the left, holding a glass in the center that rests on a napkin. In the middle ground, an olive on a toothpick is positioned in the top-right. A small, pink elephant emerges from behind the glass in the center and walks to the right, coming to a stop in the middle ground at the upper-middle-right of the frame. A portion of a box is visible in the top-left corner. The camera remains static throughout the shot.",
