    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit setting, a Black man with dark, braided hair is shown. He wears a light-colored, horizontally striped t-shirt with the words \"AMERICA RECYCLES\" and a graphic printed on the chest. Over this, he has an unzipped dark jacket with a lighter, patterned lining visible on the left side. His accessories include a beaded choker-style necklace, another chain, earrings in both ears, rings on both hands\u2014with a ring on the right ring finger and rings on the left ring and pinky fingers\u2014and a gold-colored bracelet on his left wrist. He has a grill on his teeth. He brings a lit cigarette or cigarillo to his mouth to smoke, then leans back with his upper body tilted, arms spread out, exhaling a plume of smoke with his mouth open.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark outdoor setting at night, a person is illuminated by a single, warm light source that casts a yellow-orange glow. The ground appears to be dirt, and the surrounding area is obscured by deep shadows, with the lower bodies of some people visible in the background. The individual, wearing a striped t-shirt with the words \"AMERICA RECYCLES\" and an open, dark jacket with a patterned lining, brings a small, lit object to their mouth. They then lean back, looking upwards as they exhale a plume of white smoke into the dimly lit air.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, with the camera at his level. Other figures are partially visible in the dark background. The man then leans back, and the camera moves to a high-angle position, looking down at him. This transition reframes the scene into a medium close-up, with the man's head and torso now occupying the center of the frame as he lies on the ground.",
