    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, framing a camel in the left foreground and two people sitting in the middle ground to the right, beside a stone building. The camera, positioned at approximately eye level with standing subjects, then pans to the right, transitioning into a wide shot. This movement reveals a large group of people and several other camels gathered in the middle ground, shifting the initial building to the left side of the frame. A prominent camel now stands in the right middle ground. The entire scene is set against a background dominated by a large, rocky cliff face and distant mountain peaks that become more expansive as the camera pans.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of camels and people in a rocky, desert-like setting. The camels are adorned with colorful blankets and saddles, standing or resting on the ground. The people, dressed in a variety of clothing including long coats, jackets, and head coverings, are gathered around the camels. The scene suggests a gathering or preparation for a journey, with the rugged terrain and rocky backdrop providing context for the setting. The video starts by focusing on a single camel and then pans to the right, showing a group of people and a few more camels.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunny, mountainous desert landscape under a clear blue sky, a group of people and several camels are gathered on a rocky plateau. A rustic, single-story stone building is built into the base of a large, earthy brown cliff face. The structure has wooden doors, and a portion of its exterior wall is decorated with a black and white checkered pattern. The people are dressed in a variety of clothing, including jackets and traditional headscarves. The camels, some adorned with saddles, stand on the uneven ground. The scene pans from a closer view of a camel and two seated people to a wider shot that encompasses the entire group and the surrounding rugged mountain peaks.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

As the camera pans to the right, a single-story house appears, with two people seated in the middle ground in front of it. Then, another person appears in the right foreground, and the overall frame gradually expands to the right, encompassing the house and the figures, extending the sense of spatial narrative. As the camera continues to pan right, the house, originally in the relatively center of the frame, gradually shifts to the left. Then, a large group of people appears, stretching from the foreground to the middle ground, forming a dense crowd. In the right middle ground, a group of camels appears, with the rock face in the background. The distant peaks gradually become apparent, enriching the spatial depth of the scene and gradually unfolding the scene from near to far.",
