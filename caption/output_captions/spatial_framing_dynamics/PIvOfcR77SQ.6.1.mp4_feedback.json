    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a serene winter landscape, capturing an expansive view of the snowy terrain. Initially, the camera focuses on the left side of the scene, where a few bare trees stand in the middle ground, positioned towards the center-left of the frame. These trees are silhouetted against the cloudy sky in the background. A red building with a sloped roof occupies the right side of the frame, situated in the foreground. Its warm lights add a cozy touch to the scene. As the camera pans to the right, the red building moves out of the frame, revealing more structures with sloped roofs in the middle ground. These additional buildings, some red and some gray, are scattered across the snowy expanse, blending into the background. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned slightly above the snow level, providing a clear view of the entire landscape. The transition from the initial focus on the left to the broader view on the right is smooth, maintaining the wide shot throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a serene small town in a winter setting, featuring a few red houses covered in snow and a small Christmas tree adorned with lights, highlighting the cozy atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a serene outdoor winter setting during twilight, with a snow-covered landscape extending into the distance. The scene features a few bare trees scattered across the snowy terrain, their branches silhouetted against a cloudy sky. Initially, a red building with a sloped roof is visible on the right of the frame, adding a splash of color to the predominantly white environment. Warm light emanates from small light bulbs on its roof, creating a cozy contrast to the cold surroundings. As the camera pans to the right, more buildings with sloped roofs, some red and some gray, come into view, blending into the snowy backdrop. The atmosphere is calm, with no visible movement, emphasizing the stillness of the winter scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
