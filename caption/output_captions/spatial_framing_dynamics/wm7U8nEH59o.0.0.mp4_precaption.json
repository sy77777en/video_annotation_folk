    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two men seated side by side inside a vehicle, with the camera positioned to their left. The man further from the camera, on the left, is wearing a dark helmet with goggles and a dark jacket with light-colored accents. His face is partially illuminated, revealing a focused expression. The man closer to the camera, on the right, is also wearing a similar helmet and jacket, but his features are less visible due to being out of focus and the very dim lighting. Both men appear to be facing forward, suggesting they are either driving or riding in the vehicle, with the shadowy atmosphere adding to the scene's intensity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a vehicle in motion at night, with an indoor setting characterized by dim lighting. The interior is enveloped in dark, shadowy tones, with subtle highlights from ambient light sources outside casting a warm glow on the subjects in the front seats. Despite the darkness obscuring many features, the orange seatbelts stand out distinctly. The lighting creates a contrast between the illuminated faces and the darker surroundings, emphasizing the confined space. The overall atmosphere is subdued, with minimal external details visible through the windows, focusing on the interior environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of two men seated inside a vehicle. The camera is positioned to their left, capturing both men from the chest up. The man on the left, who is further from the camera, occupies the left-center of the frame in the foreground. He wears a dark helmet and jacket with light accents, and his face is partially illuminated. The second man, closer to the camera on the right, is slightly out of focus and positioned in the middle ground. He is similarly dressed but less visible due to the dim lighting. Both men face forward, indicating they are either driving or riding. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the sequence. The interior of the vehicle forms the immediate background, with faint external light sources creating subtle highlights. The overall framing emphasizes the confined space and the interaction between the two men.",
