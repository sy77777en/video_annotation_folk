    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man with glasses and a dark shirt is seen from the front, driving a yellow taxi at night with his hands on the steering wheel. In the back seat, a woman with dark hair and a dark top is partially visible, sitting behind the driver. Her reflection is also visible in the partition between the front and back seats.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to an object, keeps the perspective fixed on the front of a yellow taxi driving at night. The taxi's roof sign is illuminated, displaying the word 'TAXI' in uppercase white letters. Through the windshield, the dark interior of the car shows a driver behind the wheel and a passenger. In the background, a large, brightly lit building with a curved roof is visible across a highway with moving traffic. The entire scene is cast in a dim, yellowish light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot filmed from a locked-on perspective at the subjects' level, the front of a yellow taxi occupies the foreground. The driver is positioned in the middle ground, visible through the windshield in the center-right of the frame, while a passenger is seated in the middle ground to the center-left, partially obscured. In the background, a large, illuminated building is visible on the right side of the frame. As the taxi moves forward and slightly to the right, the background building shifts laterally toward the right edge of the frame, while the subjects inside the car maintain their positions relative to the camera.",
