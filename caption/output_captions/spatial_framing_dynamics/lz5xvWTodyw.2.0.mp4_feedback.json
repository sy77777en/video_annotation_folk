    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a hand-held paper cutout of a character in the foreground against a 2D animated background. The cutout is held in the center of the frame, obscuring the action behind it. The background is composed of a solid green vertical area on the left and a light blue field with various green shapes on the right. In the top right background, a red ball rests on a green, hilly shape. The entire background scene, including the red ball and green shapes, scrolls downwards, creating the effect of the camera following a character's descent along a path. The foreground cutout remains relatively centered, with slight hand-held movements, while the camera maintains a straight-on, eye-level perspective on the flat scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a hand-held paper cutout of a character positioned in front of a 2D animated scene. The character is a simple black line drawing on white paper, depicting a figure with a round face, two dot eyes, a wide grin, and spiky hair with a small leaf-like shape on top. This cutout is attached to a wooden stick. In the animated scene, which resembles a video game, a small red ball is visible on a green path. A paper-cut artwork moves downward along the same path, following the fast-moving trajectory of a small orange creature on the left side of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An animated scene with a simple, graphic style features a solid green area on the left and a light blue field on the right. The blue area is populated with various green shapes, including rounded hills, a flower outline, and other geometric forms. A small red circle is stationary at the top edge of a green shape. A hand-drawn paper cutout of a character with messy hair, held on a stick, moves side to side and downward across the scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a 2D game and an additional simple line-drawn character sticker. The camera follows the game character as it moves downward, but the line-drawn character sticker constantly covers the view of the game character.",
