    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a stylized figure of a man centrally located, wearing a blue shirt and a blue mask, without glasses. He is depicted adjusting a hard hat with both hands. Flanking this central figure are other stylized, dark, almost silhouetted figures of men, also wearing hard hats. One of these figures is positioned to the left of the scene's center, while another is located further back and to the center-right. The central figure and the silhouetted figure to the left of center-left are looking through a dark wooden-beamed frame at a dark and blurred environment. Meanwhile, the other blurred silhouetted figure is facing to the left side of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Viewed from within a dark, enclosed space, the scene looks out through a rectangular entrance framed by rough, dark wooden beams. Beyond the opening, a hazy, dust-filled environment is illuminated by a diffuse light. Several figures wearing hard hats occupy this space. A central figure, distinguished by a glowing blue color and dressed in a suit and tie, is seen adjusting their hat. This figure is flanked by other, darker, silhouetted figures, also in hard hats. Small, light-colored particles float throughout the air, contributing to the dusty atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium shot is framed from within a dark space, looking out through a wooden-beamed entrance that occupies the foreground. A glowing blue figure stands in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, adjusting a hard hat. To the left of this central figure, a dark, silhouetted figure is also positioned in the middle ground. Another silhouetted figure is located in the right middle ground, slightly behind the central one. The background is a hazy, dust-filled environment, and the camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
