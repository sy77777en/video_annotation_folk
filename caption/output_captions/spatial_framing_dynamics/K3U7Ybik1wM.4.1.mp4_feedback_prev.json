    "pre_caption": "This is a static, close-up scenery shot. Dark red curtains are positioned in the foreground, framing the scene on the left and right sides of the frame. In the center, a window acts as a middle-ground element, through which the background is viewed. A large, silhouetted tree is centrally located in the background, with a vibrant sunset sky visible behind it in the far background. Below the tree, at the bottom of the window view, a silhouetted fence is also visible in the background. The camera is positioned at eye level, looking straight out the window.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a window view scenery shot, capturing a dramatic sunset from the perspective of a dimly lit room. The scene is framed by heavy, dark red curtains, which draw the eye towards the central window. Through the glass, a vibrant sky glows with a gradient of fiery orange and yellow near the horizon, softening into shades of pink and purple higher up, with a few clouds visible against the lighter part of the sky. A large, leafy tree is starkly silhouetted against this colorful backdrop, its dark form creating a strong visual contrast. There is no single main subject, as the composition's focus is on the overall atmosphere and the breathtaking natural beauty of the sunset, framed by the domestic interior.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From inside a dimly lit room, a window is flanked by dark red curtains. Through the window's light-colored frame, a large tree is silhouetted against a vibrant sunset. The sky displays a gradient of orange, pink, and purple hues, with some clouds visible. At the bottom of the view, a silhouette of a fence can be seen below the tree.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the scenery.",
