    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot where a rough, gray-textured wall is prominent in the left foreground, and a white tiled walkway extends from the bottom center towards an arched doorway in the center background. To the right of the doorway, white tiled and rough gray-textured walls are in the background, with a dark tiled area in the bottom right middle ground and a circular ceiling light at the top center background. The camera then pans right and pulls back, transitioning to a wider shot. In this new framing, the rough gray-textured wall is on the left middle ground, the white tiled floor covers the bottom foreground and middle ground, and the arched doorway remains in the center background. A large rectangular area of black tiles with a central white platform occupies the center middle ground, with another rough gray-textured wall on the right middle ground. The circular ceiling light and smaller spotlights are visible at the top background. The camera maintains an eye-level perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an interior architectural scenery shot, focusing on the environment and atmosphere of a stark, modern space.The camera reveals a room where white ceramic tiles line the floor and the lower portion of the walls, creating a contrast with the rough gray-textured surface above. There is a rectangular area on the floor outlined with dark tiles, where reflections are clearly visible. An arched doorway with a dark interior stands at the far end. The scene is illuminated by a large circular ceiling light and smaller spotlights, creating a sterile ambiance. There is no main subject, as the intention is to showcase the architectural design, the interplay of light and shadow, and the overall mood of the space, emphasizing its scale and minimalist aesthetic rather than a particular focal point.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, pans right to reveal a large, brightly lit indoor room. The lower walls are a rough, textured grey-brown material, while the upper walls and floor are covered in small white square tiles. The center of the room features a large rectangular area lined with black square tiles, with a white tiled platform in its middle. A dark, arched doorway is situated at the far end. The space is illuminated by a prominent circular ceiling light and four smaller recessed lights.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
