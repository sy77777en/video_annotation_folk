    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three men seated inside a car. The man on the left has a medium skin tone, is wearing a dark hat, and a dark jacket. The man in the middle, with a lighter skin tone, is wearing a light-colored hat and a beige jacket over a green shirt. The man on the right, with a deep brown complexion, is wearing a dark hat and a dark jacket. All three men are facing forward, with the man on the right positioned as the driver. The scene conveys a sense of focus and engagement among the men.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting within a car, viewed from an objective perspective. The scene takes place during the day, as indicated by the natural light filtering through the windows. The car's interior features a rearview mirror and windshield wiper, with three individuals seated inside. The upholstery appears to be dark, complementing the overall muted color scheme. Outside the car, blurred elements suggest a tree-lined street. Overlay text is present, displaying a quote: \"We were just doing it to show off.\" - Spike Lee, prominently placed across the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of three men seated inside a car. The camera captures them from the front, at their eye level. The man on the left occupies the bottom left portion of the frame, positioned in the foreground. The man in the middle is centered, also in the foreground, while the man on the right sits slightly to the right, occupying the bottom right area of the frame. All three are in the foreground, with the car's interior forming the middle ground. The background outside the car is blurred, suggesting a tree-lined street. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position throughout the sequence. The camera remains static, maintaining a consistent view of the subjects.",
