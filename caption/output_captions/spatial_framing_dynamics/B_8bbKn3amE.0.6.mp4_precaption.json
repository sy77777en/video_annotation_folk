    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a dark blue top with a red hood and dark shorts walks along the narrow crest of a steep, reddish-brown mountain ridge. The individual is seen from a distance, moving steadily along the sharp, rocky edge.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a sweeping view of a vast, mountainous landscape under a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds. The camera moves along a narrow, sharp ridge composed of reddish-brown, stratified rock. In the background, a range of mountains with red and dark brown hues extends across the horizon. A single person is visible walking along the crest of the ridge, and the scene is illuminated by bright sunlight that casts long shadows across the rugged terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot begins with a person positioned in the center-left of the frame, walking along a sharp mountain ridge that extends from the bottom of the frame towards the center. The ridge occupies the foreground and middle ground, while a vast mountain range fills the background. The camera, positioned above the subject, pulls up and back, following the person as they move along the crest. This movement reframes the ridge to stretch diagonally from the bottom left towards the center, revealing the expansive landscape and causing the person to appear smaller within the vast scene.",
