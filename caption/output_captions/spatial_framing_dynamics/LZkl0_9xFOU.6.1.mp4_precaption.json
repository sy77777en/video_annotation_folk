    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up of a faceless animated figure with pale, featureless skin and short, textured brown hair styled with a side part, wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved t-shirt. The camera arcs clockwise around the humanoid figure before panning right to focus on a black computer monitor. The monitor, branded \"TELESONIC\" on its lower bezel, displays a green-tinted screen with a white-outlined login window containing fields for \"UserID\" and \"Password.\" The camera then moves forward for a closer view of the screen, while the side of the faceless figure's head remains in view on the left, looking toward the screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a room illuminated by a pervasive green light, casting a monochromatic tone over the environment. In the foreground, a computer monitor on a desk displays a login interface with a black background and white-outlined fields for a \"UserID\" and \"Password.\" A black computer tower sits beside the monitor. The background is dimly lit, revealing a dark wooden cabinet, a picture on the green wall, and binders on a shelf. The camera shifts its focus from a figure at the desk to a closer view of the computer screen. An overlay appears in the upper-right corner, stating \"Fictional login data.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a faceless figure positioned in the center foreground against a green background. The camera executes a clockwise arc around the figure's right side and then pans right, transitioning the focus to a computer monitor, which becomes the new subject. In this full shot, the monitor is located in the center-right middle ground, with the side of the faceless figure's head remaining in the left foreground. A computer tower sits to the left of the monitor, while a cabinet and binders are visible in the background. Finally, the camera moves forward, pushing in for a closer view of the monitor screen, which fills most of the frame, while the figure's head stays on the left. The camera remains at the subject's level for both the figure and the monitor.",
