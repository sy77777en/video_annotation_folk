    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with short blonde hair wearing a blue and white checkered dress. A woman with a pink headscarf and a light-colored dress appears partially turned away. A man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants is seen next, followed by a child in a colorful patterned outfit and a red hat. Finally, a door is opened, revealing another person with short dark hair, wearing a white shirt and dark pants. The scene suggests an interaction among the group in a domestic setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set in a bright, vintage-style dining area with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The room features a yellow door that is opened, revealing another room with a window and curtains, adding a retro touch. A large, cream-colored refrigerator stands prominently on the right, with a smooth, glossy surface. A wooden dining table with chairs is visible on the left, contributing to the cozy, domestic setting. The lighting suggests daytime, with natural light filtering through a window, softly illuminating the space. A vase with blue and yellow flowers adds a pop of color on a countertop. The scene captures a moment of activity, with several people interacting, enhancing the lively, familial ambiance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot capturing multiple subjects in a domestic setting. Initially, a woman with short blonde hair, dressed in a blue and white checkered dress, is positioned in the foreground on the right side of the frame. She moves slightly towards the center. As the video progresses, a woman with a pink headscarf and a light-colored dress enters from the left, partially turning away and moving into the middle ground. A man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants then appears in the foreground on the left, engaging with the other subjects. A child in a colorful patterned outfit and a red hat joins near the center, interacting with the adults. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout. In the background, a yellow door opens, revealing another person with short dark hair, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, standing further back in the scene. The large, cream-colored refrigerator occupies the right side of the frame in the foreground, while a wooden dining table with chairs is visible on the left in the middle ground. The vase with blue and yellow flowers sits on a countertop in the background, near the center-right. The camera maintains a consistent perspective, focusing on the interactions among the group without significant changes in shot size or position.",
