    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A clear, lit incandescent light bulb is shown at the moment of impact, shattering in slow motion. The bulb, screwed into a black socket, has a brightly glowing orange filament at its center. Two knives are seen penetrating the top of the glass, causing the bulb to explode into a cloud of flying glass shards and small particles. As the glass breaks apart, sparks fly from the exposed, still-glowing filament. In the blurred background, the chest and lower face of a person wearing a white t-shirt are visible, with their mouth slightly agape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a close-up, slow-motion sequence, an illuminated incandescent light bulb seated in a black socket is pierced from above by a pointed metal tool. The clear glass bulb, glowing with a warm orange light from its filament, shatters violently. Shards of glass and fine particles are sent flying outward, suspended in mid-air. The filament flashes brightly and then breaks as the glass disintegrates. In the out-of-focus background, a person wearing a white shirt is partially visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a close-up, slow-motion shot, an illuminated light bulb in a black socket is fixed in the center foreground. A pointed tool descends from the top center of the frame, penetrating the bulb. Upon impact, the bulb shatters, sending shards of glass and sparks exploding outward from the center, occupying the foreground and middle ground. In the out-of-focus background, the upper body of a person is visible directly behind the central action. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the subject's level.",
