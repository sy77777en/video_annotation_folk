    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a black Mercedes-Benz S550 sedan parked in an outdoor paved area marked with white lines, with several buildings visible in the background, adding context to the setting. The car is viewed from a low angle, slightly behind its rear passenger side. All four of its doors are open, revealing a light tan or beige interior. The car features silver, multi-spoke alloy wheels.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a level-angle perspective close to the ground, the scene is set in a paved asphalt parking lot during the day under a partly cloudy blue sky. A black sedan with a tan interior is parked with all four of its doors open. In the background, there are several single-story white buildings, a chain-link fence, and a distant construction crane. The camera slowly moves backward across the worn pavement, which is marked with white parking lines, away from the rear three-quarter view of the car.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a full, low-angle shot where a black car with its doors open is positioned in the middle ground, slightly right of center. The asphalt pavement, marked with white lines, occupies the entire foreground and extends to the middle ground beneath the car. In the background, several white buildings are visible behind the vehicle, with a tree to the far left and a construction crane to the far right. The camera slowly pulls backward, causing the car to recede slightly further into the middle ground and become smaller within the frame, while revealing more of the pavement in the foreground.",
