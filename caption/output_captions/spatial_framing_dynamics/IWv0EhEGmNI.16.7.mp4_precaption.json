    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a white man with a prominent dark brown mustache and beard, who is shown in a close-up. He is wearing military-style attire, including a dark green beanie, a green jacket, and a lighter green tactical vest with the marking \"G-25\" on the chest. He is engaged in a conversation with a white woman, who is seen from behind, showing her blonde hair styled in a braided bun and a light-colored collared shirt. In the dimly lit background, the blurry figures of other people in military gear are visible inside what appears to be a helicopter. The man gestures with his gloved hand toward his chest as he speaks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a woman with blonde hair in a braided bun, the scene is set outdoors at night in a dimly lit, green-tinted environment, possibly an airfield. In the background, the dark silhouette of a large vehicle, likely a helicopter, is visible with several out-of-focus figures nearby. A man in military attire stands opposite the woman, wearing a dark green beanie and a matching jacket over a grayish-green tactical vest marked with \"G-25\" in black lettering. The man gestures with a gloved hand while speaking. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays subtitles in green and white text, indicating dialogue between characters named Laswell, Kyle, and Price.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a close-up, over-the-shoulder shot, a woman is positioned in the left foreground, with her back to the camera. A man stands opposite her in the right foreground, facing left. In the center background, several out-of-focus figures are visible inside a helicopter. The man on the right raises his gloved hand to his chest. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level.",
