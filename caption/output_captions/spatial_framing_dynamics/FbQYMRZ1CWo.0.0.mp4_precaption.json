    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged, light-skinned man with blondish-brown hair is shown in a close-up shot, appearing stressed or deep in thought. He is wearing a dark suit jacket over a white collared shirt. Initially, he lowers his head and rests his right hand on his forehead, with his fingers running through his hair and his gaze downcast. Subsequently, he looks up, shifting his eyes to the side with his mouth slightly open. At that moment, the image freezes, and the camera slowly zooms in, emphasizing his expression of intense concentration or concern.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV, the scene is set in a dimly lit indoor environment with warm, ambient lighting. A man with light brown hair, dressed in a dark suit jacket and a white collared shirt, is seated at a table. The camera slowly zooms in, tightening the focus on his face as he raises a hand to his temple. The background remains out of focus, showing the indistinct shapes of other people in what appears to be a restaurant or similar social setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The back of another person's head is visible in the left foreground, while the background contains out-of-focus figures. The camera, positioned at the man's eye level, then slowly zooms in, transitioning the shot into an extreme close-up that isolates the man's face in the center of the frame. This movement brings his face from the middle ground to the foreground, while the other elements become excluded from the shot.",
