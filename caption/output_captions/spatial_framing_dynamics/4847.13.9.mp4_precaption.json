    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a man wearing a dark suit and a tall black top hat, who is initially leaning over a table, looking down at a large, light-colored map spread before him, and then stands up straight to look towards an older man. This older man, also in a dark suit and with light-colored hair, stands to the right of the table, facing the main subject and gesturing with his right hand as if speaking. In the background, two other men in dark suits are present; one is in the center, obscured by the main subject, and facing the camera, while another, wearing what appears to be a cap, stands at a counter further to the right, mostly facing away.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors in a room with a black and white color scheme, where the white areas appear as an off-white sepia tone. A large map of the United States is displayed on the back wall, clearly showing the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and states including Texas and Pennsylvania. Adjacent to this map, two framed pictures are hung, both depicting boats, with one also featuring text. A long counter is positioned in the background. In the foreground, a large, gridded map or chart is spread across a table, with a plush armchair positioned behind the table and a man in a top hat. Several men in period attire, including suits, are present, with some gesturing or moving slightly around the maps and counters.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium-full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium-full shot where the main subject, a man in a top hat, is initially positioned in the center foreground, leaning over a large map spread on a table also in the center foreground. To his right in the foreground, an older man stands facing him. An armchair is visible in the left middle ground, behind the table. In the background, a large map of the United States hangs on the center wall, with two framed pictures to its right. Two other men are in the background: one in the center background, partially obscured, and another at a counter in the right background. The main subject then transitions from leaning to standing upright, remaining in the center foreground, and turns his head slightly to the right to look at the older man. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout.",
