    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of men are gathered around a teal sedan that has a sunroof and its passenger-side doors open. On the left side of the car, a man with braided hair stands, wearing a grey graphic t-shirt, ripped blue jeans, and black and white sneakers; he gestures toward the camera with both hands. To his right, another man with braided hair sits on the car's hood, dressed in a black hoodie with a blue and white graphic on the chest, black pants, and yellow and black sneakers. He wears a long chain necklace. The surrounding group of men are mostly dressed in dark clothing, including black hoodies, jackets, and pants. Some wear baseball caps, and one man on the far right is in a black jacket with a red lining, while another wears a black jacket with white designs on the sleeves. The men are positioned around the vehicle, facing in various directions.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in an urban outdoor location on cracked gray pavement. A teal sedan with a sunroof is parked in the center of the shot, surrounded by a group of men in dark clothing. The perspective initially begins at an inverted, eye-level angle and then smoothly transitions to an overhead view, looking directly onto the car and the people. The camera then cranes back down and settles at a hip-level perspective, focusing on two men positioned at the front of the vehicle, revealing a chain-link fence in the background. The lighting is even and diffuse, suggesting it is daytime.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera transitions from an inverted perspective to a top-down view, then to an eye-level view through a craning-down motion, moving around the car and the surrounding people. The main subject, a singer standing in front of a car surrounded by a group of men, initially appears as a distant headshot. As the camera cranes closer, the shot gradually expands into a full-body view of the singer.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera height transitions from level with the subject (at an inverted angle) to above the subject, then back to level through a craning-down motion.",
    "pre_caption": "The shot begins with an inverted, high-angle, top-down view, centering on a teal car surrounded by a group of men on cracked pavement. The camera then rotates 180 degrees to orient the image correctly while maintaining the high-angle perspective. Following the rotation, the camera cranes down and forward, transitioning from a wide shot into a low-angle medium shot focused on two men at the front of the car. In the final composition, one man sits on the car's hood in the center-left foreground, while the other stands in the center-right foreground. The car occupies the middle ground, with the rest of the group positioned around it to the left, right, and in the background, in front of a chain-link fence.",
