    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is presented from the first-person perspective of a figure riding a motorcycle, with pale, stylized hands gripping white, curved handlebars. These hands occasionally shift rapidly between cyan and magenta hues, creating a striking contrast against the dark silhouette of the motorcycle's front end. As the rider progresses, additional motorcycles become visible ahead. Initially, there are two motorcycles, one operated by a driver wearing a red helmet. The changing elevation of the route reveals more motorcycles in the distance as the figure ascends uphill. In the top left corner, a score is displayed in a stylized, glowing font with cyan and magenta numerals that change over time.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moves through a dark, stylized forest at night. The ground is black, and the narrow path is flanked by tall trees exhibiting a range of colors\u2014some are pure white, others vivid cyan, and some in deep, darker shades, creating a stark contrast. The entire scene is bathed in a deep blue glow, with occasional neon pink and cyan highlights on objects and other figures. Transparent heart-shaped crystalline elements with a soft purple aura occasionally collide with the rider, causing the score display in the top left corner to visibly update in a stylized, glowing cyan and pink font. The perspective follows several other figures on similar vehicles as they navigate the winding path through the dense woods.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene is presented from a first-person perspective, with stylized handlebars and hands occupying the bottom-center foreground. The camera moves continuously forward along a dark path that recedes into the center background. Initially, two other motorcycles are positioned in the center middle ground, moving away from the camera. The path is flanked on the left and right by tall, glowing trees that form the background. As the camera advances, the other motorcycles navigate the winding path, and more distant riders become visible in the background. A floating crystalline element appears in the center middle ground before the camera passes through it, while a score remains fixed in the top-left corner of the frame.",
