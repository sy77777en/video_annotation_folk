    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle shot centered on a person's lower legs and feet in the foreground. A red line on the wooden floor runs diagonally from the bottom left to the middle right of the frame, passing beneath their feet. A racket and ball briefly enter the bottom center of the frame as the ball is bounced. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning to a medium close-up that frames the person from the chest up. In this final composition, the subject is positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground, with a white, textured wall occupying the background. A red line is visible along the wall in the top left corner of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially shows the lower legs and feet of a person standing on a wooden court. This person, who has a light skin tone, is wearing white sneakers and white socks. A green racket is used to bounce a small, dark ball on the floor. The view then tilts upward to reveal a young man with dark, wavy hair that falls over his forehead. He is wearing a dark blue t-shirt, blue-gray shorts, wristbands on both wrists, and clear protective glasses, and he is looking down.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place inside a squash court featuring a light-colored wooden floor and white, textured walls. Red lines are painted across the floorboards, indicating specific areas of the court, and additional red lines are visible on the walls at different heights. Yellow sections are located at the bottom corners of the court. A person wearing white sneakers, white socks, and a dark t-shirt stands on the court. The perspective begins with a high-angle view of the person's feet positioned near the red line before tilting upward to reveal their upper body and head.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person using a racket to hit a ball on the ground. Initially, the frame only displays their lower legs and feet, along with the racket and ball. Then, the camera tilts upward to reveal the person's chest-up body, showing a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
