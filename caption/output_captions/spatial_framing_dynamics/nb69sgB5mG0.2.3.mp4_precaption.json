    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned boy with short, light-brown hair and a slender, athletic build walks forward. He is shirtless and wears blue swim briefs with dark blue stripes. He has black guards on both of his wrists and holds a small, crumpled purple and pink cloth in his left hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, the scene is set indoors at a well-lit diving facility. A high, white-tiled wall runs along the right side of the view. To the left and in the background, a multi-level diving platform structure is visible, with spectators seated in distant bleachers. A large red banner with white text reading \"U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM TRIALS\" and \"WE ARE TEAM USA\" is positioned on the left, next to a small wooden table. Metal railings line the walkways and platforms. In the latter part of the video, the facility's ceiling is equipped with several bright white lights that significantly enhance the overall lighting. Initially, the dark, semi-transparent overlay at the bottom of the screen is not visible but appears during the second half of the video, displaying information for a diver named \"JOSHUA HEDBERG,\" including his total score, round number, difficulty, and individual judge scores.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a young boy is positioned in the center-right middle ground. A white tiled wall occupies the right side of the frame, while a large red banner is visible in the left foreground, next to a small wooden table in the left middle ground. In the left background, a diving structure and spectators can be seen. The boy walks forward, moving toward the center of the frame and closer to the camera. As he walks, a dark, semi-transparent graphic overlay appears across the bottom of the screen. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
