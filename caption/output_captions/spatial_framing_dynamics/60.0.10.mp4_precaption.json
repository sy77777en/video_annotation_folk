    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person in the foreground, seen from the waist down, wears black shorts, black socks, and red sneakers. In the midground, a woman with dark skin wears a dark short-sleeved shirt and dark shorts. Next to her, another person with long, light-colored hair is dressed in a dark green shirt. A soccer ball is actively being passed between the players on the court.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place on an outdoor, paved sports court during a sunny day. The greenish-gray surface is marked with worn yellow and white painted lines. In the background, a long wall is covered with graffiti, and urban buildings and trees are visible beyond it. Bright sunlight casts long, dark shadows of people playing soccer across the pavement. The low-angle perspective captures the action at ground level, moving along with the players and the ball.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a low-angle medium shot focused on the legs of a person in the foreground, positioned on the left side of the frame and moving toward the right. In the middle ground, two other players and a soccer ball are visible to the right of the center. A graffiti-covered wall spans the background. The camera tracks the foreground player's movement from left to right, causing the composition to shift and transition into a full shot that reveals more of the players and the court as the action moves toward the center. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
