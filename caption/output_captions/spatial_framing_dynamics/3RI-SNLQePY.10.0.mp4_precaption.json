    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a first-person perspective in a stylized, animated environment. The main focus is on a pair of gloved hands, one holding a device with a digital display showing numbers and a character image, while the other hand is making a finger gun gesture. The viewer appears to be navigating through a corridor lined with industrial elements, including a prominent green caution sign warning of acid. The scene is vibrant, with neon colors and a digital interface overlay, suggesting a video game setting. The environment includes a path with a glowing green liquid, reinforcing the hazardous theme.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, progresses through a long, narrow indoor corridor with a cel-shaded, comic-book art style. The scene is illuminated by a yellowish-green light in some sections, while other sections feature small magenta, four-lobed shaped lights on both sides. The walls have a pattern of circular indentations, and the floor resembles the walls but with rectangular patterns. In the yellowish-green sections, the floor is bright with patterns similar to water in a pool. In the distance, the corridor is lit with a bright neon green. At the beginning of the scene, a red and brown couch is visible. Yellow triangular signs with \"ACID\" and \"CAUTION\" are posted on the walls. The character holds a gray and red device with a green digital display in their left hand, while their right hand is gloved in dark red, covering only the thumb. Various overlays are present, including text on the left that reads \"HEADSHOT +3 sec,\" \"BANNED +2 sec,\" and \"COMBO X3.\" In the center of the view, a black diamond icon appears above the text \"[MOUSE 2] FINISH,\" and multiple instances of \"+2 sec\" text flash.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective at eye level, the scene is framed with the character's hands occupying the bottom foreground; the left hand holding a device is in the bottom-left, and the right hand is in the bottom-right. The camera moves forward through a long corridor that extends from the foreground into the deep background, creating a strong sense of depth. Initially, an enemy figure stands in the centered middle ground at the end of the hallway. As the camera advances, the enemy is knocked to the floor, and the camera moves past them. During this forward motion, the right hand in the bottom-right foreground transitions from a finger-gun gesture to an open palm. Various text overlays appear and disappear: \"HEADSHOT\" is initially in the top-left, later replaced by \"BANNED\" and \"COMBO\" text in the same position, while a \"FINISH\" prompt remains in the center of the frame, and \"+2 sec\" indicators flash in the middle ground.",
