    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a group of elephants in a natural savanna setting. The elephants occupy most of the frame, with their full bodies visible. Initially, an elephant is positioned on the left side of the frame in the foreground, facing right, while the rest of the group is clustered towards the center and right, with their backs mostly turned to the camera. As the video progresses, the elephant on the left moves slightly forward and to the right, altering its position within the frame. The group remains relatively stationary, maintaining their positions in the middle ground. The background consists of sparse trees and distant hills, providing depth to the scene. The camera is positioned at the elephants' level, capturing their interactions and movements within the natural environment. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera height throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of elephants in a natural setting. The elephants are large, with thick, gray skin and prominent tusks. They are gathered closely together, with some facing different directions. The elephants have large ears and long trunks, which are characteristic features. The scene captures the elephants standing amidst tall, dry grass, suggesting a savanna environment. The elephants appear to be interacting with each other, with one elephant slightly separated from the group, facing right. The overall composition highlights the social nature and physical attributes of these majestic animals.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a serene outdoor setting in a savanna landscape during daylight. The scene features a group of elephants standing amidst tall, dry grass. The elephants, with their textured gray skin and large ears, are positioned in a natural formation, with nearly all turned away from the camera and only one facing to the right. Sparse trees and distant hills form the backdrop, adding depth to the environment. The overall atmosphere is calm, with the natural elements and wildlife harmoniously integrated into the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
