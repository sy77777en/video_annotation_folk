    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two people are riding a motorcycle. One person is wearing a white long-sleeved top, light-colored pants, and a dark helmet. The other person is wearing a black jacket with light-colored pants, has long hair, and is not wearing a helmet. The motorcycle appears to be a dark color, possibly black, with an orange or reddish-brown seat.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a winding, paved road cutting through a remote, mountainous landscape under a grey, overcast sky. In the background, a large, sparsely vegetated mountain rises above dense forests of dark green trees that line the lower slopes. The damp road is bordered by grassy verges and a simple wire fence on one side, with patches of reddish-brown foliage and lines of trees on the other side. As a lone motorcycle travels along the road, the drone ascends and tilts downward while continuing to move forward to track the motorcycle's movement around a curve, revealing more of the expansive, hilly terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, two people on a motorcycle are initially positioned in the bottom center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. They are on a paved road that stretches horizontally across the lower portion of the scene, with a grassy area in the foreground and a dense forest directly behind them in the middle ground. A large mountain occupies the background. As the motorcycle travels from right to left along the winding road, the camera, positioned above them, moves forward, ascends, and tilts downward. This dynamic camera movement tracks the motorcycle, keeping it in the bottom half of the frame as it rounds a curve, while revealing more of the road and the surrounding hilly landscape.",
