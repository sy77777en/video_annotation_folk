    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This black-and-white, out-of-focus video pans across a large, tiered, and curved assembly hall. Initially, the rows of desks are empty. As the view shifts, the seats become occupied by a large group of people, who appear to be mostly men dressed in formal attire, sitting at their respective desks. Due to the grainy quality of the footage, individual features are not discernible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a grainy, black-and-white, high-angle shot, the interior of a large, curved assembly hall is shown. The room contains multiple tiers of dark desks or benches arranged in concentric arcs. As the camera pans from right to left, it reveals that the seats on the right side are empty, while those on the left side are already occupied. The footage is blurry, obscuring fine details. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays a timestamp.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, the scene initially shows empty, curved rows of desks in an assembly hall, occupying the middle ground. The camera then pans from right to left. As the pan progresses, the empty rows move to the right side of the frame, and rows filled with seated people become visible, occupying the center and left of the frame, also in the middle ground.",
