    "pre_caption": "In a static medium close-up shot, a man is centered in the frame, visible from the chest up. He is positioned in the foreground, sitting on a brown leather couch that extends across the bottom of the screen. The background is a rustic room with elements in the middle ground and background. To the left, a wooden counter and a small table with a green bottle are visible. Directly behind the man, an opening shows another room with a window. To the right, the background features a counter with a sink and a small birdhouse on a surface. The camera is positioned at the man's eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a middle-aged man with a bald head and light skin, wearing a light blue button-up shirt. He is seated on a brown leather couch, facing slightly to his right, with a neutral expression. His posture is relaxed, and he appears to be engaged in a conversation or listening intently. The setting suggests an indoor environment during the day time, possibly a living room or study, with visible elements like furniture and decor in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a rustic, cozy atmosphere. The environment features wooden walls and a mix of vintage and modern elements, including a wooden table with a green bottle on it. The lighting is natural, suggesting daytime, with sunlight filtering through windows, casting soft shadows. The background includes a homely area with a visible sink and an opening in the wall that leads to another room with a window. A man is sitting on a leather couch, adding to the lived-in feel. The overall color palette is warm, with earthy tones and soft greens, creating a welcoming ambiance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
