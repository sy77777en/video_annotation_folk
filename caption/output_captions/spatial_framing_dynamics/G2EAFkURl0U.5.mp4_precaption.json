    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an outdoor scenery shot of a campground. There is no main subject because the focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of the wooded campground, showcasing multiple log cabins and picnic tables nestled among the trees, rather than highlighting a single specific object or person. The slight pan across the scene further emphasizes the breadth of the setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is an outdoor campground during the day, set within a wooded area. The camera pans slowly from left to right, revealing several log cabins. The closest cabin, constructed from dark brown logs with a green shingled gambrel roof, features a small porch with wooden railings and a dark green door. Adjacent to this cabin, on a gravel area strewn with brown and yellow fallen leaves, are a wooden picnic table with attached benches and a circular black metal fire pit on a stand. Low wooden beams border this gravel patch, which is next to a paved asphalt surface in the immediate foreground. In the background, more log cabins of similar design, some with visible air conditioning units, are nestled among numerous trees with predominantly green foliage, interspersed with some autumn colors. The ground throughout the campground is a mix of grass, gravel, and fallen leaves.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot of a wooded campground, capturing the overall environment and atmosphere. The camera starts with a view of a log cabin in the middle ground on the left, featuring a small porch and a green door. In the foreground, a gravel area with a picnic table and a fire pit is visible, bordered by wooden beams and adjacent to an asphalt surface. As the camera pans slowly from left to right, it reveals more of the campground, including additional log cabins in the background among trees with green and autumn-colored foliage. The cabins are positioned in the middle ground and background, while the trees are scattered throughout, providing depth. The camera maintains a consistent height, level with the cabins, emphasizing the breadth of the setting without focusing on any single element.",
