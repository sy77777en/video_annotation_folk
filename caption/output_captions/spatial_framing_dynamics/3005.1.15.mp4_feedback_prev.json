    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a locker room, a man in the foreground transitions from standing to sitting, wearing a dark blue long-sleeved shirt and dark blue pants. To his right, another man with dark hair sits on a bench, leaning forward to tie the laces of his white sneakers; he is also dressed in a dark blue long-sleeved shirt and dark pants. In the background, a third man, wearing a dark top and light-colored bottoms, moves around in the doorway, facing away from the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit locker room, characterized by rows of tall, gray metal lockers along the left side. Simple benches with wooden slat tops and black metal frames are positioned in the space. The environment is illuminated by a strong, directional light likely shining through windows on the background wall, creating a stark contrast with the deep shadows and highlighting dust motes in the air. The overall color palette is cool, dominated by blues and grays. In the background, an open doorway offers a glimpse into an adjacent area. Several people in dark athletic attire are scattered throughout the room, with one sitting on a bench and another walking in the distance. A gray duffel bag rests on the bench in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
