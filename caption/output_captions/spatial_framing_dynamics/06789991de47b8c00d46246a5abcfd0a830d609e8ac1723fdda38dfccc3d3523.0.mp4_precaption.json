    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two women engaged in preparing food. The woman in the center is wearing a white short-sleeved blouse with yellow patterns and a beige skirt with black patterns. She has her hair styled in a bun with straight bangs and appears to be relatively young. She is looking down at a bowl of noodles on the table. The woman on the right, partially visible, is wearing a blue top and has shoulder-length hair with straight bangs. She seems slightly older and is using chopsticks to add chili to the bowl of noodles. The scene conveys a collaborative cooking activity, with the focus on the preparation of the dish.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a dining room setting. The environment features a wooden countertop with various ingredients, including sliced red peppers and leafy greens. A bowl with a colorful dish is prominently placed on the counter. The background includes shelving that resembles a sideboard, filled with books and pens, suggesting a cozy and functional area. The lighting appears artificial, making it difficult to determine the time of day, but the overall scene remains warm and inviting, with a focus on culinary activity.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows two women. The woman in white is positioned at the center, with her upper body visible. The woman in blue is on the right side of the frame, with only half of her upper body visible. She is using chopsticks to place chili into a bowl of noodles in the lower left corner of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot focusing on two women engaged in a cooking activity. The woman in white, positioned centrally in the frame, occupies the middle ground, with her upper body visible. Her counterpart, dressed in blue, is situated on the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground, with only half of her upper body shown. Both women are at the camera's level, indicating the camera is positioned at their height. The bowl of noodles they are working on is located in the lower left corner of the frame, in the foreground. The background consists of a wooden countertop with various ingredients such as sliced red peppers and leafy greens, along with a shelving unit filled with books and pens, all situated behind the women. Throughout the video, there are no significant changes in the spatial arrangement or shot size; the women remain in their respective positions, with the woman in blue consistently using chopsticks to add chili to the bowl. The camera maintains a steady angle, capturing the collaborative cooking process without any noticeable movement or transition.",
