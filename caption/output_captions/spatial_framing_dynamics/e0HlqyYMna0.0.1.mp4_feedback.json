The snowboarder's shadow is cast into the bottom right foreground. The vast, snowy slope fills the majority of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, where a single track is visible in the center-left.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a snowboarder navigates a vast, snow-covered mountain landscape. The snowboarder's legs, clad in dark pants and boots, are visible at the bottom of the view, strapped to a snowboard that has a black and white graphic design. The board is pointed down a steep, wide slope of white snow, which is textured with ripples and several tracks leading downward. The snowboarder's shadow on the snow reveals that the person is wearing a beanie with a small pom-pom on top, along with winter clothing and gloves. The surrounding environment consists of immense, snow-covered mountains and rocky outcrops under a light blue sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a descent down a vast, snow-covered mountain on a clear, sunny day. The bright sunlight casts a distinct shadow of the individual onto the pristine white snow ahead. The landscape is a wide, open expanse of deep snow, with multiple tracks of varying depth leading down the steep slope. In the distance, towering, jagged mountain peaks, also blanketed in snow, form the horizon. A few dark, rocky outcrops emerge from the otherwise uniform white terrain. The tip of a dark-colored snowboard with white graphics is visible at the bottom of the view as it glides over the textured snow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
