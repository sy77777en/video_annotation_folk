    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a seascape scenery shot. The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the ocean, rocks, and sky. There is no main subject because the emphasis is on capturing the atmosphere and scale of the coastal setting, rather than a specific object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor coastal scene during the day, featuring a rocky shoreline with waves gently crashing against the rocks. The rocks are rugged and varied in size, with a mix of dark and light brown hues, displaying a rough texture. The ocean is a deep blue, with white foam forming as the waves meet the shore. In the distance, a faint outline of land is visible under a clear sky dotted with a few clouds. The setting conveys a serene and natural environment, with the movement of the waves providing a dynamic element to the tranquil landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a coastal seascape. The camera remains stationary throughout, capturing the expansive view of the ocean, rocks, and distant land. In the foreground, large, rugged rocks occupy the bottom left and right corners, extending into the middle ground where they form a natural barrier along the shoreline. These rocks vary in size and color, creating a textured appearance. The middle ground features the sandy beach, which stretches horizontally across the frame, separating the rocks from the ocean. The ocean dominates the upper portion of the video, with waves continuously crashing against the rocks and shore, producing white foam. The background includes a faint outline of distant land under a clear sky with scattered clouds. The camera's height is slightly elevated, providing a broad perspective of the scene without focusing on any particular subject. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the video, maintaining a consistent and stable view of the coastal environment.",
