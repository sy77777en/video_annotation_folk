    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, rendered in an animated style, begins with a blurry, fast-motion perspective of a crowded train car before focusing on a main subject. This central figure is a man with a chiseled, angular face, gray-toned skin, and a stern expression. He has short, dark hair and is dressed in a dark suit jacket over a white collared shirt and a dark tie. A police-style badge is pinned to his left lapel. He stands in the aisle, surrounded by other passengers who are less distinctly drawn. To his left is a person with dark skin wearing a navy and light green coat with a light green \"05\" on it. Another individual with brown hair is partially visible over the main subject's shoulder.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside the narrow aisle of a moving train car, rendered in a stylized, hand-drawn animation. The interior features overhead fluorescent light panels, windows, and handrails. The scene begins with a disorienting, high-speed motion blur that resolves into a clearer view of the passengers within the car. A man with angular features, wearing a dark suit, a white collared shirt, a dark tie, and a badge on his lapel, stands prominently in the aisle. Other indistinct passengers are visible in the background, some holding onto poles for support. The overall color scheme is muted with a greenish-blue tint.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from an eye-level perspective, moving rapidly forward through the center of a train car aisle, with blurred passengers on the left and right. The shot then transitions to a static close-up, focusing on a man in a suit who now occupies the center foreground of the frame. In this final composition, another passenger is positioned in the left middle ground, while the head of a different person is visible over the main subject's right shoulder. Other indistinct figures are located in the background on both the left and right sides of the aisle. The camera remains at the main subject's eye level.",
