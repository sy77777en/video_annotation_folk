    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A first-person perspective from a video game is shown through a green-tinted night-vision scope. The viewer is holding a modern firearm, with its scope and an antenna-like attachment visible in the lower portion of the view. In the distance, a low, rough-hewn stone wall stands next to a dark, leafy bush. Digital interface elements are overlaid on the scene, including an ammo counter in the bottom right corner, additional overlays at the bottom left and center of the screen, and a subtitle at the bottom of the screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, looks out from a narrow, dark space at night, with the entire scene rendered in the monochromatic green of night vision. The perspective is framed by dark structures on the left and right, with the character's rifle visible in the foreground. Directly ahead, a large, dense bush stands next to a low wall made of rough, uneven stones. Several overlays are present on the screen: white subtitles at the bottom display dialogue with the character's name highlighted in red, while a heads-up display shows a vertical bar on the left, an ammunition count with weapon icons on the right, and a battery level indicator at the bottom left.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static, first-person perspective shot. In the foreground, a rifle with a scope is positioned in the bottom center of the frame, with dark, out-of-focus structures framing the view on the left and right sides. In the middle ground, a large bush occupies the center, with a low stone wall to its right. The background is completely dark. Several digital overlays are present on the screen: an ammo counter is in the bottom right, a battery indicator is in the bottom left, a vertical bar is on the left side, and subtitles are at the bottom center. The camera is positioned at the character's eye level.",
