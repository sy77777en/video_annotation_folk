Initially, Tom is in the left foreground, lunging from a sofa located in the center foreground, which has two cushions. Jerry is positioned in the center middle ground, jumping away. Tom then moves to a grey stool in the center middle ground, while Jerry repositions to a desk in the right middle ground, with a wall-mounted television visible in the right background. Subsequently, Tom leaps from the stool towards the television, where Jerry is now seen at the top of the screen, and feathers begin to float in the air. The sequence concludes with Tom, now in the center middle ground, lunging as Jerry jumps from the television towards a round table with flowers in the right middle ground; a striped armchair is also visible in the right foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two animated characters, Tom and Jerry, interacting within a live-action living room setting. Tom, a cartoon cat with blue-grey fur, white paws, muzzle, and belly, and yellow eyes, is depicted energetically chasing Jerry. Jerry, a small cartoon mouse with brown fur, a lighter brown belly and muzzle, and large ears, is shown actively running and jumping to evade Tom. Their chase sequence involves them moving across various pieces of furniture, starting with a light-colored, tufted sofa adorned with two cushions, followed by a grey round stool. In the background, a desk and a wall-mounted television displaying a black and white close-up image of a man's face are visible. The scene also includes a round table with white flowers and two black and white striped armchairs, adding to the dynamic setting of their playful pursuit.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video unfolds in a well-furnished room, likely a living area or hotel suite, as Tom dashes across the light-colored, tufted sofa adorned with geometric and striped pillows. In hot pursuit of Jerry, Tom leaps past a dark console table with gold legs, which supports a large television screen displaying a black and white image of a person, alongside a desk lamp and other decorative items. Jerry scurries around a round grey ottoman, with Tom close behind. The chase continues to the right, where Jerry nimbly dodges a black and white striped armchair and a round white table with flowers. The white walls with wainscoting and a window with curtains blur in the background as feathers float in the air, remnants of their playful chaos. The dim lighting from outside suggests it is nighttime, adding a sense of urgency to Tom's pursuit.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
