    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a time-lapse cityscape scenery shot of a grand, sun-drenched European square. The scene is framed by large, ornate white buildings with brown and green-accented roofs, all under a clear blue sky. At the heart of the cobblestone square stands a prominent, dark bronze monument featuring a central figure on a high pedestal. There is no single main subject, as the time-lapse technique blurs the numerous people walking through the square into streams of motion. This effect intentionally shifts the focus from individuals to the overall bustling atmosphere and the magnificent scale of the surrounding historical architecture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On a sunny day in the In der Burg courtyard of the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, a time-lapse shows a bustling scene. The expansive, paved square is framed by grand, historic buildings with off-white facades, dark roofs, and green copper accents under a clear blue sky. A large, dark bronze monument with a standing figure on an ornate pedestal stands in the center. The movement of numerous pedestrians and a horse-drawn carriage appears as motion blurs, creating streaks of activity across the courtyard as the camera pans slowly from left to right.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide scenery shot captures a bustling European square using a time-lapse effect, which blurs the numerous people moving through the foreground and middle ground into streaks of motion. Initially, the scene is framed by a large, white building on the left and another in the background, with a prominent bronze monument situated in the center middle ground. The camera then performs a slow pan from left to right. This movement causes the building on the left to move out of the frame while revealing more of an ornate, white building on the right. Throughout the pan, the central monument shifts from the center to the left side of the frame. The camera is positioned at eye level.",
