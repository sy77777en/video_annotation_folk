    "pre_caption": "The shot is a medium close-up, featuring a woman on the right side of the frame in the foreground, visible in profile from the shoulders up. A round, ornately framed mirror is positioned on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, initially reflecting her face. Between the woman and the mirror, slightly lower and towards the center-right of the frame, a small statue is visible in the middle ground. The background consists of a light-colored wall with two dark vertical stripes directly behind the woman's head on the right, and faint, painted floral or branch-like designs across the remaining background area. As the woman moves slightly, her reflection disappears from the mirror on the left. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman on the right side of the frame, visible from the shoulders up in profile. She has curly hair and is wearing a light-colored garment. Her face is initially reflected in a round mirror on the left side of the frame, which has an ornate, dark-colored frame. As she moves, her reflection disappears from the mirror. The background includes a decorative wall with a small statue visible next to the mirror.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, with a sepia-toned, monochromatic color scheme. A woman is positioned in profile on the right, looking towards a round, dark, ornately framed mirror on the left. Near the center of the frame, between the woman and the mirror, a small, metallic-looking Buddha figurine with a pointed headdress is visible, positioned lower in the frame than both. The background wall is light-colored and features two dark vertical stripes, likely representing tree trunks, directly behind the woman's face, along with a faint, painted pattern resembling branches or floral designs.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a woman in front of a mirror. She is on the right side of the frame, with only her profile from the shoulders up visible. The mirror is on the left side of the frame, reflecting her face. However, as she moves, her face eventually disappears from the mirror.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
