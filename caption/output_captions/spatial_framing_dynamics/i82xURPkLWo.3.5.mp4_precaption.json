    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a middle-aged man with a bald head and light skin, wearing a light blue button-up shirt. He is seated on a brown leather couch, facing slightly to the his right, with a neutral expression. His posture is relaxed, and he appears to be engaged in a conversation or listening intently. The setting suggests an indoor environment during the day time, possibly a living room or study, with visible elements like furniture and decor in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a rustic, cozy atmosphere. The environment features wooden walls and a mix of vintage and modern elements, including a wooden table with a green bottle on it. The lighting is natural, suggesting daytime, with sunlight filtering through windows, casting soft shadows. The background includes a homely area with a visible sink and an opening in the wall that leads to another room with a window. A man is sitting on a leather couch, adding to the lived-in feel. The overall color palette is warm, with earthy tones and soft greens, creating a welcoming ambiance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video shows a medium close-up shot of a man seated on a brown leather couch. Positioned in the foreground and center of the frame, the man occupies the middle ground, with his upper body and face clearly visible. He faces slightly to his right, maintaining a consistent position throughout the video. The background, featuring wooden walls, furniture, and decor, remains static and out of focus, emphasizing the subject. Elements such as a wooden table with a green bottle are located in the top left corner of the frame, while a sink and an opening leading to another room are situated in the top right. The camera maintains a steady angle at the subject's eye level, capturing the scene without any noticeable changes in shot size or position. The spatial framing keeps the man as the focal point, with the surrounding elements providing context to the indoor setting.",
