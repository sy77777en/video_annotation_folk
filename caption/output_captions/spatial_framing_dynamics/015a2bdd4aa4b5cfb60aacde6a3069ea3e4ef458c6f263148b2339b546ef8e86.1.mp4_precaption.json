    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the natural environment, showcasing the expansive view of the coastline, ocean, and surrounding land. The emphasis is on the scale and beauty of the landscape rather than a specific object, creating an atmospheric and immersive experience.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a scenic coastal landscape. It features a small, rocky peninsula jutting into a deep blue sea, surrounded by clear waters with visible underwater formations. The peninsula is covered with lush green vegetation and houses a solitary, modest building with a light-colored roof, blending naturally with the environment. The coastline is rugged, with steep cliffs and a backdrop of distant hills under a clear sky, suggesting a calm, sunny day. The expansive view highlights the natural beauty and isolation of the setting, with a few boats dotting the horizon, adding a sense of scale and tranquility to the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape, capturing the entirety of a small, rocky peninsula extending into the sea. The peninsula occupies the central and right portions of the frame, with its rugged cliffs and green vegetation forming the foreground and middle ground. A solitary building with a light-colored roof is situated near the tip of the peninsula, positioned slightly off-center towards the left. The deep blue sea surrounds the peninsula, filling the left and bottom areas of the frame, while the background includes distant hills and a clear sky. The camera maintains a high vantage point, positioned above the peninsula, providing a comprehensive aerial view. Throughout the video, there is minimal change in the shot size or spatial positioning, maintaining a consistent perspective that emphasizes the scale and isolation of the coastal environment. The few boats visible on the horizon remain static, reinforcing the serene atmosphere. The camera angle remains steady, ensuring a stable and immersive depiction of the natural scenery.",
