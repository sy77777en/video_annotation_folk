    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A sandy-yellow, weathered airplane with visible rivets along its seams is shown in a close-up view of its cockpit. The word \"RESCUE\" is stenciled in black capital letters below the side window. Inside the cockpit, a woman with dark skin and short, dark, curly hair is seated in the pilot's position. She is wearing a dark tank top, and her upper body is visible as she sits sideways, looking down towards the window beside the cockpit on her left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a close-up view of a weathered, yellow aircraft in flight against a clear blue sky. The plane's sandy-colored fuselage features visible rivets and worn paint, with a black \"RESCUE\" stencil located below the large, multi-panel glass canopy. Through the glass, the utilitarian cockpit is visible, containing a person in the pilot's seat as the aircraft moves over a sunlit, arid environment.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an animated human subject flying a plane. The plane occupies almost the entire frame, presented in about a medium shot. The animated character's upper body is visible, with most of the lower body obscured by the plane.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium shot focuses on a yellow airplane's cockpit, which initially occupies the center of the frame. The pilot is visible inside, positioned in the center-right. A portion of the plane's wing can be seen in the top background, while the word \"RESCUE\" is stenciled on the fuselage in the bottom-left foreground. The camera tracks the plane, panning slightly to the right and shifting its perspective from a front-quarter view to a more direct side profile. This movement causes the cockpit to move towards the right side of the frame by the end of the clip. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
