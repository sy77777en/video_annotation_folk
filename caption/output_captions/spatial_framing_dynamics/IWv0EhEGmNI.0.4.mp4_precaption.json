    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video offers a dynamic nighttime roadscape view from inside a car, with the camera mounted facing forward. The scene captures a dimly lit, rain-soaked rural road bordered by grassy verges and utility poles. The windshield wipers move constantly, adding motion to the view through the rain-speckled windshield. The wet pavement reflects the glare of oncoming headlights and the flashing lights of a stationary police car, creating a moody, atmospheric scene. The focus is on the environment and the interplay of light, weather, and open space, emphasizing the ambiance and scale of the setting rather than a central subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures the scene ahead, showing a rural two-lane road at night with wet pavement reflecting headlights and streetlights. The environment is outdoors, bordered by grassy shoulders and utility poles, with some low vegetation visible along the roadside. The sky is dark, and the road surface glistens from recent rain, with water droplets occasionally visible on the windshield. Several vehicles are present, including two police cars parked in the distance with their roofs flashing alternating red and blue lights. The left-hand car faces the camera, its left and right headlights emitting two beams of light, while the right-hand car faces away. Two guards wave at the camera from the road between them. The windshield wiper is in motion, clearing rain from the glass. Overlay elements include subtitles in the lower center displaying dialogue in white and green text.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot from a fixed, forward-facing camera mounted at dashboard height inside a car, capturing the entire width of a rural two-lane road at night. The road runs horizontally through the center of the frame, with grassy verges and utility poles positioned along the left and right edges in the middle ground and background. The wet pavement, occupying the lower center and bottom of the frame in the foreground, reflects the lights of oncoming vehicles and stationary police cars, which are initially visible in the background and then move into the middle ground as the car approaches. The police cars are positioned on the left and right sides of the road, with their flashing lights illuminating the scene from the middle ground and background. The windshield wiper moves vertically across the foreground, occasionally obscuring the view. Subtitles appear in the lower center foreground. The camera remains at a consistent height, level with the dashboard, and does not tilt or pan, but the spatial relationship between the car and the roadside elements changes as the vehicle moves forward, bringing distant elements into the middle ground and foreground.",
