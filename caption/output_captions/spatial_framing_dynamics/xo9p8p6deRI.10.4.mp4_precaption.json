    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a grayscale, low-polygon 3D animated scene. In the middle ground, a low-polygon, grayscale man stands to the left of a light-colored, low-polygon SUV, which appears to be an older model Ford Bronco. The man is facing slightly to his right, which is the left side of the frame, with his right arm raised and bent, his hand near his head as if holding a phone or gesturing, while his left hand is at his side, possibly in his pocket. The driver's side door of the SUV is open. Inside the SUV, the head and shoulders of another low-polygon, grayscale figure are visible, seated inside the vehicle. The SUV has a spare tire mounted on its rear, and a \"Ford\" logo is discernible on the tailgate. On the far right, the front portion of a second, light-colored, low-polygon vehicle is partially visible. The background consists of low-polygon, grayscale trees and a low fence.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set on a paved suburban street during the daytime, rendered in a monochromatic, low-polygon style. In the middle ground, a light-colored SUV, identifiable as a Ford Bronco by the logo on its tailgate, is parked with its left side door open. A spare tire is mounted on its rear. A gray, low-polygon human-like figure stands beside the open door, while a person is seated inside the vehicle. The ground is light gray, while the road surface is dark gray, with distinct shadows indicating a light source. Behind the SUV, the dark gray road extends from the original direction to the left rear and then turns to extend towards the right side of the frame. To the right, the front portion of a second light-colored vehicle becomes slightly more visible as the video progresses.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins as a full shot, featuring a low-polygon man in the middle ground, left of center, beside an SUV with its driver's side door open, which is positioned in the middle ground at the frame's center. Another figure is visible inside this centered SUV, also in the middle ground. Low-polygon trees are situated in the background, spanning from the left towards the right, with a low fence also in the background behind the man and SUV. A paved surface is in the foreground, while a road in the middle ground extends from behind the SUV towards the left rear before curving towards the right side of the frame. The shot then transitions to a wide shot; consequently, the subjects appear smaller within the frame, and the front portion of a second vehicle, located in the middle ground on the far right, becomes slightly more visible. Throughout the scene, the camera maintains a position at the subjects' level.",
