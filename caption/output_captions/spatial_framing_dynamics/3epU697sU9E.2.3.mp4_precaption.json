    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a dark gray map of the southeastern United States, where landmasses are a darker gray than the surrounding light gray water, and a network of thin white lines indicates routes or borders. Initially, an orange circular marker with a darker orange inner circle highlights \"SARASOTA,\" labeled in orange uppercase text to its right, located on the coast of Florida. An orange dashed line then animates, extending northward from Sarasota along the eastern seaboard. This line connects to a second, identical orange circular marker that appears, labeled \"WASHINGTON\" in orange uppercase text to its right, situated further up the coast.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases a dark, stylized map of the southeastern United States, with state borders and major roads faintly visible as white lines. An orange circular marker with a white outline highlights \"SARASOTA\" in Florida, with the name appearing in glowing orange capital letters to its right. A dashed orange line then animates, extending northwards along the East Coast from Sarasota to another orange circular marker labeled \"WASHINGTON\" in glowing orange capital letters. The background, a dark, slightly textured gray-blue, resembles a digital interface but could also be interpreted as resembling the ocean. The location markers, names, and the connecting line are all overlays on the map.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video displays a static, high-angle view of a dark, stylized map of the southeastern United States, which serves as the background. Initially, an orange circular marker for \"SARASOTA,\" with its name in orange text to its right, is visible as a foreground overlay on the Florida peninsula, positioned towards the bottom center of the map's depicted land area. An orange dashed line then animates as a foreground element, extending northward from the Sarasota marker along the eastern coastline. This line connects to a newly appearing orange circular marker for \"WASHINGTON,\" with its name in orange text to its right, which is situated as a foreground overlay in the upper portion of the depicted coastal region, northeast of Sarasota. All labeled markers and the connecting line remain as foreground elements against the background map.",
