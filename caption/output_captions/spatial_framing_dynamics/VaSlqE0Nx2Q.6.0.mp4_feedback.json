    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, capturing a boy in the middle ground, right of center, as he runs up a grassy hill. A prominent tree trunk occupies the foreground on the left, while other trees are positioned in the middle ground. In the background to the left, a flatter landscape is visible. The camera, positioned at the boy's level, tracks him as he moves from left to right. It then pushes in, transitioning to a medium close-up that centers his upper body and face, causing the foreground and background to blur with the motion. Finally, the camera pulls back to a full shot, showing the boy continuing his run toward the right side of the frame, with the sloped, grassy terrain filling the foreground and middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In this black-and-white video, a young boy is shown running from left to right. He is dressed in what appears to be early 20th-century attire, including a dark, possibly corduroy, jacket, dark knickerbocker-style trousers, light-colored knee-high socks, and dark shoes. On his head, he wears a dark flat cap over his dark hair. The camera tracks him in profile, initially from a distance, then moves closer to capture a medium close-up of his upper body and face, revealing a look of exertion, before pulling back to a full shot as he continues to run.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a black and white outdoor scene, a young boy runs from left to right across a grassy, sloped hill. The camera pans and moves to follow his movement, causing the foreground grass and the tall, dark tree trunks scattered on the hill to appear blurred. In the midground and background, a flatter, lighter-toned landscape stretches out under a bright, overcast sky. As the scene progresses, this landscape shifts leftward and becomes obscured by the hill on which the boy is running. The boy is dressed in a cap, a jacket, and shorts.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera tracks a little boy, starting with a wide shot. As it moves closer to him, it changes to a medium close-up shot, and as he runs away, it transitions into a full shot of him.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
