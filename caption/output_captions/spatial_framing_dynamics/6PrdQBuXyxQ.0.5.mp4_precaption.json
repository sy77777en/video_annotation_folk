    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with blonde hair tied back is seen from behind, hiking up a steep, narrow trail. She is wearing a black long-sleeved top, black shorts that end above her knees, and dark athletic shoes with light green patterns. She carries a black backpack with white markings on its surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A person is seen from behind, hiking up a narrow, grassy trail on a steep mountain ridge during the daytime. To the right of the path is a craggy, gray rock face, and to the left is a steep drop-off into a deep valley surrounded by massive, sheer rock walls. The slope is covered in green grass and small wildflowers. The hiker wears all-black athletic clothing and a black backpack as they move steadily up the rugged path. This is a first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a hiker is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, moving up a narrow path that recedes from the bottom of the frame. To the right, a craggy rock face occupies the right side of the frame, while on the left, a steep grassy slope drops off into a deep valley visible in the background on the far left. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, follows the hiker from behind as they move steadily away from the camera and up the path toward the upper center of the frame.",
