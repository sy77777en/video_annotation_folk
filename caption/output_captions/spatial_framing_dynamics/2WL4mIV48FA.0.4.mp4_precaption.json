    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective mounted just above and behind the driver's head, the video shows a person driving an open-wheel formula-style race car. The car's bodywork is predominantly bright blue, with \"GoPro\" and \"Be a HERO.\" written in white on the section in front of the cockpit, while the nose cone is a silver-gray. The driver is seated in the open cockpit, wearing a white racing suit with black gloves featuring red accents and a black helmet that obscures their face. Their gloved hands are visible on the steering wheel, which is equipped with a small digital display and multiple buttons.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on a light blue, open-wheel race car captures the vehicle speeding along an asphalt track. The track is straight before it curves to the left, flanked by vast, rolling green hills that meet a cloudy, overcast sky. A left turnoff, marked by bright orange traffic cones, indicates it is not the correct path. Small structures or buildings are visible on the left side of the track. The car's body is marked with white text reading \"GoPro\" and \"Be a HERO.\" From this perspective over the driver's helmet, the front wheels and suspension are visible as the car approaches the turn.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a wide shot of a suburban road. The camera is fixed just above and behind a racing driver's head, capturing the car moving forward. The shot only shows the front half of the vehicle, the top of the driver's head, and part of their body; the rest of the frame consists of a road flanked by grass on both sides.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot from a fixed camera positioned just above and behind a racing driver's head, creating a point-of-view perspective. The front half of the race car occupies the bottom portion of the frame in the foreground, with the driver's helmet at the bottom center. The asphalt track extends from the foreground into the middle ground, where it begins to curve to the left. This track is flanked by rolling green hills in the middle ground and background on both the left and right sides of the frame, while a cloudy sky fills the top portion. As the car drives forward, the scenery rushes toward the camera, with the perspective of the track and hills shifting as the vehicle enters the left-hand turn.",
