    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases a futuristic cityscape with a focus on a single, towering structure that dominates the frame. The high-angle shot captures the building as the central subject, around which the environment is constructed. Bright spotlights and glowing red and yellow lights pierce through the rain, illuminating the wet, metallic surfaces and complex industrial architecture, including visible pipes and scaffolding. The scene emphasizes the overwhelming scale and moody atmosphere, creating a strong sense of place and feeling.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a high-angle view of a tall building with an external platform at night. Heavy precipitation, appearing as rain or snow, falls through the hazy air, illuminated by bright white spotlights that cast distinct beams. The platform is adorned with small red circular lights, and a vertical strip of glowing amber lights is visible on the building to the right. Faint details of metallic scaffolding and pipes are observable on the platform, and from this vantage point, one can look down to see a city night view.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of a dark, industrial scene, framed from a high-angle perspective looking almost straight down. A large structure occupies the right side of the frame in the middle ground, featuring a vertical strip of amber lights. Attached to this structure, a metal platform with scaffolding sits in the center. On the left, another large, flat surface defines the edge of the chasm. The foreground is dominated by falling precipitation, which is illuminated by bright white spotlights located at the bottom left and bottom right. Several small, red lights are visible in the middle ground, positioned on the central platform and the structure to its right.",
