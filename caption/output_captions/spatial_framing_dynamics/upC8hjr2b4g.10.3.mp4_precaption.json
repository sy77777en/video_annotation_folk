    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially focuses on an old, beige CRT computer monitor displaying a real-time strategy game. The game shows a map with a light-colored, irregularly shaped landmass, dotted with green elements resembling trees, against a dark, unexplored background. A game interface with text and icons is visible at the bottom and right of the screen. A subtitle overlay appears in the bottom-left corner of the frame throughout the video. As the view widens, a matching beige keyboard and mouse appear on a dark wooden desk in front of the monitor. Subsequently, a white, low-polygon humanoid figure is revealed sitting at the desk, interacting with the computer. This figure, seen from the chest up on the left side of the frame, has stylized, angular features, including curly hair, and its hands are positioned on the keyboard and mouse. The computer's screen remains fully visible on the right of the figure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit room, focusing on a beige, vintage CRT computer monitor placed on a dark wooden desk. The monitor displays a real-time strategy game, showing a map with varied terrain including beige land, green patches representing vegetation, and areas of blue water. A user interface for the game is visible at the bottom of the screen. A beige keyboard and mouse are positioned in front of the monitor. A white, low-poly, stylized human figure appears, with its hands interacting with the keyboard and mouse. An overlay in the bottom left corner of the video displays white text related to the game and its difficulty level.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of a computer screen. Then, the camera moves backward to reveal a humanoid figure using the computer, with their chest-up body visible on the left side of the frame, while the computer remains fully visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a beige CRT computer monitor, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The monitor screen displays a game map, with a light-colored landmass centrally located, surrounded by dark, unexplored areas; game interface elements are visible at the bottom and right edges of the screen display. A subtitle overlay is present in the bottom-left corner of the frame, in the foreground. As the camera pulls back, a beige keyboard and mouse appear in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, resting on a dark wooden desk that occupies the foreground and middle ground. Simultaneously, a white, low-polygon humanoid figure, seen from the chest up, is revealed in the middle ground on the left side of the frame, with its hands on the keyboard and mouse. The computer monitor shifts to the right side of the frame, remaining fully visible in the middle ground. The background is dimly lit and indistinct.",
