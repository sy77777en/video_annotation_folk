    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a mannequin-like figure seated on a chair in a dimly lit room. The figure has a smooth, white surface with geometric contours, resembling a stylized human form. The camera is positioned to the left and slightly behind the figure, which is turned slightly towards its right side. Its hands are placed on the sides of its thighs. The figure is dressed in a two-toned outfit, combining dark and light shades that accentuate its angular design.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a minimalist, dimly lit room. The environment features a tiled floor and a simple, uncluttered layout. A mannequin-like figure is seated on a chair in the center, facing to the left of the frame. The room includes a wooden table with a reflective surface and a cabinet in the background. The lighting is cool and focused, casting shadows and highlighting the figure's geometric form. The atmosphere is quiet and still, with no visible movement or changes. Overlay elements include a small, unobtrusive watermark labeled as \"[26]\" in the lower left corner, which is not part of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static full shot of a mannequin-like figure seated on a chair in the middle ground, positioned in the center of the frame and facing towards the right. In the background, a wooden table is centered behind the figure, and a cabinet is located further back on the right. A large, illuminated screen occupies the right side of the frame in the background, with an empty chair next to it. On the left, a dark rug is visible on the floor in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
