    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Inside a long, arched greenhouse with translucent plastic walls, a wide bed of dark, tilled soil stretches from the foreground to the back. Laid across the soil are several parallel lines of a black drip irrigation hose system. A few weathered, rectangular wooden planks are placed intermittently on the soil bed. At the far end of the bed, multiple dense rows of large, vining plants with broad, dark green, heart-shaped leaves grow vigorously, supported by thin wooden stakes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Inside a long, arched greenhouse with translucent plastic walls, a wide bed of dark, tilled soil fills the space. Several parallel black irrigation hoses run the length of the soil bed, with weathered wooden planks placed intermittently across them. In the background, a row of large, leafy green plants, possibly squash or pumpkin, is supported by wooden stakes. The scene is brightly lit by diffuse daylight filtering through the plastic covering as the camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, capturing more of the greenhouse's interior.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A wide shot, filmed from a low, ground-level perspective, captures the interior of a greenhouse. A bed of tilled soil with parallel black irrigation hoses extends from the foreground at the bottom of the frame through the middle ground. Several wooden planks are positioned across the soil in the middle ground, with one plank in the bottom right foreground. In the background, a dense row of large, leafy green plants spans the width of the frame. The arched structure of the greenhouse is visible along the top and sides. The camera remains stationary but exhibits a slight, unsteady motion.",
