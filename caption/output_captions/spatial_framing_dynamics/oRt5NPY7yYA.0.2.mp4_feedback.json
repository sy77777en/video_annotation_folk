    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme-wide, bird's-eye scenery shot, simulating a satellite perspective. A compound is positioned in the top-center of the frame, with a paved road running horizontally across the upper third of the scene. A large, racetrack-shaped dirt area is located in the center, just below the compound, while the surrounding desert landscape fills the rest of the frame. The camera then gradually pulls back and up, causing the compound and its adjacent features to shrink and shift toward the top-left quadrant. This movement reveals the immense scale of the rugged, mountainous desert, whose textured surface expands to fill the entire frame, making the initial facility appear as a small detail in a vast landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a scenery shot from a simulated satellite perspective, beginning with a bird's-eye view of an isolated compound in a vast desert. The compound consists of several white-roofed buildings clustered together with a small patch of green trees, situated next to a paved road. Adjacent to the buildings is a large, enclosed dirt area shaped like a racetrack. The surrounding landscape is arid and brown, marked by numerous dirt tracks. As the viewpoint gradually pulls back, the compound becomes a tiny feature within an immense, rugged, and mountainous terrain characterized by complex patterns of erosion that create a wrinkled, textured appearance across the expansive desert.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A bird's-eye view captures a remote facility situated in a vast, arid desert. The compound consists of several buildings and some green trees, adjacent to a paved road that cuts through the barren, light-brown landscape. Below the facility lies a large, enclosed area resembling a racetrack or testing ground, with disturbed earth and tracks within its perimeter. Numerous dirt paths crisscross the surrounding hilly terrain. As the camera pulls back, the scene expands to reveal the immense scale of the mountainous desert, its textured surface filling the view.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video simulates the perspective of a satellite camera and begins with an extreme-wide scenery shot. The camera gradually pulls back, revealing an increasingly vast expanse of the terrain.",
