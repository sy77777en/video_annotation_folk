    "pre_caption": "This video is a close-up scenery shot focused on two distinct textures. Initially, the frame is split, with a light tan, grid-patterned surface occupying the foreground on the left. To its right and in the middle ground is a dark, reddish-brown surface featuring a horizontal row of circular indentations. As the shot progresses, the tan surface on the left moves horizontally out of the frame, causing the reddish-brown surface to shift left and eventually fill the entire view. The camera maintains a level, straight-on angle relative to the surfaces throughout this transition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an abstract, close-up scenery shot that emphasizes texture and form over a discernible subject. The composition is split between two contrasting surfaces, with the focus placed on the environment's material qualities to create a mysterious atmosphere. On the left, a rough, sandy-colored surface is marked by a faint grid pattern and dark specks. Juxtaposed on the right and extending behind the sandy-colored surface is a dark, reddish-brown material with a leathery or wooden texture, distinguished by a horizontal row of dark, circular indentations. As the video progresses, the sandy-colored surface on the left gradually moves out of the frame, allowing the reddish-brown material to occupy the entire frame. The dim, warm lighting enhances the tactile nature of the scene, drawing attention to the textures themselves rather than a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A close-up shot reveals two contrasting textures under dim, warm lighting. On the left, a light tan surface with a faint grid-like texture and specks has an irregular edge. To its right and behind is a darker, reddish-brown surface with a vertical seam. A horizontal row of dark, circular indentations is aligned along this seam. The overall color palette is monochromatic, consisting of shades of brown.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
