    "pre_caption": "A wide shot frames a woman standing slightly right of center in the middle ground on a stage. She is positioned on a square red rug that occupies the center of the frame. In the background, a large screen displaying the \"TEDx Vancouver\" logo is visible in the top right. To the top left, a smaller screen shows a live feed of the speaker. Below this smaller screen, a large \"TEDx Vancouver\" sign is positioned in the background on the left side of the stage. The entire backdrop consists of a geometrically patterned wall lit in blue.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned, middle-aged woman with short, dark brown hair in a bob style stands on a stage. She is wearing a sleeveless, knee-length black dress and black mid-calf boots. Positioned on a square red rug, she gestures with her hands as she speaks. Behind her, a large screen prominently displays a red logo with the text \"TEDx Vancouver x=independently organized TED event.\" To her right, a smaller screen shows a live full-body video of her speaking, and beneath this screen, a large \"TEDx Vancouver\" sign is visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on the stage of a TEDx Vancouver event. A woman stands in the center of a square red rug, which is placed on a dark, raised platform. Behind her, two large screens are visible: one displays the \"TEDx Vancouver\" logo, and the other shows a live feed of her presentation. The backdrop is a large, geometrically faceted wall illuminated with a deep blue light. To the left of the stage, the \"TEDx\" part of the logo is in red, while \"Vancouver\" is constructed from large, white letters. On the opposite side of the stage, a cluster of white cylinders is positioned. The overall lighting is theatrical, focusing on the stage and leaving the surrounding area in darkness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
