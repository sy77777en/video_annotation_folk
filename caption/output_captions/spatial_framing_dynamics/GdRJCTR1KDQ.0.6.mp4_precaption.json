    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white aerosol can with a white cap and a red band around its top rests on a grey, rectangular cinder block. The can, which has a small, colorful graphic on its label, begins to spray a white, foamy substance from its nozzle. The force of the spray propels the can into the air, causing it to lift off the cinder block and spin while continuing to eject the white substance in a wide arc across the dry, brown grass. In the background, the front portion of a silver SUV is visible on a concrete driveway.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a residential yard during the day, a white aerosol can with a red label is positioned on a gray concrete block. The block sits on a patch of dry, brown grass dotted with fallen leaves. The can begins to emit a white, misty spray from its sides, causing it to spin and then lift into the air, flying erratically. In the background, a concrete driveway and the front of a silver vehicle are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot begins with a white aerosol can on a cinder block positioned in the center foreground on a patch of dry grass. A concrete driveway sits in the middle ground, with the front of a silver SUV in the top right background. The camera is initially positioned above the can. The can begins to spray, propelling it upwards and towards the left side of the frame while spinning. As the can rises, the camera's perspective changes from being above the subject to being at its level before the can flies out of the frame to the left.",
