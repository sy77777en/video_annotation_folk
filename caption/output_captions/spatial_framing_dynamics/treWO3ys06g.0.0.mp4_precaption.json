    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, whose gender is not discernible, is dressed entirely in black attire, consisting of a leather jacket, pants, gloves, and black shoes. They are also wearing a black full-face motorcycle helmet with a tinted visor that completely obscures their face. Bright yellow patches, which are their socks, are visible on both ankles. The video begins with the person lying face down on an asphalt surface. They then push themselves up, first into a push-up position, then onto their knees, and finally rise to a standing position.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a dark asphalt road in a remote, mountainous landscape under an overcast sky. A steep, mossy hillside, dark green and brown in color, rises directly from the edge of the road, with a small stream of water trickling down its face. In the background, a larger mountain with patches of snow near its peak is visible. A person wearing a black motorcycle helmet and dark clothing is positioned on the road at the base of the hillside.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video first shows a full shot of a person lying on the ground. As he stands up, the camera tilts up, ending with a medium-full shot of the person.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot, where a person lies prone in the foreground on an asphalt road, occupying the bottom half of the frame from the left to the center. In the middle ground, a mossy hillside with a small waterfall on the left fills the upper portion of the frame, while a larger mountain with snow is visible in the background on the top right. As the person pushes themselves up and begins to stand, the camera, positioned at their level, tilts upward to follow their vertical movement. The shot transitions into a medium-full shot, reframing the now-standing person in the lower-left quadrant as the upward tilt reveals more of the background mountain and the overcast sky.",
