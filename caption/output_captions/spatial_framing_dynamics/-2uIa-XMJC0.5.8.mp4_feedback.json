    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of an industrial loft, where a glowing blue spiral structure stands in the left-center middle ground and a large tire rests in the left foreground. The camera moves forward and pans rapidly to the right, revealing the subject. The shot settles into a full shot of a desk setup, viewed from the subject's level. The wooden desk occupies the foreground and middle ground, with a futuristic monitor positioned in the center of the frame. In the background, a cityscape is visible through large windows. On the desk, a pair of binoculars sits in the bottom-left foreground, and a wall with a blue and white pattern is located in the right middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A rapid camera pan through a cluttered, industrial-style loft reveals the primary subject. The space contains a glowing blue, spiral staircase resembling a DNA helix, shelves, and a large tire. The camera settles on a wooden desk set against a large window overlooking a city at sunset. On the desk sits a futuristic, opaque computer monitor with a sleek, silver-colored stand. The screen displays a clear view of a city scene, showing buildings with varied architecture, including one with a turret and another with a sloped glass roof, under a clear sky. A digital overlay on the screen shows a \"NOT RECORDING\" notification in the lower-right corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place inside a spacious, industrial-style loft apartment during what appears to be sunrise or sunset, with golden light streaming through large windows and casting long shadows across the concrete floor. The room is filled with various items, including a prominent, glowing blue staircase shaped like a DNA double helix. The camera pans right through the space and then moves slightly forward, eventually focusing on a wooden desk positioned before the windows. On the desk sits a large, futuristic monitor. This screen displays a live view of a city scene with buildings and a construction crane, overlaid with a digital heads-up display that includes the text \"NOT RECORDING\" and other data in the corners. The background features a cityscape visible through the windows and a wall with a textured blue and white pattern.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
