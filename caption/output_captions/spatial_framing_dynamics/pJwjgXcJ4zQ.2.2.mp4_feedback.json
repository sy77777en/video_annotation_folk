    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures an urban environment with tall buildings lining a narrow street. The focus is on the vibrant atmosphere created by numerous colorful signs and advertisements on the buildings, reflecting a bustling city life. The street is lined with orange traffic cones, and there are people walking, adding to the dynamic urban setting. The emphasis is on the environment and the lively ambiance rather than any specific object or individual.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an urban street scene in Kabukicho, Tokyo, during the early evening or possibly early morning. The setting is outdoors, featuring a bustling street lined with tall buildings. The architecture includes modern structures with glass facades and brick exteriors. Brightly lit signs with Japanese characters adorn the buildings, adding vibrant colors to the scene. The street is of normal width but becomes narrower where orange traffic cones block a portion of the sidewalk, guiding pedestrian flow. The sky is clear, transitioning from day to night, casting a soft blue hue. The environment is lively, with people walking along the street, and the atmosphere is typical of a busy city district.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
