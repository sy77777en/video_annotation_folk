    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged, light-skinned man with a light-colored goatee is shown in a close-up, in a skydiving posture. He is wearing a light-colored helmet with red and black lettering, dark sunglasses, and a black wingsuit. The suit has yellow and white sleeves with a black skull design on the white fabric wings of his suit, and a blue strap is visible across his chest. He looks directly at the camera with an intense expression and his mouth slightly open initially, extending his arms to spread the fabric wings of his suit and then withdraws both hands to hold two blue straps that extend from the strap across his chest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to a person, the scene captures a wingsuit flight through a vast, rocky mountain range during the daytime. The sky is bright. The person, wearing a light-colored helmet and dark sunglasses, is seen from a close, wide-angle perspective as they glide through the air. They extend their arms, unfurling the fabric wings of their suit, which are white and black with a skull graphic on the inner surface. Below and in the background, the craggy, grey mountain faces, interspersed with patches of green vegetation, are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a man's face positioned in the center foreground, with a rocky mountain range visible in the background below him. He then extends his arms outward, causing the wings of his suit to expand and fill the bottom left and bottom right portions of the frame. This action transitions the view to a medium shot that encompasses his upper torso and outstretched arms. The camera maintains a fixed, high-angle position relative to the man's body, looking down at him as the mountain scenery rushes past in the background.",
