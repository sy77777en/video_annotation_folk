    "pre_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective, with the lower center of the frame consistently occupied by the black firearm, which remains in the foreground throughout. The heads-up display overlays are fixed in the frame: the mini-map and player information are in the bottom left foreground, the ammunition count is in the bottom right foreground, and orange diamond-shaped objective markers appear near the center foreground. The scene begins with the viewpoint positioned behind a dark structure on the left foreground, with the two-story building in the middle ground, slightly right of center, and trees and bushes distributed in the background on both sides. An explosion occurs near the left foreground, producing a cloud of dust and smoke that partially obscures the view. The camera then moves forward and slightly right, transitioning from the open area into the shadowed area at the base of the two-story building, shifting the building to occupy more of the center and right middle ground. The camera height remains at the eye level of the player character, maintaining a consistent perspective relative to the environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a first-person shooter game scene. The main subject is a player holding a black assault rifle. The rifle itself is sleek and modern in design. Separately, there is an overlay on the screen displaying ammunition count and other data, which is not physically attached to the rifle but part of the game's user interface. The player navigates through an outdoor environment featuring a two-story building with a staircase on the exterior. The building is surrounded by trees and open space. On-screen graphics include a mini-map and player information, indicating a multiplayer setting. The player moves towards the building, suggesting an objective or exploration within the game.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, takes place in a bright, sunny, outdoor environment with an arid, dusty landscape. The setting features a two-story, unfinished concrete building with open window frames, surrounded by scattered trees and green bushes. The viewpoint starts behind a dark structure with \"7208-JITE\" stenciled in white. A large orange explosion erupts near this structure, kicking up a cloud of dust and smoke, which may infer the viewpoint player being shot. Following the explosion, the viewpoint moves to the shadowed area of the two-story building. The scene is overlaid with a heads-up display (HUD), which includes a circular minimap in the lower-left corner, an ammunition count in the lower-right, and orange diamond-shaped objective markers in the central view. The lower portion of the view is consistently occupied by a black firearm.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
