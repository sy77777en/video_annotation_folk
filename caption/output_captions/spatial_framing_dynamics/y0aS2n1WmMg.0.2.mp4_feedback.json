    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a white door positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, flanked by a brown curtain in the left foreground and a dark shelf in the right middle ground. The door opens inward, revealing a man in a close-up shot, framed centrally in the doorway at the camera's level. He steps into the middle ground and closes the door, causing his figure to become a dark silhouette against the faint light of the door's arched window. He pauses briefly in the center of the frame before turning and walking from the middle ground toward the foreground, his silhouette growing larger until it moves out of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on a white door with a frosted, arched window, which then opens inward to reveal a light-skinned man. He has light brown hair pulled back into a bun and is wearing a black t-shirt under a tan jacket. He steps into the dimly lit room, and as he moves closer to the camera, his figure becomes a dark silhouette against the window.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor entryway, a white door with an arched, frosted glass window at the top is centered. A brown curtain hangs to the left, and a dark wooden shelf is positioned in front of a wall with peeling paint. A man with his hair tied back enters from the brighter exterior, pauses briefly, and closes the door, casting the space into near darkness. He stands in silhouette against the window's faint light before turning and walking deeper into the house.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a close-up shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
