    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents an interior scenery shot, showcasing the inside of a yurt. The camera pans around, revealing a furnished space with a bed covered in a patterned duvet, a small kitchenette area with a counter and stools, a blue chest of drawers, a grey armchair, and a grey sofa. The yurt's structure, with its wooden lattice walls and radial roof beams, is visible throughout. There is no main subject as the focus is on capturing the overall environment, atmosphere, and layout of the yurt's interior rather than a specific object or person. Towards the end of the video, a portion of a hand briefly appears in the bottom left corner of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, panning across the interior of a furnished yurt. The circular structure features exposed wooden lattice walls and a conical roof with wooden beams lined with white fabric, supported by two wooden poles positioned on either side of the foot of the double bed. The space is carpeted in dark grey with a light grey rug in the center. Furniture includes a double bed with patterned bedding featuring red, white, and grey Christmas-themed gnomes, and grey towels. A blue wooden three-drawer dresser, a blue fabric armchair with a brown furry throw, and a dark grey sofa are also present. As the camera continues panning left, it reveals a wooden counter accompanied by a mini-fridge and two light-colored wooden stools. A tall, light-colored wooden cabinet is also visible. White electric heaters are mounted on the walls, and various small decorative items, including Christmas gnomes, are placed around the room.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a scenery shot, capturing the interior of a yurt without a specific main subject, presented as a wide shot. Initially, a blue chest of drawers is positioned in the center-left middle ground, a grey armchair in the center-right middle ground, a wooden cabinet on the right middle ground, and a kitchenette area on the left middle ground, with a light grey rug in the center foreground. The camera then pans smoothly to the left. During this pan, the armchair and cabinet exit the frame to the right, while the blue chest of drawers shifts to the right background. The kitchenette, now showing two stools and a mini-fridge, moves from the left to the center-right background. A double bed enters from the left, becoming prominent in the center and then center-right middle ground, accompanied by a small table at its foot and a central wooden roof support pole visible in the foreground/middle ground. Finally, a grey sofa enters from the left, occupying the left foreground and middle ground. Throughout the pan, the yurt's wooden lattice walls and radial roof beams consistently form the background. Towards the end, a portion of a hand briefly appears in the bottom left foreground. The camera is positioned at approximately eye level.",
