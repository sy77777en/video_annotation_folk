    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a coastal landscape scenery shot, capturing the expansive view of a serene beach with gentle waves lapping against the shore. A prominent rocky hill covered in patches of greenery rises on one side, contrasting with the deep blue of the ocean and the bright sky, which features a large patch of clouds on the right side near the horizon, while the rest of the sky is entirely clear. The focus is on the natural beauty and tranquility of the environment, emphasizing the vastness and peacefulness of the scene rather than any specific object or subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a serene coastal scene during the day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a sandy beach with gentle waves lapping against the shore. The ocean is a vibrant blue, contrasting with the light tan of the sand. On the left side of the screen, a prominent rocky hill covered in patches of green vegetation rises near the shoreline, adding texture and depth to the landscape. To the right of the hill, a patch of clouds is visible in the distance, while the rest of the sky remains entirely clear, indicating calm weather. Two people can be seen walking on the beach, appearing very small and not the main focus of the scene. The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view of the coastline, highlighting the natural beauty and expansive openness of the area.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features an extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape, capturing the expansive view of a serene beach. The sandy beach stretches across the bottom of the frame, with gentle waves lapping against the shore in the foreground. A prominent rocky hill covered in patches of greenery is positioned on the left side, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. The ocean occupies the middle ground to the right, with its vibrant blue contrasting against the light tan of the sand. In the background, a large patch of clouds is visible on the right side near the horizon, while the rest of the sky remains clear. The camera, positioned at a high angle, provides a sweeping view of the coastline, emphasizing the natural beauty and vastness of the scene. The two people walking on the beach appear very small and are not the main focus of the scene.",
