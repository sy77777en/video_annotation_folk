    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young girl with light skin and dark hair stands on the wet, circular balcony of a weathered, white, cylindrical structure. She wears a red hood over a patterned tunic in shades of orange and brown, along with grey pants and dark boots. She opens a weathered white door, steps fully onto the balcony, and looks up into the falling rain with her hands clasped together in front of her chest before spreading both hands open.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures the balcony of a weathered lighthouse during a storm. The scene is set on a circular, black metal walkway that wraps around the lighthouse, which is constructed from large, light-gray metal panels marked with rust stains. It is daytime, but the sky is obscured by heavy fog and falling rain. A single, worn door opens, and a person in a red-hooded garment steps out onto the wet walkway and looks up into the rain.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, framing a young girl on the center-left of a circular balcony that occupies the middle ground. The weathered wall of the lighthouse structure is visible in the background. The camera slowly pushes in, transitioning to a full shot of the girl. As the camera moves, she opens a door behind her and steps fully onto the balcony, moving slightly forward and toward the center of the frame. The shot concludes with the girl centered in the frame, standing in the middle ground, with the camera remaining at her level throughout.",
