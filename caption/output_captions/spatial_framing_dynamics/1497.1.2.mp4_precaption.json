    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man's hand holds a small, folded piece of light green or grey paper between his thumb and index finger. The man wears a black suit jacket and a white dress shirt with the cuff visible at his wrist. To the right of the hand, a light tan or beige tablecloth is visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a person's hand holds a small, folded, light-green piece of paper. The individual, wearing a black suit jacket and a white cuffed shirt, is seated on furniture with dark, patterned upholstery. The surrounding environment is dark and out of focus, with a light-colored beige surface visible to the right. A \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" watermark is present as an overlay in the bottom left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man's hand holding a small, folded piece of paper is positioned in the center foreground. The man's arm, clad in a black suit and white cuff, extends from the center towards the left. Below the hand, dark, patterned upholstery occupies the bottom foreground. To the right, a beige surface is visible in the middle ground. A watermark is located in the bottom left corner as an overlay. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
