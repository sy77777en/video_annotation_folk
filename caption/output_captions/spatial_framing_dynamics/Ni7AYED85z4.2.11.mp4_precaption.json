    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black, mirrorless Sony camera is mounted on a tripod in the foreground, with its flip-out screen angled out to the side. A light-skinned hand is visible holding and adjusting the camera. The camera is pointed across a body of choppy, greenish-blue water toward a distant cityscape. The city, featuring low-rise buildings and a prominent domed or spire-topped structure, is partially obscured by a thick, gray fog under an overcast sky. A small boat is visible on the water in the distance. The camera's screen shows a dark reflection of a person and a building.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a view across a body of choppy, green water on a foggy day in Venice. In the distance, the city's skyline, including a prominent church with a domed or pointed roof, is partially obscured by the thick, gray mist. A small boat moves leftward on the water in the mid-ground. In the foreground to the right, a hand, initially partially visible, holds a black Sony camera mounted on a tripod. As the camera pans, the hand becomes fully visible on the right, and the camera later shifts from the right to the center-right. A portion of a green post is initially partially visible on the far left edge but eventually moves out of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "In a first-person perspective shot, a black camera on a tripod is positioned in the foreground on the right, with its screen angled out. A green post is visible in the foreground on the far left. The middle ground is composed of choppy green water, upon which a small boat travels from right to left. In the background, a distant cityscape is visible through a thick fog. As the video progresses, a hand enters from the right to hold the camera in the foreground. The overall point of view pans slightly to the right, causing the green post to move out of the frame and the camera to shift from the right to the center-right of the composition.",
