    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a somber coastal scenery shot depicting the upper portion of a dilapidated lighthouse against a stormy sky. The tower, made of a pale, weathered material, shows signs of disrepair with boarded-up windows and crumbling sections. It is topped by a dark, caged lantern room. The focus of the scene is on the oppressive atmosphere rather than the structure itself, with heavy rain slanting across the frame and a turbulent, murky green sky creating a bleak and desolate mood. The lighthouse serves to enhance the sense of isolation and decay within the harsh environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A weathered, light-gray lighthouse stands against a dark, turbulent sky during a heavy downpour, with rain falling in white streaks across the scene. The octagonal tower shows signs of disrepair, featuring boarded-up windows and broken sections of masonry. At its peak is a dark, caged lantern room. Behind the structure, the sky is a gloomy expanse of swirling green and gray clouds as the view slowly tilts upward along the height of the dilapidated tower.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot of scenery featuring a lighthouse. Initially, the middle section of a dilapidated lighthouse is positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. A turbulent, green-hued sky occupies the background, while streaks of rain fall in the foreground across the entire scene. The camera, positioned at a low angle, slowly tilts upward, following the height of the tower to reveal its dark, caged lantern room at the top. Throughout this movement, the lighthouse remains stationary on the right side of the frame.",
