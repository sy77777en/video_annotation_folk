    "pre_caption": "This video presents a close-up, high-angle shot of a long passenger train car. The train car is positioned diagonally, extending from the bottom left towards the top right, occupying the center of the frame, and is situated in the middle ground. The background consists of a blurry green and brown landscape filling the remaining area of the frame. Initially, the train car's roof is opaque. Subsequently, the roof becomes transparent, revealing the detailed internal layout of the car. Throughout this transition, the train car maintains its consistent diagonal position and size within the center of the frame, as the camera remains stationary relative to the moving train.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents an aerial, diagonal view of a long, light gray passenger train car moving towards the upper right corner of the frame, while the camera remains stationary relative to the train. Initially, the roof of the train car is opaque, featuring small, evenly spaced, square-like indentations. The sides of the car are a darker gray or blue-gray, with multiple small, rectangular windows, and black lines demarcate the divisions between car sections. The roof then becomes transparent, revealing the detailed internal layout. The interior consists of numerous compartments, including narrow corridors, small private rooms (some equipped with bunk bed-like structures and fixtures resembling sinks or toilets), and larger communal areas. These communal spaces are furnished with small, dark gray, circular tables and L-shaped seating. The internal walls are primarily white or light-colored, while the flooring varies between a light brown or wood-like material and gray. Shadows of trees and the train are visible on the ground, suggesting that the sunlight is coming from the upper left corner. The train car is shown against a blurry, textured background of green and brown, indicative of land.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an overhead view of a long, segmented passenger train with a light gray roof, featuring regularly spaced dark rectangular elements, moving across a blurred green and brown landscape. Initially, only the exterior of the train is visible. Subsequently, a semi-transparent overlay appears, revealing a cutaway diagram of the train's interior, detailing compartments, corridors, and various rooms, while the train continues its motion.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
