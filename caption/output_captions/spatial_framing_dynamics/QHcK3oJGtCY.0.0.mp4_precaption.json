    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a static, eye-level shot of a desert scene where five large black camels and a smaller white camel walk from left to right, passing the camera one by one. Each large camel is only partially visible as they move across the frame, with half of their bodies captured at a time\u2014first showing their right side and then their left. In contrast, the smaller white camel is fully visible within the frame as it passes. The camels are distinguished by their size and color, with the larger ones being black and the smaller one white, creating a striking contrast against the sandy desert backdrop.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a vast desert landscape with undulating sand dunes under a sky filled with many clouds. The setting is outdoors, characterized by the warm, golden hues of the sand stretching into the distance. The terrain features gentle slopes and ridges. A line of camels is present, moving across the scene, contrasting with the sandy backdrop. The overall atmosphere is serene and expansive, highlighting the natural beauty and isolation of the desert environment.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a static, eye-level shot of a desert scene where five large black camels and a smaller white camel walk sideways to the right, passing the camera one by one. The frame only captures half of each large camel's body at a time, first their right side and then their left side as they move across. However, the smaller white camel's entire body fits within the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a static, eye-level shot capturing a desert scene where five large black camels and a smaller white camel walk from left to right, passing the camera sequentially. The shot size is such that only half of each large camel's body is visible at a time, initially showing their right side as they enter the frame from the left and then their left side as they exit towards the right. These camels occupy the foreground and middle ground, moving horizontally across the frame. The smaller white camel, in contrast, is fully visible within the frame as it passes, also in the foreground. The camels maintain a consistent horizontal path, with their movement creating a dynamic flow from left to right. The background consists of undulating sand dunes extending into the distance, filling the upper portion of the frame. The camera remains at the camels' level throughout, providing a clear view of their movement against the expansive desert backdrop. The spatial positioning of the camels shifts from left to right, while the desert scenery remains constant, emphasizing the camels' traversal through the scene.",
