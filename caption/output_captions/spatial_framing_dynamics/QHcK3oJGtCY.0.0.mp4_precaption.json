    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a static, eye-level shot of a desert scene where five large black camels and a smaller white camel walk from left to right, passing the camera one by one. Each large camel is only partially visible as they move across the frame, with half of their bodies captured at a time\u2014first showing their right side and then their left. In contrast, the smaller white camel is fully visible within the frame as it passes. The camels are distinguished by their size and color, with the larger ones being black and the smaller one white, creating a striking contrast against the sandy desert backdrop.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a vast desert landscape with undulating sand dunes under a sky filled with many clouds. The setting is outdoors, characterized by the warm, golden hues of the sand stretching into the distance. The terrain features gentle slopes and ridges. A line of camels is present, moving across the scene, contrasting with the sandy backdrop. The overall atmosphere is serene and expansive, highlighting the natural beauty and isolation of the desert environment.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a static, eye-level shot of a desert scene where five large black camels and a smaller white camel walk sideways to the right, passing the camera one by one. The frame only captures half of each large camel's body at a time, first their right side and then their left side as they move across. However, the smaller white camel's entire body fits within the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is captured from a static, eye-level perspective, showing a desert scene. Five large black camels and one smaller white camel traverse the scene from the left to the right side of the frame, moving through the middle ground. The framing for the large black camels is a medium close-up, showing only the rear half of their bodies as they enter from the left and then the front half as they exit to the right. In contrast, the smaller white camel is captured in a medium shot, with its entire body visible as it walks across the frame. The immediate sandy terrain occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the background, a large sand dune is positioned in the upper left and center, with a cloudy sky filling the top portion of the frame.",
