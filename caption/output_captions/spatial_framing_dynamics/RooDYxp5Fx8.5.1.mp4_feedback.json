    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static wide shot of a city street scene. The sidewalk occupies the foreground and middle ground, stretching from the bottom left towards the center. A white \"SOMPO\" sign stands in the foreground on the far left, next to a grey-tiled building that lines the left side of the frame. A woman is seen in the left-middle ground, walking away from the camera along the sidewalk. A multi-lane road fills the middle ground on the right, where a silver van is parked at the curb. Other buildings are visible in the middle ground and background across the street, with a green mountain rising in the distant background at the center. The upper portion of the frame is filled with a blue sky and clouds. The camera is positioned at eye level and remains stationary throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a bright and tranquil cityscape scenery shot from a sidewalk in a Japanese city. The scene unfolds along a wide, paved sidewalk next to a multi-lane road with light traffic, including a silver van parked at the curb. A woman with dark hair, wearing a black shirt and blue jeans, walks away from the camera. The street is lined with modern buildings of varying heights, one of which features a prominent white sign with the \"SOMPO\" logo. In the distance, lush green mountains are visible under a brilliant blue sky filled with scattered white clouds, adding a natural element to the urban landscape. There is no main subject; the camera's static, wide perspective emphasizes the overall environment and peaceful atmosphere of the city on a sunny day, rather than focusing on any single person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a walk along a wide sidewalk in a Japanese city under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds. To the left stands a modern building with a grey-tiled facade, fronted by a white sign with the \"SOMPO\" logo and Japanese text. The sidewalk, paved with grey and yellow tactile tiles, runs parallel to a multi-lane road with moving traffic, including a silver van parked at the curb and a white taxi further down. Across the street, other contemporary buildings line the cityscape, with a lush, green mountain visible in the distance. A woman wearing a black top and blue jeans walks ahead on the pavement.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
