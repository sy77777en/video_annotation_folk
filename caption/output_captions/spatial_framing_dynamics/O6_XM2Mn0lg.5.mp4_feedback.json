    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit setting, two armored figures are engaged in combat. The figure on the left, clad in dark, metallic-looking armor highlighted with blue accents on the chest and shoulders, is holding a long, straight-bladed sword with both hands and striking towards the figure on the right. The sword emits a faint blue metallic glow. The figure on the right stands in a defensive posture, wearing similar dark armor with faint greenish highlights. Both figures are fully helmeted, obscuring their faces.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dense, dark forest at night, under very low light conditions. Tall, slender trees with bare branches create an enclosing background, their forms mostly lost in deep shadows. The ground is uneven, and a single sword is partially embedded in the forest floor at an almost vertical angle, positioned between the two figures. In a small, dimly lit clearing, two figures in dark armor are engaged in rapid combat. Their movements are swift, and their forms are partially illuminated by a cool, faint light that catches on their armor, creating brief flashes of blue and white against the pervasive darkness. As the camera advances and arcs clockwise, only the hilt of the sword is visible in the lower left corner of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
