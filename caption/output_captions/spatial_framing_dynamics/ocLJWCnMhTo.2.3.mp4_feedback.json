    "pre_caption": "Initially, a medium shot frames the scene at the subjects' level, with a person in a white robe occupying the left-foreground, seen from behind. This person holds a child, who is positioned in the center-middle ground, while a man in a red shirt stands to the right in the middle ground. The camera then moves upward and tilts down, transitioning to a high-angle perspective. In this final composition, the person in the white robe is at the bottom of the frame in the foreground, the child is in the center-middle ground, and the man in red is at the top-right middle ground. This movement makes the black and white checkered floor a dominant element in the background, also revealing a small, clear table in the center-bottom middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with light brown, shoulder-length hair, seen mostly from behind, wears a white robe-like garment with a large, dark blue graphic on the back. This individual is holding a child who has dark, possibly dreadlocked hair and is wearing a green short-sleeved shirt with a yellow graphic on the front. Standing nearby is a man with dark skin and a shaved head, who is dressed in a red long-sleeved shirt and is looking forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene is characterized by a prominent black and white checkered tile floor. The space is furnished with transparent chairs and a small, clear table. The entire video is presented with a grainy, low-fidelity aesthetic, featuring a distinct greenish color cast and soft focus, reminiscent of old analog footage. The camera's perspective shifts during the clip, moving from a medium shot to a high-angle view that looks directly down upon the checkered pattern of the floor. The scene is framed by black vertical bars on the left and right sides.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
