    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a wide view of a Venetian canal. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on the overall atmosphere and environment of the location. The composition emphasizes the expansive, vibrant blue-green water and the sense of place, with a yellow water taxi serving as a dynamic element within the larger scenic context.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, observational perspective, a yellow and white water taxi travels across a wide canal of blue-green water, creating a small wake. Several clusters of weathered wooden posts stand in the water. As the camera zooms out, a diverse array of buildings densely lines the riverbank in the middle ground, with a few people visible walking along the waterfront during the daytime. In the background, another section of the river and more buildings are revealed.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.",
    "pre_caption": "This scenery shot begins as a high-angle wide shot, with a yellow water taxi moving from the bottom left towards the right in the middle ground. The canal's water fills the lower two-thirds of the frame, with several wooden posts also in the middle ground. A waterfront walkway and buildings occupy the background at the top of the frame. The camera then zooms out to an extreme wide shot, causing the elements to appear smaller and revealing more of the surrounding buildings and another section of the canal in the background.",
