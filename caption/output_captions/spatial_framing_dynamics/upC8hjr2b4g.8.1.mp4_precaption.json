    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, faceless person with short, black, curly hair and light gray skin is shown running in the foreground. This individual is wearing a short-sleeved blue t-shirt and dark pants. Surrounding and running alongside this person is a crowd of other human figures. These figures, which include both male and female forms, are all rendered in a uniform gray, low-polygon, geometric style, making them appear like statues. They are also faceless and lack any detailed features, with their clothing integrated into their angular forms. The entire group is depicted in the act of running forward together.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a misty, blue-gray environment at dawn, a group of low-polygon figures runs forward. The figures in the crowd are monochrome gray and semi-translucent, all moving in the same direction. A single figure near the front is distinguished by a blue t-shirt and black pants. The ground appears uneven and resembles a brown, earthy surface, while the background looks like a natural wall with patches of greenery, shrouded in fog.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium shot, initially at the subjects' level, frames a group of running figures. A person in a blue shirt is positioned in the center-left foreground, surrounded by numerous gray, low-polygon figures that occupy the foreground and middle ground across the frame. In the background, a misty, wall-like structure is visible. As the scene progresses, the camera pulls back and moves upward to a higher angle, while the entire group of figures runs forward, moving from the center of the frame toward the background.",
