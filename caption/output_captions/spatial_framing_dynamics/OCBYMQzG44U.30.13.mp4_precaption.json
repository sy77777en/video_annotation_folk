    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an interior scenery shot of a stark, modernistic room. The space is defined by its curved walls, which feature a two-tone design with a dark, textured lower section and a smooth, off-white upper portion that blends into the ceiling where several recessed lights cast a soft, greenish-hued glow. A striking geometric pattern of large white and black tiles dominates the floor, and a narrow, arched doorway is visible in the distance. There is no main subject, as the focus is deliberately placed on the architectural space itself. The wide, low-angle perspective emphasizes the room's unusual curves, stark contrasts, and enigmatic, empty atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moves through a large, unfurnished indoor space. The room features curved walls, with the lower portion finished in a dark, textured material and the upper portion, along with the ceiling, in a lighter off-white. The floor is laid with a bold geometric pattern of a large white tiled area bordered by glossy black tiles. Several recessed spotlights and a larger circular fixture illuminate the room from the ceiling. The perspective shifts to the left, providing a comprehensive view of the entire room. **\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static, low-angle wide shot of an empty, modernistic room. The foreground and bottom half of the frame are dominated by a floor with a large white tiled area in the center, framed by black tiles on the left and right. In the middle ground, dark, curved lower walls extend across the frame, with lighter-colored upper walls above them. A narrow, arched doorway is visible in the center-background, while the ceiling, featuring several lights, occupies the top of the frame.",
