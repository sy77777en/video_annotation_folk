    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a sports car with a striking red, blue, and white color scheme. The front of the car displays large numbers, \"+30\u00b0\" and \"-30\u00b0,\" prominently on the hood. The car's sleek design includes aerodynamic curves and a visible logo on the front. In the latter part of the video, the car is seen from the rear, showcasing its dynamic shape. The car is in motion, with snow being kicked up around it, indicating it is driving on a snowy surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a dynamic outdoor scene on a snowy track. It features a sports car with a striking red, blue, and white color scheme, prominently displaying numbers and markings on its sleek, aerodynamic body. The setting is a wintry landscape with snow-covered ground and a backdrop of tall, dark evergreen trees. The time of day appears to be midday, with the sun casting a bright glow, creating a contrast between the car's vibrant colors and the white snow. The car is in motion, kicking up snow as it speeds along the track, emphasizing the sense of movement and energy in the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of the sports car, capturing most of its body while it is in motion on a snowy surface. Initially, the car is positioned slightly off-center towards the left side of the frame, with its front facing the camera. The car occupies the foreground, with the snowy track and evergreen trees forming the background. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a full shot, showing more of the car's surroundings. The camera moves from an initial position above the car to aligning at the car's level, providing a clearer view of its side profile. The car continues to move from left to right across the frame, maintaining its central position. The snowy track remains in the middle ground, while the trees stay in the background, creating depth in the scene. The camera captures the dynamic movement of the car as it kicks up snow, emphasizing its speed and the texture of the snowy surface.",
