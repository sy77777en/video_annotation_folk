    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a cityscape scenery shot, offering an aerial perspective of densely packed, multi-story buildings with varied roof styles and colors, including gabled, flat, and hipped roofs in shades of grey, black, red, white, etc. The focus is on the overall urban texture and architectural patterns rather than a singular subject, emphasizing the scale and layout of the city block. Straight, intersecting roads run between the blocks, with vehicles traveling on them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone offers an aerial perspective of a densely packed urban environment during what appears to be an overcast day. The scene is dominated by the rooftops of multi-story buildings, which are closely aligned along narrow streets. These rooftops vary in color and shape, including shades of dark grey, light grey, dark brown, reddish-brown, and dark blue, with one prominent flat white roof. Some buildings feature balconies and visible chimneys or ventilation systems. The streets below show a few parked or slowly moving vehicles, including a white van. The overall color palette is characterized by low saturation with dark tones. The drone's movement provides a slow, sweeping view across the architectural landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is an extreme wide scenery shot. Initially, the frame captures a dense urban landscape from a high aerial perspective, with a prominent street running diagonally from the bottom left towards the top right, serving as a central axis. Buildings in the foreground occupy the bottom of the frame, while the middle ground is defined by the buildings lining this central street and intersecting streets, and the background consists of more buildings extending towards the top of the frame. As the shot progresses, the camera slowly moves forward and slightly to the right, causing the foreground elements at the bottom to gradually exit the frame. Consequently, the middle ground elements, including the central street and its adjacent buildings, shift towards the bottom of the frame, while new urban structures and street sections continuously enter from the top, maintaining the expansive aerial view of the cityscape.",
