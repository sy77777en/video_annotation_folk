    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A gameplay scene from a cooperative cooking video game is shown from a top-down perspective. The scene features two small, cartoonish chef characters, both wearing pink hats and white uniforms. They are positioned within a brightly colored, outdoor kitchen layout. The user interface is prominent, with a row of food order tickets at the top, a score and multiplier in the bottom-left corner, and a countdown timer in the bottom-right. The order tickets depict items like hot dogs and sundaes, along with icons for their specific ingredients. The kitchen itself contains various cooking stations, ingredient dispensers, and a central moving platform.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video, the scene is set at a vibrant, outdoor street festival during the daytime. The central focus is a large, white, rectangular conveyor belt platform surrounded by wooden cooking stations equipped with stoves, sinks, and ingredient dispensers. The paved ground is scattered with confetti, and the area is decorated with blue and yellow balloons, festive banners, and palm trees, creating a tropical ambiance. Small, cartoonish chef characters move around the kitchen area, while other characters wait behind a counter at the top of the scene. A heads-up display is visible as an overlay. Across the top, several panels depict food orders with their required ingredients. The bottom-left corner shows a gold coin icon with a score of 532 and a tip multiplier, while the bottom-right corner features a timer counting down.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is presented in a wide, top-down shot. A user interface overlays the scene, with food order tickets spanning the top of the frame, a score in the bottom-left foreground, and a timer in the bottom-right foreground. The central focus of the middle ground is a large, white, rectangular conveyor belt that moves from right to left, surrounded by cooking stations. Two chef characters are positioned on opposite sides of this central platform; one moves around the left side, and the other moves around the right. In the background, at the top of the frame, customers wait behind a counter. The periphery of the scene is decorated with festival elements, including a palm tree in the bottom-left foreground and balloons scattered throughout the middle and background.",
