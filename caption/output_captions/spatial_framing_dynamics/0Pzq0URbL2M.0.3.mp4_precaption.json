    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a person in a white lab coat visible through a building's open doorway, standing inside the room. The focus then shifts to two men outdoors. Both men are light-skinned; the man on the left is younger with short dark hair, and the man on the right is older with short white hair. They are wearing beige jumpsuits and black boots, clinking green glass bottles together. As the camera pulls back, two young boys with dark hair come into view, both wearing light blue t-shirts and purple shorts. They are barefoot and engaged in a game of tug-of-war, pulling on opposite ends of a thick rope near a narrow pool of water. The scene maintains visibility of the two men with bottles as the boys appear.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors during the daytime, in a yard in front of a large, multi-story institutional building with a light-colored facade and numerous dark, rectangular windows. A single figure in a white coat is visible standing just inside an open doorway of the building in the first part of the video. An overlay of white subtitle text initially appears in the bottom-left corner of the screen and later disappears. After the camera pulls back, in the foreground, a lawn with grass and bushes surrounds a rectangular swimming pool. Two children in blue shirts and purple shorts are barefoot, playing tug-of-war with a thick rope near the pool. Nearby, two men wearing tan jumpsuits and black boots stand beside the pool.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video uses camera movement and focus shifts to transition between three subjects. It begins with an extreme wide shot of part of a building, where a person in white clothing is visible through a door. As the camera moves backward, it passes two light-colored-clothed individuals clinking beer bottles, gradually revealing their full bodies. The camera continues to move back, passing two blue-clothed individuals engaged in a tug-of-war, eventually bringing them fully into view while shifting focus onto them.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot where a large building occupies the middle ground, extending from the center to the top left of the frame, with a person visible inside a central doorway. The camera then pulls backward, revealing two men who enter the central foreground. As the camera continues to dolly out, it passes the men and brings two boys into the immediate foreground, with one positioned on the bottom left and the other on the bottom right. The focus simultaneously shifts from the men to the boys, who are playing tug-of-war across a narrow pool that stretches horizontally across the lower portion of the frame. In the final framing, the boys are the primary subjects in the foreground, the two men are now in the center middle ground, and the building is in the background. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
