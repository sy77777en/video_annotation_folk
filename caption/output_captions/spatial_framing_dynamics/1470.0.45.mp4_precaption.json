    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a fair-skinned man with short, dark hair who appears agitated. He is wearing a distinctive yellow and brown V-neck cardigan with a chevron pattern over a collared shirt and a patterned tie, paired with dark trousers. He moves quickly into view from behind a brick fireplace, gesturing with his hands and with his mouth open as if shouting. Throughout the video, a woman with short blonde hair in a blue and white checkered dress is mostly visible behind him, occasionally ducking out of sight. On the wooden mantelpiece above the brick fireplace, a dark-colored shotgun with a wooden stock and a green toy tractor are visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors within a room characterized by dark wood-paneled walls and a prominent red brick fireplace. A wooden mantelpiece sits atop the fireplace, holding a green toy tractor and a shotgun. The room is warmly lit by a lamp with a pleated orange shade, and a framed picture hangs on the paneled wall. In the background, a doorway opens into another part of the house. A man in a yellow and brown cardigan moves from behind the fireplace into the room, while a woman in a checkered dress is briefly seen moving near the brick wall.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In this medium shot, a man in a yellow cardigan initially emerges from behind a brick fireplace positioned in the right foreground. He moves from the right side of the frame toward the center-left, occupying the middle ground. As he moves, a woman in a checkered dress appears briefly behind him in the middle ground on the right before ducking back behind the fireplace. A wooden mantelpiece holding a toy tractor and a shotgun is visible in the right foreground, above the fireplace. The background is composed of a wood-paneled wall on the left and a doorway to the center-right. The camera remains static and at the subjects' level.",
