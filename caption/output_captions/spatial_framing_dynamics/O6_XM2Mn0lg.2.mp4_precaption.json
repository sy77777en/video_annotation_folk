    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a man suspended in the sky, partially illuminated by a strong beam of light. He is dressed in dark, heavy clothing that appears rugged and practical, with visible straps and armor-like elements, suggesting protective gear. His face is mostly obscured by shadows, but his posture is alert and tense. The scene then transitions to another man, who is crouched low to the ground. This second man also wears dark, protective clothing with metallic or leather components, and his body language indicates caution or readiness, as he appears to be bracing himself or preparing to move. The switch between subjects occurs through a shift in focus, moving from the man in the sky to the crouched man, both of whom share similar attire and a sense of preparedness, but are distinguished by their poses and the way they are lit.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors in a dense, shadowy forest at night, with the ground covered in a layer of snow or frost that reflects the limited ambient light. Tall, bare trees with dark, rough bark and tangled branches dominate the environment, creating a sense of enclosure. The lighting is dim and bluish, with a strong beam of light cutting through the darkness in one section, casting long shadows and illuminating patches of the snowy ground. The air appears cold and still, with no visible precipitation or wind movement. The overall color palette is muted, consisting mainly of dark blues, grays, and blacks, contributing to a stark, wintry atmosphere. No overlays, text, or digital elements are present within the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot showing the first man suspended in the sky, positioned near the center-right of the frame and occupying the middle ground, with a strong beam of light entering from the left and extending across the frame into the background. The snowy ground and tall trees fill the lower and side portions of the frame, with the trees extending from the foreground to the background, creating depth. The camera is at the same height as the suspended man, capturing him from a level angle. The scene then transitions to a wide shot of the second man, who is crouched low in the bottom left of the frame and situated in the foreground, while the snowy forest and trees recede into the background and fill the rest of the frame. The camera remains at the subject\u2019s level, maintaining a consistent perspective. The switch between subjects is achieved through a shift in focus and framing, moving from the elevated, central position of the first man to the lower, left position of the second man, while the spatial relationship to the forest environment remains consistent.",
