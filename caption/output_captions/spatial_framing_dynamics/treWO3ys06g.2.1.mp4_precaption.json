    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two people are riding a dark-colored, cruiser-style motorcycle. The driver, wearing a light blue jacket and a dark helmet, is positioned in the center of the view. A passenger, not wearing a helmet, is seated directly behind the driver. The motorcycle's single, round headlight is illuminated, casting a bright reflection on the wet surface of the road.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A motorcycle with its headlight illuminated travels along a narrow, wet paved road that cuts through a desolate, rural landscape. The scene is set under a heavily overcast sky, with a thick layer of gray fog obscuring the distant rolling hills. The terrain on either side of the road consists of low hills covered in muted brown and dark green grass. The dark, wet surface of the road reflects the single bright light from the front of the motorcycle as it moves forward.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a motorcycle carrying two people is positioned in the center of the frame, initially in the middle ground, traveling forward along a narrow road that extends from the bottom of the frame. On the left and right, grassy hills occupy the middle ground, with more distant, fog-covered hills in the background. As the motorcycle moves towards the camera, it remains centered and grows larger in the frame, transitioning from the middle ground into the foreground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
