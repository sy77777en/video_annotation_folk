    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the video, a person with light skin is wearing a purple shower cap with cucumber slices over her eyes, relaxing in a white, claw-foot bathtub filled with white bubbles. Only her head and the top of her shoulders are visible above the bubbles. She is wearing a pair of orange headphones, appearing to enjoy herself. A small yellow rubber duck is placed on the windowsill near the person's head.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor scene of a bathroom during the day. Bright sunlight streams through a large window fitted with horizontal blinds and partially covered by a patterned shower curtain. Central to the room is a white, clawfoot bathtub filled with soapy bubbles, where a person is bathing. To the left of the tub, a toilet is visible, along with a towel hanging on the wall. To the right, an upright metal radiator stands beside the tub, and further along the wall, a blue towel hangs above a green wicker bench holding a folded pink towel. The room features slanted walls, indicative of an attic or upper-level space, and has areas of brightness and shadow created by the strong light from the window.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a person sits centrally in a bathtub located in the middle ground of the bathroom. The bathtub itself occupies the center of the frame, also in the middle ground. To the left, a toilet is positioned in the middle ground. To the right, a radiator stands in the middle ground, next to a wicker bench further right, also in the middle ground. A blue towel hangs on the right wall in the middle ground/background, above the bench which holds a pink towel. A window is visible in the center background, partially covered by a shower curtain hanging to its left in the middle ground/background. A small rubber duck sits on the windowsill to the right of center in the middle ground/background. Slippers are visible in the bottom center foreground. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout.",
