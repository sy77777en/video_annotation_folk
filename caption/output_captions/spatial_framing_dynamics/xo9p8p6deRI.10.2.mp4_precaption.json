    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, presented in black and white, shows the interior of a light-colored, older-model car, viewed from the front through its windshield. Inside, two dark gray, low-polygon, human-like figures are seated. The figure on the right, in the driver's seat, is turned to their right, engaging in conversation with someone seated in the back of the car. The other figure, positioned on the left side of the frame, is also in the back of the car, conversing with the person in the front. Both stylized figures are faceless and rendered with angular geometry.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, rendered in a monochromatic grayscale, shows the interior of a car from a viewpoint looking in through the windshield, providing a detached, observational perspective. Two dark gray, low-polygon, angular figures are seated inside on light gray seats: one behind the white steering wheel and the other in the passenger seat. The car's simple interior includes a rearview mirror, steering wheel, wipers, and seats. Blurry, light gray trees visible through the windows indicate an outdoor, daytime setting. Yellow text overlays appear at the bottom center: initially \"[...]\", then changing to dialogue \"Please, listen to me, listen to me O.J., listen to me.\", followed by \"[...]\", and concluding with \"O.J., No, No, O.J.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a medium shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is viewed from outside the front windshield, looking into a car. Initially, it is a medium shot of the first subject, the driver, who is positioned on the right side of the frame in the middle ground, behind a white steering wheel. The car's hood and windshield wipers occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A second subject is seated in the back on the left side of the frame, also in the middle ground. A rearview mirror is visible in the top center, middle ground, and blurry trees form the background seen through the car windows. Yellow text is overlaid in the bottom center foreground. The framing transitions to become a medium shot of the second subject in the back. Throughout, the camera remains at the subjects' level.",
