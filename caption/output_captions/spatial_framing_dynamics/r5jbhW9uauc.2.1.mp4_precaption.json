    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This abstract video features plumes of vibrant pink and cyan liquid suspended and intermingling against a solid black background. The liquids form large, billowy, cloud-like structures, with the pink mass primarily on the upper left and the cyan mass on the right, blending into shades of purple where they meet. The substances appear viscous, with thick tendrils and streams dripping downwards, while smaller, distinct droplets of both colors also fall through the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a solid black background, vibrant pink and cyan liquids billow and swirl, forming large, cloud-like masses with a smoky, ethereal quality. As these formations slowly descend, the colors mix to create shades of purple. Thin tendrils and distinct droplets of both pink and cyan drip downward from the main formations, falling through the dark space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "In this abstract shot, large, billowy masses of pink and cyan liquid occupy the upper half of the frame, set against a black background. The pink mass is positioned primarily in the top-left and center, while the cyan mass is on the top-right, with both occupying the middle ground. Throughout the scene, the main formations slowly descend. From these central masses, viscous tendrils and smaller droplets of both colors drip and fall vertically downwards through the center and foreground, moving towards the bottom of the frame. The camera maintains a static, straight-on position, capturing the downward flow of the liquid from a perspective at or slightly below the main formations.",
