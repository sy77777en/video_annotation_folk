    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A skier wearing a bright red jacket, black pants, and a black helmet performs a jump off a snow ramp. The skier approaches the ramp holding ski poles and then launches into the air. While airborne, the skier's body is twisted, but the video concludes with their legs extended parallel to the ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On a bright, sunny day, a skier in a red jacket glides across a wide, snow-covered mountain slope. The scene is set against a backdrop of a blue sky with white clouds and distant, tree-dotted mountains. The skier approaches a large snow ramp and launches into the air, seen mid-flight against the bright sun and sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a skier is initially positioned in the center-left middle ground on a snow-covered slope, with a large snow ramp occupying the foreground from the bottom-left to the right. The background consists of a mountain on the left and a bright sky filling the top and top-right of the frame. The camera is positioned at the skier's level. As the skier launches off the ramp, the camera's perspective shifts to a low-angle shot from below the subject. In the final framing, the airborne skier is in the center-left middle ground, silhouetted against the sky which now fills the upper portion of the frame, while the snowy landscape is relegated to the bottom.",
