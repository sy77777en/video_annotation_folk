    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, black, cylindrical object, resembling a bomb or missile, is shown horizontally. It has a semi-circular tapered nose at one end and a flat, squared-off tail section at the other. The body of the object is segmented, with visible lines of rivets or fasteners marking the seams between sections. It is supported by four curved, metallic arms that extend upwards from a rectangular, metallic base. The base is flat, with a shiny top. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a close-up of a black, cylindrical object resembling a bomb or torpedo, resting horizontally on a metallic silver stand. The object has visible rivets along its seams and a tapered nose. At the rear, what appears to be a fin or stabilizer is partially visible. The stand consists of a tray base with rounded edges and several curved metal supports cradling the object. The scene is dimly lit, with a focused light source illuminating the top surface of the black object, creating a sheen. The background is out of focus, suggesting an indoor, possibly industrial or workshop setting. White subtitles in the bottom left corner display small numbers. **\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot, where the right portion of a black, cylindrical object is positioned in the center of the frame, extending towards the left, in the middle ground. Below it, a metallic stand is visible in the center-bottom, also in the middle ground. The background is out of focus. The camera then pans to the left, transitioning to a full shot. In this final framing, the entire cylindrical object is horizontally centered in the middle ground, with its tapered nose on the left and its squared-off tail section on the right. The metallic stand remains in the center-bottom, in the middle ground, supporting the object. The camera is at the subject's level.",
