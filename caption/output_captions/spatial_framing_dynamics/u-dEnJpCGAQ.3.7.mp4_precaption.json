    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A leopard with a tan coat covered in black rosettes is seen walking on a slight incline of dry grass and reddish dirt. The large cat has a muscular build and a long tail that curls up, revealing the white underside. It moves cautiously from the right side of the frame, heading towards the bottom left. The leopard continues walking until it is completely obscured by the foliage and disappears from view.\n\n**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunlit, natural landscape, a leopard moves down a gentle slope of reddish-brown earth mixed with dry, yellowed grass. A dense thicket of green bushes and taller, straw-colored grasses is situated in the middleground and background. As it proceeds, it lowers its body and disappears from the bottom left, with its tail visible for a moment before it is fully concealed by the foliage.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a leopard positioned in the right middle ground on a dirt and grass slope. A dense thicket of green bushes and tall grass occupies the background and the left side of the frame. The leopard moves diagonally from the right towards the bottom left, entering the foreground. It continues walking until it is completely obscured by the foliage at the bottom left, disappearing from the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
