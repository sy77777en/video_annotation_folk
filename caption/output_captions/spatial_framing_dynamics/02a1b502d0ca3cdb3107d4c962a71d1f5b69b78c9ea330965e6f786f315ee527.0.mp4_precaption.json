    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a pair of hands manipulating a deck of playing cards. The hands, with light skin tone, are actively engaged in holding and sorting through the cards, which include various suits such as hearts, spades, and diamonds. The cards are standard playing cards, with visible numbers and suit symbols. The hands are positioned centrally, focusing on the cards being held and shuffled. To the right, a stack of cards lies on a flat surface, with one card partially visible, showing a colorful design. The interaction between the hands and the cards is the primary focus, highlighting the act of card handling.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of a person holding and examining a hand of playing cards. The setting is indoors, with a neutral, light-colored surface serving as the backdrop. The cards are standard playing cards, featuring a mix of red and black suits, with visible numbers and symbols. A deck of cards is placed on the table, partially visible, with a card face-up next to it. The lighting is even, suggesting a well-lit room, and the focus remains on the hands and cards, emphasizing the interaction with the deck.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a pair of hands manipulating a deck of playing cards. The hands are centrally positioned in the foreground, actively engaged in holding and sorting through the cards, which display various suits and numbers. To the right, a stack of cards lies on a flat surface, partially visible, with one card face-up showing a colorful design. The hands and cards remain the primary focus throughout, with the camera positioned above them, emphasizing the interaction. The background consists of a neutral, light-colored surface, providing a simple backdrop that keeps attention on the card handling. The spatial composition remains consistent, with the hands and cards maintaining their central and foreground positions, while the stack of cards stays in the background on the right.",
