    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a bustling urban street scene with several pedestrians and various storefronts. People of diverse appearances are walking along the sidewalk, some wearing casual clothing like jeans and jackets, while others are workers in uniforms with yellow highlights and helmets. A man in a denim jacket and cap, wearing a face mask, is prominently visible walking towards the camera. Brightly lit signs and advertisements adorn the buildings, adding vibrant colors to the scene. Traffic cones line the street, indicating possible construction or restricted areas. The overall atmosphere is lively, with a mix of individuals engaged in their daily activities.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, capturing a bustling urban street scene in a narrow alley lined with tall buildings. The setting is outdoors, likely in a city known for its vibrant signage, as colorful neon signs and advertisements adorn the buildings. The time of day appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, with natural light illuminating the scene. The street is flanked by a variety of shops and restaurants, their windows displaying bright posters and menus. Orange traffic cones line the sidewalk, guiding pedestrians and indicating ongoing maintenance or construction. The pavement is entirely asphalt, with varying degrees of wear creating the impression of different sections. People walk along the street, some wearing casual attire, contributing to the lively atmosphere. The overall environment is dynamic, with a sense of movement and activity typical of a busy city street.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of an urban street scene, showcasing a narrow alley lined with tall buildings. The camera remains at eye level throughout, providing a consistent perspective. In the foreground, orange traffic cones are positioned along the left side of the frame, stretching from the bottom left towards the middle ground. These cones guide the viewer's attention down the street. Pedestrians occupy various positions within the frame; a man in a denim jacket and cap walks towards the camera from the middle ground, moving from the center-right towards the bottom right. Other pedestrians appear further back, scattered across the middle ground and background, walking in different directions. Storefronts and brightly lit signs fill the right side of the frame, extending from the bottom right into the background. Workers in uniforms with yellow highlights and helmets are visible near the left side of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The camera maintains a steady position, capturing the dynamic flow of people and the vibrant urban environment. The spatial arrangement emphasizes the depth of the alley, with the foreground, middle ground, and background clearly defined by the placement of objects and individuals.",
