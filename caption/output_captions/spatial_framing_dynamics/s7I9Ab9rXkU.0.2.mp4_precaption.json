    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a dark complexion and a full beard, wearing a dark brown hat positioned low above his eyes, with the brim flipped upward. Beneath the hat, he has a black head covering that conceals his hair and ears. He is wearing a light-colored jacket over a patterned shirt. The microphone, likely mounted on a stand, is held close to his mouth, suggesting he is singing or speaking. His facial expression appears engaged and focused, with his eyes partially closed. The man is positioned prominently, indicating he is the central subject of the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors, featuring a warm, intimate environment with soft lighting that creates a cozy atmosphere. The background includes wooden elements, possibly shelves or paneling, adding to the rustic charm. The setting suggests a relaxed, perhaps musical venue, with a microphone prominently in the foreground. The time of day is not explicitly clear, but the lighting suggests an evening or dimly lit setting. The overall color palette is warm, with earthy tones and soft textures, contributing to a welcoming and comfortable ambiance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a man, capturing him from the shoulders up. The subject is centrally positioned in the frame, with his face and upper torso occupying most of the shot. The microphone is located in the foreground, slightly to the right of the center, near the bottom of the frame. The man's head and shoulders are in the middle ground, while the background consists of wooden elements, such as shelves or paneling, which are out of focus and occupy the top and back portions of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout the sequence, maintaining a consistent perspective. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the elements within the frame. The man's head moves slightly, turning towards the right side of the frame in some frames, but the overall framing remains stable.",
