A large body of water dominates the frame, extending from the foreground through the middle ground. Positioned in the bottom right foreground is a peninsula where numerous boats are gathered near a small structure.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features a landscape scenery shot, depicting a wide expanse of calm water, likely a lake or reservoir, dotted with small, exposed landmasses and islands under a soft, hazy sky tinged with pink and grey clouds. In the distance, a large, flat oasis and a faint horizon line add depth to the scene. Numerous long, narrow boats are clustered along a spit of land jutting into the water, near a small, simple structure. The shot lacks a single main subject because its purpose is to convey the vastness and atmosphere of the environment; the focus is distributed across the expansive water body, the distant flat terrain, the arrangement of the boats, and the quality of light, emphasizing the overall scale and tranquil mood rather than highlighting any particular object or individual.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an expansive aerial view of a large, calm body of water under a cloudy sky with soft pink and purple tones, indicating either dawn or dusk. The setting is outdoors, featuring low water levels that reveal several small, tan-colored landmasses and islands protruding from the greenish-brown water. In the lower right, numerous long, narrow, dark-colored boats are gathered along the shore of a peninsula, near a small, simple structure with a brown roof. The surrounding terrain is predominantly flat, resembling an oasis or plain, and stretches towards a faint horizon line in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
