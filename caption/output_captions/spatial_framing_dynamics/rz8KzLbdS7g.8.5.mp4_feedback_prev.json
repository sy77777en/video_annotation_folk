    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot capturing a serene residential neighborhood. In the first frame, the camera is positioned at street level, providing a view of the street that runs from the bottom center to the top center of the frame. Houses line both sides of the street, with a silver van parked on the left in the foreground. The houses are positioned in the middle ground, with vibrant greenery and neatly trimmed gardens surrounding them. The sky occupies the background, with clouds casting soft shadows. In the second frame, the camera shifts to focus on a house on the left, capturing its entrance and garden in more detail. The house is in the foreground, with the garden extending to the bottom of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's height throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective of the neighborhood's peaceful ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a neighborhood scenery shot, capturing a quiet residential street lined with houses. The focus is on the environment, highlighting the peaceful atmosphere and the charm of suburban life. The scene features well-maintained homes with neatly trimmed gardens, vibrant greenery, and a clear blue sky, creating a serene and inviting ambiance. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the overall setting, allowing viewers to appreciate the harmonious blend of architecture and nature.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, capturing a serene residential neighborhood on a sunny day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a quiet street lined with well-maintained houses. The houses are primarily two-story structures with light-colored facades, surrounded by lush greenery and neatly trimmed hedges. A silver van is parked on the left side of the street, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. The sky is partly cloudy, allowing sunlight to cast soft shadows on the ground. The street is paved, with a mix of concrete and cobblestone paths leading to the house entrances. Vibrant green plants and blooming flowers, including hydrangeas, enhance the tranquil atmosphere. The overall environment is peaceful, with a sense of suburban calmness.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
