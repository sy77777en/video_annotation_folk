    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features an interior scenery shot of a modern office, framed through a large, rectangular opening in a brick wall. The scene's focus is on the environmental transformation of the space rather than a single subject. Initially, the room is furnished with a sleek white and black desk, a brown leather couch, a whiteboard on an easel displaying an architectural drawing, and a painting with splashes of blue and red on a black background on the right wall. As the video progresses, cardboard boxes gradually fade into view, obscuring most of the furniture. Several items, including the whiteboard, the painting, and the lamp on the desk, fade out of sight, suggesting they are being packed into the boxes, signifying that the office is being packed up.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Viewed through a rectangular opening in a brown brick wall, a modern office with light-colored, vertically paneled walls is initially visible. The space contains a white and dark desk, modern chairs, a brown leather sofa, and a small coffee table. An easel on the left displays an architectural drawing of a house, and a colorful abstract painting hangs on the right wall. The scene transitions as cardboard moving boxes fade into view, gradually filling the room and obscuring the furniture until the office is cluttered with stacked boxes, one of which is marked with the letters 'R-F'. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text '[18]'.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a fixed, eye-level wide shot of a modern office, viewed through a rectangular opening in a brick wall that occupies the foreground. The video focuses on the environmental transformation of the space. Initially, the middle ground contains an easel with a drawing on the left, a desk in the center-left, and a brown leather couch on the right, all set against a paneled background wall. As the shot progresses, cardboard boxes gradually fade into view across the middle ground, appearing on and around the furniture. The boxes eventually obscure most of the desk, chairs, and couch, while the easel on the left and a painting on the right wall fade out completely, transforming the furnished office into a cluttered space filled with moving boxes.",
