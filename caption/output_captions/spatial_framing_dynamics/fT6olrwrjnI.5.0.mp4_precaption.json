    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with fair skin, slightly tousled black hair, and wide black eyes is shown from the chest up. He wears a white sleeveless sweatshirt with blue and purple stripes over a long-sleeved black undershirt, with a white insignia on his left bicep. His mouth is open, and he looks directly at the camera. Partially visible behind him is the back of another person wearing a red jersey, though the letters on the shirt are not fully discernible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors with a soft, diffused lighting. In the background, a whiteboard is present, but the text is not clear. On the right side, a man in a red sweatshirt is partially visible, though the letters on his shirt are not discernible. A character is prominently featured in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium close-up shot features a young man positioned slightly left of center in the foreground. To his right and slightly behind him in the middle ground, the back of another person wearing a red jersey occupies the right side of the frame. In the background on the left, a whiteboard is partially visible. The camera is positioned at the main subject's eye level.",
