    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a man in a white robe with gold trim, walking towards the camera from the background. He holds a blue book and is positioned centrally in the frame. As he approaches, his head moves out of the upper part of the frame, transitioning the shot to focus more on his torso and lower body. He then kneels in front of a wooden book stand located in the foreground, slightly off-center to the left. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, capturing his full body as he kneels. The man places the book on the stand and opens it, maintaining a central position in the frame. The large gold calligraphy panel is on the left side of the frame in the background, while the light-colored stone walls and tall windows are also in the background, providing natural lighting. The wooden book stand is in the foreground, with the man interacting with it directly. The camera captures the entire sequence without noticeable movement, keeping the subject and key elements consistently framed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man in a white robe with gold trim, wearing a white cap. He has a light skin tone and a short beard.  On the left side of the frame, there is a large gold and brown piece of calligraphy or text. Initially, the man walks toward the camera holding a blue book, which appears to be a religious text. As he approaches, his head moves out of the frame. He then kneels in front of a wooden book stand, fully reentering the frame, and places the book on the stand before opening it. The video ends with a full-body view of him in a kneeling posture, focused on the book.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting within a mosque, characterized by its serene and spacious environment. The walls are constructed from light-colored stone blocks, and a large, intricately designed gold calligraphy panel is prominently displayed. Natural light filters through tall windows, indicating that the scene occurs during the day and illuminating the space with a soft glow. The floor is lightly colored, and a wooden stand with detailed carvings initially stands empty. Later, a man places a book on the stand. The setting is calm and reflective, with a sense of quiet reverence.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The clip begins with a full shot of a man in a white robe walking toward the camera. As he gets closer, his head moves out of the frame. He then kneels, and the shot transitions back to a full-body view of him in a kneeling posture.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
