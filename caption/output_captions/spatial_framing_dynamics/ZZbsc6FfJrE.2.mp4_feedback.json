    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a crowded room, with a large red counter extending across the foreground. Positioned in the bottom center foreground on the counter are a clock figure and a candelabra. In the middle ground, a group of people is visible, including a man in a white shirt on the left, a woman with dark hair at the center-left, a young girl in the center, and a woman with blonde hair on the right. The background contains wooden shelves and other people. The camera, held at approximately eye level, pans from left to right while moving forward, transitioning into a medium shot. This motion shifts the clock and candelabra to the bottom-left foreground, while the girl and the blonde woman become more prominent in the center and center-right middle ground, respectively.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of people are gathered inside a room with wood-paneled walls and shelving. In the foreground, on a red counter, sits a brown, clock-like figure with a smiling face and a pendulum, next to a golden, three-armed candelabra with lit candles. The crowd includes a man in a white t-shirt with a black backpack, a woman with long dark hair in a white top, and a man in a neon green tank top. A young girl with a white headband looks over the counter, where stacks of white, round objects are displayed. To the right, a woman with blonde hair in a white tank top and sunglasses on her head is smiling. Other people are visible in the background, including a woman in a red and black plaid shirt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a scene inside a crowded, warmly lit shop during the day. The environment is defined by its reddish-brown wooden interior, featuring a large red counter in the foreground and tall, stocked shelving units in the background. On the counter, a brown clock-like figure with a face and a golden candelabra with three lit candles are positioned next to stacks of small, white, round plates. A framed portrait of a man in red clothing hangs on a distant wall. Various people are present throughout the space, with some standing near the counter and others browsing in the middle ground and background.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.",
