    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful supercell thunderstorm moving across a vast, flat plain. The sky is filled with a massive, swirling formation of dark grey and white storm clouds, with a lower, menacing shelf cloud from which curtains of heavy rain can be seen falling in the distance. Below, a wide expanse of green and yellow grassland stretches uninterrupted to the horizon, emphasizing the immense scale of the weather system. There is no main subject because the composition's focus is on capturing the raw power and atmospheric drama of the storm itself, dwarfing the landscape below.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene captures a vast, flat green field stretching to a distant horizon. The sky above is dominated by a massive, turbulent storm system. Dark grey and white clouds fill the upper atmosphere. Curtains of rain are visible falling from the base of the storm in the distance. The clouds show movement, suggesting a time-lapse of the weather event.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot with no main subject, presented as an extreme wide shot. The composition is divided horizontally, with the vast, turbulent storm clouds occupying the top two-thirds of the frame and a flat green field in the bottom third. The field extends from the immediate foreground to the distant background horizon. The main storm system is positioned in the middle ground, stretching across the width of the frame. Curtains of rain fall from the base of the clouds in the middle ground, primarily in the center and right portions of the scene. In this time-lapse view, the entire cloud formation moves from left to right. The lower, darker shelf cloud in the middle ground churns and rotates as it progresses, with a notable section on the right side moving towards the right. The camera is positioned at a low angle, level with the foreground plain.",
