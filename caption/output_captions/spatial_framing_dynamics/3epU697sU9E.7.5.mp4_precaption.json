    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged white man with short, graying brown hair is shown from the chest up, standing behind a wooden lectern. He wears a dark suit jacket, a light blue collared shirt, and a red tie. His expression is serious and concerned as he looks forward, appearing to address an audience. Text in the lower-left corner reads \"10:22 am Barksdale Air Force Base.\" An American flag is visible behind his right shoulder, and several framed portraits are on the wall behind his left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting at Barksdale Air Force Base, a man in a dark suit and red tie stands behind a wooden podium. The room has light gray walls, and behind the man, eight framed portraits are arranged in a grid. An American flag is positioned to his back. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays white text reading \"10:22 am\" and \"Barksdale Air Force Base.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, standing behind a lectern in the foreground. In the background, framed portraits are visible on the left, and an American flag is on the right. A text overlay is situated in the bottom-left foreground. The shot then slowly zooms in, transitioning to a medium close-up that focuses on the man's head and shoulders, which remain in the center of the frame. In this closer shot, the lectern is mostly cut off at the bottom of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the clip.",
