    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a vibrant rainbow arcing across a cloudy sky, with lush green trees and a street scene below. The focus is on the natural beauty and atmospheric conditions, emphasizing the rainbow's colors and the serene environment rather than any specific object. The presence of power lines and a distant mountain adds to the sense of scale and depth, enhancing the overall ambiance without highlighting a main subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an outdoor scene dominated by a bright double rainbow arching across a grey, overcast sky. Below the rainbow, lush green treetops are visible, along with several horizontal power lines stretching across the view. As the video progresses, the view pans slightly, revealing more of the ground level, including a paved road running alongside a white fence. Behind the fence and trees, buildings and a tall palm tree can be seen in the background. The overall lighting suggests daytime, likely following a rain shower.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of an outdoor scene. Initially, a bright primary rainbow arcs from the bottom left to the top right of the frame, with a fainter secondary rainbow visible above it against a grey sky in the background. The tops of green trees occupy the bottom foreground, and two horizontal power lines stretch across the middle ground. The camera then pans down and to the right. This movement reveals a paved road in the foreground, a white fence and more trees in the middle ground, and buildings in the background on the left. In the final composition, the rainbow's right end appears to touch down behind a tall palm tree located in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. The camera is positioned at a slightly elevated, eye-level perspective.",
