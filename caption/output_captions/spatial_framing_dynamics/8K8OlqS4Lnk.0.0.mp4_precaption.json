    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a vibrant rainbow arcing across a cloudy sky, with lush green trees and a street scene below. The focus is on the natural beauty and atmospheric conditions, emphasizing the rainbow's colors and the serene environment rather than any specific object. The presence of power lines and a distant mountain adds to the sense of scale and depth, enhancing the overall ambiance without highlighting a main subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an outdoor scene dominated by a bright double rainbow arching across a grey, overcast sky. Below the rainbow, lush green treetops are visible, along with several horizontal power lines stretching across the view. As the video progresses, the view pans slightly, revealing more of the ground level, including a paved road running alongside a white fence. Behind the fence and trees, buildings and a tall palm tree can be seen in the background. The overall lighting suggests daytime, likely following a rain shower.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot initially frames a double rainbow arcing across the upper two-thirds of the frame against a grey sky in the background. The brighter, primary rainbow is positioned lower than the fainter, secondary one. Two horizontal power lines stretch across the middle ground, bisecting the frame horizontally. Lush green treetops occupy the bottom third of the frame in the foreground and middle ground. The camera then pans slightly downwards and to the right. In the final framing, the rainbow shifts towards the upper left. The power lines remain in the middle ground but appear slightly higher in the frame. More of the ground level is revealed: a paved road runs along the bottom left foreground, bordered by a white fence in the middle ground. A tall palm tree becomes visible on the right side in the middle ground, alongside other trees and buildings in the background. A distant mountain is visible in the far background on the left. The camera starts looking slightly upwards and finishes at a more level perspective relative to the ground elements.",
