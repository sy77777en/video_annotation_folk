Initially, one individual with medium-length dark hair, dressed in a white shirt and tie, is seated in the center of the frame within a freestanding bathtub in the middle ground. This person then stands up, still holding a book, remaining in the same central position. Another individual with short hair, wearing a pink shower cap, lies in the bathtub, positioned slightly to the right in the middle ground. The bathtub occupies the central area of the frame, with its claw feet extending into the foreground. \n\nNatural light enters from a window located in the top center of the frame, with blinds and a curtain partially covering it, situated in the background. The window casts light patterns onto the walls. To the left side of the frame, in the background, there is a toilet with a roll of toilet paper beside it, and a hanging bathrobe is visible. A small shelf with toiletries is also on the left. On the right side, a radiator sits near the window in the background, with a blue towel hanging on a rack above a wooden bench in the foreground.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two individuals in a bathroom setting. One person, with medium-length dark hair, is wearing a white shirt and a tie and is initially sitting in a bathtub filled with bubbles, later standing up while holding a book. The other person, with short hair, is lying in the bathtub with their head resting on the edge, wearing a pink shower cap. A rubber duck is placed on the windowsill nearby. Natural light streams through a window with blinds, casting patterns on the wall.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set in a cozy, softly lit bathroom with a vintage aesthetic. The room features a freestanding bathtub with claw feet, filled with bubbles. A window with partially closed blinds and a partially drawn curtain allows sunlight to filter in, casting patterned shadows on the walls, suggesting the daytime. The walls are painted in a muted tone, complementing the warm wooden floor. A radiator is positioned next to the window, and a blue towel hangs on a nearby rack above a wooden bench with a green surface, where a pink towel is placed. The bathroom also includes a toilet, a roll of toilet paper, and a hanging bathrobe. A small shelf holds toiletries, and a pair of blue slippers is placed on the floor. The overall atmosphere is serene and intimate.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
