    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a kitchen scene focused on a wooden cutting board placed centrally on a light-colored countertop. The cutting board occupies the upper half of the frame, with sliced cucumbers spread across its surface in the middle ground. A knife with a white handle lies horizontally near the top edge of the board. In the foreground, various fresh vegetables, including green onions, lettuce, and tomatoes, are arranged along the bottom edge of the frame. These vegetables are positioned closer to the viewer, creating a layered effect with the cutting board and cucumbers behind them. The background includes a small section of white cabinetry, situated at the top of the frame. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the video; the camera remains stationary, capturing the scene from a slightly elevated angle, likely positioned just above the countertop level. The overall composition maintains a consistent focus on the arrangement of fresh produce and the cutting board.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a wooden cutting board with sliced cucumbers and a knife with a white handle. In the foreground, there are fresh vegetables including a bunch of green onions with white bulbs, leafy green lettuce, and two red tomatoes. The arrangement suggests a food preparation scene with a focus on fresh produce.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor kitchen setting with a wooden cutting board placed on a light-colored countertop. The board is covered with sliced cucumbers, showcasing their green, textured skin and pale interior. A knife with a white handle rests beside the cucumbers. In the foreground, fresh vegetables, including vibrant red tomatoes, crisp green lettuce, and a white bulb onion with green stalks, are arranged. A small section of white cabinetry is visible in the background. The environment is well-lit, highlighting the natural colors and textures of the produce, creating a clean and organized culinary workspace.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the scenery.",
