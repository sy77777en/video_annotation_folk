    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot. Initially, the focus is on the middle ground, where two open yellow flowers and two small flower buds are visible: one open flower with an attached bud on its stem is positioned slightly left of center, while a second open flower and a separate small, unopened bud are located slightly right of center. The foreground is blurred, and the background is a soft green field with out-of-focus yellow flowers. The focus then shifts from these middle ground elements to the foreground. After a brief blur during the transition, the shot becomes an extreme close-up, sharply focusing on a single yellow buttercup flower positioned in the foreground, slightly left of center. A smaller, closed green bud is visible on the same stem to the right of this open flower, also in the foreground. The background remains a soft, out-of-focus expanse of green and yellow. The camera is positioned at the subject's level for both focused subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a soft-focus, blurry view of numerous small, bright yellow flowers scattered across a vibrant green field, creating a bokeh effect. However, the camera initially focuses on the middle ground, where two bright yellow flowers and two small flower buds are clearly visible. The background remains a vibrant green field with scattered bright yellow flowers, enhancing the bokeh effect. The camera then shifts its focus from the middle ground to the foreground, with a brief moment of out-of-focus transition, before bringing a single yellow buttercup flower into sharp focus. This flower, with its five distinct yellow petals and a visible yellow center, is attached to a slender green stem. To the right of the open flower, on the same stem, a smaller, closed green bud is also in focus. The background remains a soft, out-of-focus expanse of green and yellow, suggesting a field of similar flowers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an outdoor scene in a sunlit field, where the initial view focuses on the middle ground, showcasing two small yellow flowers in relative clarity, while both the background and foreground remain blurred. The background is dotted with numerous small yellow flowers. The focus gradually shifts, bringing a single, delicate yellow buttercup with five distinct petals into sharp clarity in the foreground. This flower, along with a smaller, unopened bud, is supported by a slender green stem. The background remains a blurred tapestry of green foliage and other indistinct yellow blossoms, creating a shallow depth of field.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes an extreme close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
