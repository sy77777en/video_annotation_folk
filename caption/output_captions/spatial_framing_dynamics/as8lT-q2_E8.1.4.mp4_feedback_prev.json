    "pre_caption": "In a full shot viewed through three vertical panels, a woman is initially positioned in the center-left middle ground, standing on a layer of white material that covers the foreground. To her right, in the middle ground, is a decorative element wrapped in blue lights, while a pale-skinned figure and colorful neon lights are visible in the background. The camera, initially positioned below the woman, captures her as she is thrown backward and to the left. Her body rotates as she crashes through a glass pane in the middle ground, with her legs kicking up toward the top-left of the frame. As she falls, the camera's perspective shifts to be at her level, and she moves partially out of view, leaving only her legs visible in the top-left quadrant amidst flying glass and particles.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a brightly lit, chaotic scene, a woman with long, curly brown hair is thrown backward through a pane of shattering glass. She wears a light-colored outfit, dark boots, and has red stains on her hands. In the background, a mannequin or decorative object with very pale skin and short, slicked-back white hair is visible, wearing a reddish-orange top. To the right, a decorative element resembling a leg is present, wrapped in spiraling, glowing blue bands over an orange structure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a vibrant, futuristic environment, viewed through three vertical panels. The background is a blur of bright, colorful neon lights in shades of red, green, and blue, suggesting a bustling city at night. In the foreground, a layer of white, snow-like material covers the ground. The central action involves a transparent barrier shattering, sending shards of glass and a flurry of white particles into the air. A figure is seen falling forward through the breaking barrier, while glowing blue bands, part of the room's decor, are visible to the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
