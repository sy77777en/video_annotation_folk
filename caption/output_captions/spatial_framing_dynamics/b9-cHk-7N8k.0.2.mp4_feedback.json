    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured from the subject's level, a surfer is positioned in the center foreground, initially in a crouched stance on a surfboard that extends from the bottom of the frame. A large wave curls in the middle ground on the right, with the sun positioned at the top center and a coastline visible in the background on the far left. As the camera moves forward with the board, the scene pans to the right along the wave, causing the background coastline to shift further to the left of the frame. During this movement, the surfer transitions to a more upright stance while remaining in the center foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with reddish-brown, medium-length hair and a beard is shown surfing on a wave. He is wearing a black, short-sleeved wetsuit. Initially, he maintains a low, crouched stance on a light blue surfboard, with his right arm extended out to his side for balance and his left hand touching the water. Then, he stands up with his body facing left relative to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to the front of a light blue surfboard, captures a ride on a deep blue ocean wave. Under a bright sun in a clear blue sky with a few white clouds, the board glides across the water, creating white spray. To one side, the wave curls over, its face a dark turquoise. A person in a black wetsuit initially adopts a crouched position but then transitions to a more upright stance as they ride along the wave. In the background, a coastline with cliffs and vegetation is visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
