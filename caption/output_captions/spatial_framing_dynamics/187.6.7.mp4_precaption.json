    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a close-up of a woman with a dark skin tone against a very dark background. Her face is partially illuminated from the front left, leaving the right side mostly in shadow. She wears a patterned headscarf featuring blue, white, and possibly red designs, covering her hair. Underneath, she has on a beige turtleneck top and a dark jacket. A green and white patterned scarf is tied loosely around her neck. Her dark eyes appear wet, with visible tear streaks running down her cheeks. Initially, she looks off to her left, outside the frame, and only then shifts slightly to off-camera to her right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a close-up shot of a person in an extremely dark, indistinct setting, likely indoors at night or in a poorly lit room. The background is almost entirely black, with only a faint, out-of-focus element visible behind the subject's left shoulder. The person wears a patterned headscarf, primarily cream-colored with blue and possibly red designs, and a light-colored, possibly beige, turtleneck. The lighting is minimal and directional, originating from the front left side of the person, illuminating the left side of the person's face, while the right side remains mostly in shadow. White text subtitles are overlaid at the bottom of the screen, stating: \"If you have beautiful eyes, you'll see beautiful nightmares.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video commences with a medium close-up of a woman, who is centrally positioned in the foreground. Her face is the primary illuminated element, lit from the front left, while the background remains very dark and indistinct. As the shot progresses, the camera slowly zooms in, transitioning to a close-up that frames her face more tightly. Concurrently, her position shifts slightly to the right of the center in the foreground. During this transition, the woman, initially looking slightly off-camera to her left, subtly shifts her gaze towards the center and then slightly off-camera to her right. White text subtitles appear in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout.",
