    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up, shallow-focus shot centers on a translucent red thumbtack with a round head, which is pushed through a small white piece of paper into a light brown, marbled surface. A twisted red string is wrapped around the base of the thumbtack's head. The camera's focus then shifts, moving along the red string as it stretches across the surface, leading towards other out-of-focus thumbtacks and small pieces of paper. One of these pieces of paper is yellow and appears to have the text \"$2k for $10k\" written on it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A close-up, shallow-focus shot moves across a surface resembling a marbled tabletop or a corkboard. Several red, translucent thumbtacks are pushed into small pieces of white and yellow paper. A thin, twisted red string connects the thumbtacks, creating a network across the board. The camera's focus shifts, following the path of the red string from one pinned note to another, leaving the surrounding elements blurred.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a red thumbtack in the foreground, positioned in the bottom-left quadrant of the frame. A red string extends from the thumbtack toward the right, leading to out-of-focus papers and another thumbtack in the middle ground and background. The camera's focus then shifts, moving along the red string as it travels from the bottom left toward the center of the frame. The shot transitions to a close-up of the red string, now in the middle ground, as it lies across a yellow piece of paper in the bottom-center of the frame. The initial thumbtack is now a blurred element in the background on the left, with another out-of-focus thumbtack visible in the background on the right. The camera remains at a low angle, level with the surface, for the entire duration.",
