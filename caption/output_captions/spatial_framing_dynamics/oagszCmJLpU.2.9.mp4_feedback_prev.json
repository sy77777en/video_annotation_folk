    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a landscape, with the focus on the scenery rather than a specific subject. The composition is horizontally divided, with a vast, turbulent sky filling the upper two-thirds of the frame and a green field occupying the bottom third. A massive, dark storm cloud dominates the middle of the frame, stretching across its width. In the background, at the center of the horizon, a curtain of rain falls, illuminated by a patch of golden light. A few small buildings are visible in the distant background, slightly to the left of the center. The entire storm system, including the clouds and the central rain shaft, drifts slowly from left to right across the background. The camera remains static at a low height, looking across the foreground field toward the horizon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, capturing a powerful storm system moving across a vast, open plain. The sky is dominated by a massive, dark grey storm cloud that looms over the entire scene, with a concentrated downpour visible as a rain shaft in the distance, illuminated by a contrasting pocket of golden light. Below, a vibrant green field of wind-swept grass stretches to the horizon, where a few tiny buildings are dwarfed by the immense scale of the weather formation. There is no main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the environment itself, emphasizing the atmospheric tension and the sheer scale of the natural spectacle rather than any single object or figure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An expansive, flat green field stretches to the horizon under a turbulent sky. Massive, dark gray storm clouds fill the view, with a curtain of heavy rain falling in the distance. A sliver of the horizon beneath the storm is illuminated by a warm, golden light. The green grass or crops in the foreground sway and ripple in a strong wind as the storm system moves across the landscape. A few small buildings are faintly visible in the far distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
