    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a blue, porous-textured statue of a man in a military uniform, positioned centrally behind a table-like surface. The statue has a complex, lattice-like appearance and is rendered entirely in a vibrant blue. The man is depicted wearing a high-collared jacket with epaulets and has a distinct eyepatch over his left eye. He stands with a serious expression, his left hand resting on the surface in front of him. He is surrounded by other figures of a similar style and color. Two such figures are partially visible, one to his left and one to his right, while the out-of-focus shoulders of two others frame the shot from the foreground, suggesting a group gathering.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an abstract setting against a solid black background, a central figure rendered in a blue, porous, lattice-like style stands behind a brown, textured surface. This figure depicts a man in a military uniform with an eyepatch. Portions of four other similarly styled blue figures are visible: one to his left, one to his right, and the out-of-focus shoulders of two others in the foreground. The figures themselves are blue, and the perspective slowly moves backward, focusing on the central character. White subtitles are overlaid at the bottom of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a central blue statue of a man in a military uniform, positioned in the center of the middle ground behind a brown surface. To his left in the middle ground, another similar statue is partially visible. The out-of-focus shoulders of two other statues occupy the bottom left and bottom right of the foreground, framing the central figure. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and slowly pulls back, slightly widening the frame to reveal more of the figures and the space around them.",
