    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide, high-angle scenery shot with no main subject. Initially, the frame is almost completely dark, showing only a faint orange glow on the horizon in the bottom center and a field of stars in the top right. A sudden flash of lightning illuminates the scene, revealing a dark cliff silhouette in the foreground at the bottom left. In the middle ground, the vast canyon stretches across the frame, with a column of rain descending in the center and a steady orange light on the horizon to the right. A single lightning bolt strikes down into the canyon, just right of center. In the background, large storm clouds fill the upper half of the frame, while the starry sky remains in the top right. The scene then returns to darkness, with only the distant glow and stars visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm over a vast canyon at night. Under a partially starry sky, massive, dark storm clouds gather, periodically erupting in brilliant flashes of lightning that illuminate the deep, layered rock formations of the canyon below. A distinct column of rain is visible within the storm, and a single, sharp bolt of lightning strikes down, while a mysterious, steady orange glow persists on the distant horizon. The video lacks a main subject, as its purpose is to convey the immense scale and awe-inspiring power of the natural environment and the atmospheric drama of the storm itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, a vast canyon is plunged into darkness, with only a faint orange glow on the horizon. Suddenly, a powerful thunderstorm erupts over the canyon, dramatically illuminating the landscape. A large, dark storm cloud is lit from within by a brilliant white flash of sheet lightning, and a distinct bolt strikes down into the chasm. The foreground is defined by the dark silhouette of a cliff edge, and a small, steady orange light remains visible on the horizon to the right of the storm.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
