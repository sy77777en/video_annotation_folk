    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot focusing on a rural environment. It features an aerial view of a church with a tall, pointed spire, surrounded by a graveyard with neatly arranged headstones. The area is dotted with lush green trees and open grassy spaces, creating a serene and expansive atmosphere. The emphasis is on the overall environment and the peaceful rural setting, rather than a specific object, highlighting the scale and tranquility of the landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, filmed by a drone, captures an outdoor scene featuring a historic church with a tall, pointed spire, surrounded by a grassy landscape. The setting is a cemetery with neatly arranged headstones, visible paths, and clusters of mature trees providing shade. The church, constructed from stone, exhibits a traditional architectural style with a slate roof. The time of day is likely midday, as indicated by the bright, even lighting and clear skies. The drone's aerial perspective offers a comprehensive view of the church and its surroundings, highlighting the orderly layout of the cemetery and the natural greenery that frames the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a rural landscape, focusing on a church with a tall, pointed spire. The church is positioned in the center of the frame, extending from the middle ground to the background. Surrounding the church is a graveyard with neatly arranged headstones, primarily located in the top left and top center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. Lush green trees are scattered throughout, with a prominent cluster in the bottom right, providing a foreground element. Open grassy spaces fill the remaining areas, contributing to the expansive feel. The camera maintains a consistent aerial perspective, positioned above the scene, offering a comprehensive view of the church and its surroundings.",
