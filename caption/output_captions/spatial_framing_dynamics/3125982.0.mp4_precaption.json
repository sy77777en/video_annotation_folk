    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman engaged in a push-up exercise. She is wearing a dark sports bra and bright pink shorts, with fingerless gloves on her hands. Her skin tone is light, and her long hair is tied back. The focus is on her athletic posture, as she lowers and raises her body with her hands and feet supporting her movement. The scene emphasizes her physical activity and form.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a gym setting, with a focus on a person performing push-ups on a smooth, polished wooden floor. The lighting suggests daytime, with natural light streaming in and casting soft shadows across the floor, which has a warm, natural wood tone. The environment is spacious, and a large mirror is visible in the background, reflecting the dynamic atmosphere. The person is engaged in a workout, wearing athletic attire, including gloves and shorts, emphasizing activity and motion within the gym space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a woman performing push-ups. Initially, the camera focuses on her lower legs and feet, capturing her from the bottom left corner of the frame. As the sequence progresses, the camera pans upward, revealing more of her body in the center of the frame. Her hands, clad in fingerless gloves, are positioned in the foreground, while her torso and legs occupy the middle ground. The polished wooden floor serves as the background, extending across the entire frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera height, ensuring a steady view of the subject's movements. The transition from focusing on her lower legs to her full body occurs smoothly, keeping her central in the frame.",
