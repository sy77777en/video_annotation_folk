    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a small, yellow, bird-like creature with a notably atypical appearance: it has a large head with an orange beak, a round purple body, small yellow heart-shaped hands, and red feet, and is shown sitting. Another prominent subject is a bipedal, green alligator-like creature, rendered unusual by its attire consisting of a white nurse's cap with a red cross and brown pants secured by a dark brown belt. A third character is a small, grey raccoon-like creature, whose atypical feature is an orange shirt, complementing its black eye mask and striped tail.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds in a simple, cartoonish outdoor environment, characterized by a flat, green grassy field beneath a light blue sky dotted with large, pale yellow, cloud-like shapes. A few lighter green and yellow patches are visible on the grass, where two small, broken toy-like objects\u2014one with a brown base and yellow top, the other red with yellow legs\u2014are scattered. A small, yellow, bird-like character is initially seated on this field. The scene changes with the arrival of a white ambulance, marked with a red stripe and cross, which drives in from the left and stops, its back door open. Concurrently, a green, alligator-like character in a nurse's cap and a small, grey raccoon-like character run onto the field from the same direction.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot. A yellow bird-like creature is seated in the center middle ground, on a green grassy field that spans the lower half of the frame. In the foreground, one broken toy-like object is at the bottom left, and another is at the bottom right. The upper half shows a light blue sky with pale yellow cloud-like shapes in the background. The scene transitions to a wide shot as a white ambulance enters from the left, coming to a stop in the left middle ground with its back door open. Simultaneously, a green alligator-like creature runs in from the left, settling in the left-of-center middle ground, while a small, grey raccoon-like creature also enters from the left, positioning itself in the center middle ground. The yellow bird-like creature remains seated, now in the right-of-center middle ground. Throughout the video, the camera is positioned at the subjects' height.",
