    "pre_caption": "This is a static, extreme wide shot of a seascape at night, captured from a high-angle perspective. The bow of a container ship occupies the foreground across the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, the dark ocean stretches to the horizon, which is positioned just below the horizontal center of the frame. The background is dominated by the night sky, which fills the upper portion of the composition. Within this background, dark clouds drift across the frame in a time-lapse, periodically obscuring and then revealing a dense field of stars. A text overlay is positioned in the lower right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a seascape scenery shot captured from the bow of a large container ship navigating the open ocean at night. The sky above is a breathtaking celestial display, filled with a dense field of brilliant stars and the luminous band of the Milky Way, partially veiled by dark, drifting clouds. A faint, ethereal green and yellow glow, possibly airglow, lines the horizon where the dark sea meets the star-filled expanse. There is no main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale and serene atmosphere of the natural environment. The ship serves merely as a vantage point, its presence grounding the viewer and highlighting the vastness of the sea and sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high vantage point on the bow of a large ship, the scene looks out over a dark, calm ocean at night. Above, a vast, star-filled sky, featuring the dense band of the Milky Way, is partially obscured by dark clouds moving in a time-lapse. A faint greenish-yellow glow is visible on the horizon beneath the clouds. The foreground is occupied by the deck of the ship, which is loaded with stacked shipping containers. An overlay in the lower right corner displays the text \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK\" along with social media icons.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
