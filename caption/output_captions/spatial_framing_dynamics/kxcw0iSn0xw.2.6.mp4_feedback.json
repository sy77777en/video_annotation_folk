    "pre_caption": "In a close-up, top-down shot, a person's hands are initially positioned in the top-center of the frame, holding two spinning tops in the center of the middle ground. As the hands pull upwards and out of view, the tops spin in place, flinging paint outwards across the wooden surface that serves as the background. The tops eventually slow to a stop in the center of the frame, with the launchers they were attached to now visible in the bottom-center. A hand then re-enters from the top, resting in the middle ground just above the launchers.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person's light-skinned hands and arm, splattered with pink and blue paint, operate two spinning tops on a wooden surface. The top on the left has a red and pink finned section and is filled with red and yellow paint. The top on the right has a pink and blue finned section and is filled with pink and blue paint. Both tops are attached to blue and white launchers. As the tops spin, they fling the brightly colored paint outwards in thin, arcing lines and splatters.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective shows a light brown wooden surface with a visible grain. A pair of hands pulls ripcords on two spinning tops, one red and yellow and the other pink and blue, which are filled with paint. The rapid spinning flings the vibrant paint outwards in thin, arcing streams, creating a chaotic, web-like pattern of red, pink, yellow, and blue splatters across the wood. The tops eventually slow and stop, leaving the launchers and pools of mixed paint on the surface.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
