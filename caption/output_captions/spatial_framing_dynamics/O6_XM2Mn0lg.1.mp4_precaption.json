    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man dressed in dark, heavy clothing and armor, with a helmet that obscures his face and metallic elements on his arms, giving him a menacing and battle-ready appearance. He is positioned in a crouched stance, suggesting alertness or preparation for action. Near him, a sword with a long, straight blade and a crossguard is embedded upright in the ground, its hilt and blade reflecting light. The man\u2019s attire and the sword\u2019s placement create a striking visual contrast, emphasizing the sense of tension and readiness. Additionally, a bright, concentrated burst of blue-white light appears in the scene, casting a dramatic glow and highlighting the metallic surfaces of the man\u2019s armor and the sword.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors in a dense, dark forest at night, with tall, leafless trees silhouetted against a dim, bluish light that filters through the misty air. The ground is uneven and covered with patches of snow or frost, creating a cold, textured surface that reflects the limited light. A figure stands near the center, partially crouched, with a metallic object or weapon visible beside them, both appearing dark and matte with sharp, angular shapes. The atmosphere is heavy and still, with a faint glow or burst of blue-white light illuminating part of the scene, casting long shadows and creating a stark contrast between the illuminated and shadowed areas. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot showing a man in armor crouched near the center of the frame in the middle ground, with a sword embedded upright in the ground to his right (frame left, middle ground). The man\u2019s posture is low and alert, and both he and the sword are clearly visible against the snowy, uneven forest floor. The background consists of tall, leafless trees stretching vertically across the frame, filling the upper and side areas in the background. The camera is positioned at the same height as the man, maintaining a level perspective. As the scene progresses, the shot transitions to a wide shot, pulling back to reveal more of the forest environment and increasing the visible distance between the man, the sword, and the surrounding trees. A bright, concentrated burst of blue-white light appears in the left-center background, casting illumination across the scene and creating strong contrasts between lit and shadowed areas. Throughout, the man and sword remain in the middle ground, while the burst of light and trees occupy the background, and the camera maintains its height relative to the subjects.",
