    "pre_caption": "A medium close-up shot centers on a man and a woman slow-dancing in the middle ground. The camera initially frames the scene from behind the man, with the woman visible over his shoulder. As the couple sways and turns, the camera orbits with them, maintaining their central position while shifting the viewing angle to reveal their profiles and faces at different moments. In the background, out-of-focus red and green lights are positioned in the top right and top left of the frame. Above the couple in the top-center, glittery star ornaments hang in the middle ground, just behind them. Dark, vertically striped walls are occasionally visible in the background on the left. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man and a woman are slow-dancing in a close embrace. The man has voluminous, curly, light-blond hair and is wearing a light-colored suit jacket over a dark shirt and bow tie. The woman has long, straight, blond hair and is wearing a light-colored dress with sheer sleeves. A pink and white floral corsage is visible on her wrist. They hold each other tightly, with the woman often resting her head on the man's shoulder or chest as they sway together.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor space, a couple slow dances beneath hanging, glittery star-shaped ornaments. The scene is bathed in a soft, hazy glow from out-of-focus red and green lights, casting a warm tone over the setting. Dark, vertically striped walls are visible in the background as the couple sways together.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
