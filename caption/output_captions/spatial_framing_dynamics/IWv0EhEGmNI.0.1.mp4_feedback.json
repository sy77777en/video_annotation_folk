    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of a man's left hand gripping the steering wheel, positioned in the left and center of the frame and occupying the foreground, while the dashboard with illuminated gauges and a digital clock is visible in the middle ground on the right. The camera is at the same height as the hand, level with the steering wheel. The shot then transitions to a close-up of the driver\u2019s face, now centered in the frame and in the foreground, with the dashboard and windshield remaining in the middle ground and background. The camera pans left, maintaining a close-up shot as it shifts focus to a second man holding a rifle; he is positioned on the right side of the frame and in the foreground, with the metal partition and vehicle interior in the middle ground. The camera remains at the subject\u2019s eye level throughout, smoothly moving from the driver to the armed person, and the subtitle text appears at the bottom of the frame, overlaying the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up of a man's left hand gripping a steering wheel, showing a light skin tone and wearing a dark, long-sleeved jacket. The camera then transitions to reveal the driver's face, featuring a neatly trimmed beard and a dark hat. It pans left to focus on another man with slightly darker skin and very short hair, who is holding a large black rifle with both hands. He is wearing a dark tactical outfit and is positioned behind a metal barrier, looking intently through the weapon\u2019s sights. The camera moves smoothly from the driver to the armed person, highlighting their distinct roles and appearances.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place inside a vehicle at night, with the interior dimly lit by the dashboard\u2019s soft blue and red lights. The dashboard displays illuminated gauges and a digital clock reading 5:23, while the windshield reveals a dark, indistinct outdoor environment. The vehicle\u2019s interior features dark upholstery and a metal security partition with a grid pattern separating the front and back seats. A person in the back seat is visible holding a black rifle with a matte finish and textured grip, positioned near the partition. The scene includes an overlay of green and white subtitle text at the bottom, showing a conversation between two people. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by dark tones and subtle reflections from the dashboard lights.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
