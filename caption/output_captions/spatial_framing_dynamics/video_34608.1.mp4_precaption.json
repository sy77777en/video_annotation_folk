    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot featuring a vast mountain range shrouded in a thick blanket of white clouds. Lush green forests cover the slopes of the mountains in the foreground, which are partially obscured by rolling fog. In the distance, the dark, sharp peaks of taller mountains pierce through the sea of clouds under a pale, overcast sky. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is instead on capturing the serene and majestic atmosphere of the high-altitude environment, emphasizing the immense scale of the landscape and the ethereal quality of the clouds enveloping it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective of a mountainous landscape during the day under an overcast sky. A lush, green, tree-covered mountain ridge occupies the foreground, partially obscured by thick, white fog that fills the valleys. The fog moves slowly, creating a sea of clouds from which the dark, pointed peaks of distant mountains emerge. The drone advances over the foreground ridge, moving deeper into the cloudy expanse.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a mountainous landscape. Initially, a green, tree-covered mountain ridge occupies the bottom left foreground, partially obscured by fog. The middle ground is dominated by a sea of white clouds that fills the center and right of the frame. In the background, two dark mountain peaks are visible in the upper left and upper center, piercing through the clouds under an overcast sky at the top. The high-angle camera moves forward, flying over the foreground ridge and pushing deeper into the cloudy expanse. As a result, the foreground ridge moves out of the bottom of the frame, and the sea of clouds increasingly fills the view, with the background peaks remaining visible amidst the shifting fog.",
