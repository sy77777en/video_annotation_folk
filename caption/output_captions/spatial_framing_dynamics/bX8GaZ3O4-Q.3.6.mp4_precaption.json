    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an interior scenery shot of a dimly lit, opulent room at night. A strong beam of cool blue light emanates from a window on the left, illuminating a desk laden with a crystal decanter, a small golden box, and scattered papers. A tall, slender ornament is part of the base of an upright table lamp beside the window. The view outside the window reveals a dark sky with a series of bullet holes on the window. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is on establishing a mysterious and quiet atmosphere, using the environment and lighting to set a specific mood rather than highlighting a particular object or character.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is a dimly lit, opulent room at night, viewed from a low angle. A strong beam of cool, blue light shines from a window on the left, illuminating a large, dark desk. On the desk sits a glass decanter, a small gold-colored box, white papers that appear blue due to the lighting, and a tall, dark lamp with the blue light emanating from bullet holes in the window. Behind the desk, an ornate, gold-framed portrait painting hangs on the wall. The window on the left is framed by a pink curtain, and outside, the sky is dark. The foreground is dominated by the dark silhouette of a chair back, and the majority of the room remains in deep shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of an interior room, with the camera positioned at a low angle looking slightly up at the scene. The foreground is framed by the dark silhouettes of chairs on the bottom left and bottom right. A large desk occupies the middle ground, stretching horizontally across the frame. On the left side of the desk, a window serves as the primary light source, with a tall lamp positioned next to it. Various items, including a decanter, papers, and a small golden box, are arranged on the desk's surface in the middle ground. An ornate, gold-framed mirror is centered on the wall behind the desk, and another window is visible in the right middle ground. The background is composed of the dark night sky visible through the windows.",
