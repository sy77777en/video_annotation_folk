    "pre_caption": "A full shot, filmed at the subject's level, frames a man in a suit standing at a podium located in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground. In the foreground at the bottom-left, a woman extends a microphone toward him. A crowd of people is positioned in the middle ground, occupying the left and center of the frame. On the far right, an American flag stands in the middle ground, with a wall of framed portraits behind it in the background.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a photograph that slowly and subtly zooms in on a man in a dark suit standing at a wooden podium, appearing to address a group of people. He has short, gray hair and is facing the audience, suggesting he is the main subject. To his right, there are two flags, one of which is the American flag, and in the foreground on the right side of the frame, two more American flags are visible. In front of him, a woman with light hair, wearing a white shirt, is holding a microphone towards him, indicating a press event. Several other individuals, including photographers and journalists, are gathered around, some holding cameras and recording equipment. The setting appears to be a formal room with framed portraits on the walls, contributing to the official atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene takes place in a narrow room with blue-gray walls and light-colored, patterned carpeting. A man in a dark suit stands behind a wooden lectern, addressing a crowd of people holding cameras and microphones. In the foreground, a woman in a white shirt holds a handheld microphone toward the speaker. To the right, an American flag stands prominently next to a wall adorned with a series of framed portraits. Another dark flag is positioned behind the lectern. The lighting is brighter on the right side, while the left side has a dim green-blue tint.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
