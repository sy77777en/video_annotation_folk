    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle, forward-moving perspective. Initially, a dirt path occupies the center of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. It is flanked by blurred green trees on the left and right, creating a tunnel-like composition with a patch of bright sky visible in the top-center background. The camera then moves rapidly forward and tilts upward, causing the scene to open up. The path shifts to the lower portion of the frame, while a flat green field fills the left and a sloping green hill occupies the right. In the middle ground and background, several houses appear on the top-right of the frame, situated on the hill. The sky, containing the sun and clouds, expands to fill the top and top-right portions of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a rapid journey along a dirt road through a narrow passage, bordered by trees on both sides, creating a significant motion blur effect. As the camera progresses, the view opens up to reveal flat green fields on either side, enhancing the sense of speed and immersion. The bright blue sky, dotted with a few white clouds and a brilliant sun, adds to the vibrant rural scenery. In the distance, several houses are visible on a gentle slope, surrounded by trees, further enriching the landscape. The fast-paced perspective emphasizes the atmosphere and dynamic movement through the countryside, rather than focusing on any particular object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a high-speed flight along a dirt path in a rural, countryside setting. The journey begins with the camera following a dirt road through a narrow passage flanked by trees on both sides. As the drone progresses, the view expands to reveal a flat green meadow on either side. The path is surrounded by vibrant green grass and leafy trees on a bright, sunny day. The sky is blue with a few scattered white clouds. As the drone speeds forward and tilts, the scenery blurs significantly, creating streaks of green and brown. In the background, several houses are visible on a gentle slope, surrounded by trees.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
