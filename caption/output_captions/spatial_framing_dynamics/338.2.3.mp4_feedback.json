    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a woman seated at a dining table. The subject occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground. Her upper body, from the waist up, is visible. To her left (viewer's right), part of another person's arm is seen, indicating they are also seated at the table. A glass of amber-colored liquid is placed in the bottom left corner of the frame, while a small bowl is situated near the bottom right. The table, covered with a white cloth, spans across the lower portion of the frame, with plates of food positioned centrally. The background, featuring dimly lit tables and dark wooden elements, is located behind the subject, contributing to the depth of the scene. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with medium-length dark hair and a medium skin tone, wearing a maroon vest over a dark-colored top with intricate gold embroidery. She is seated at a table, holding chopsticks and eating from a plate of food. Her expression is attentive and engaged as she looks slightly to the side. In front of her, there is a glass of amber-colored liquid and a small bowl, suggesting a dining setting. The scene conveys a moment of dining and conversation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a dimly lit restaurant with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The setting features a round table covered with a white tablecloth, adorned with plates of colorful food and a glass of amber-colored drink. The restaurant's interior includes dark wooden elements and soft lighting, creating a cozy ambiance. The ceiling has a decorative design, adding to the traditional aesthetic. The scene captures a moment of dining, with subjects seated around the table, engaged in conversation. The overall environment suggests a relaxed and intimate dining experience.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
