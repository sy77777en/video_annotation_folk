    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a woman in mid-air performing a somersault against a dark blue background with the white Olympic rings logo. She is wearing a blue one-piece swimsuit with lighter side panels and crisscross back straps, and her hair is braided. As she jumps into the water, the camera captures her in motion, although at both the beginning and end of the video, only a small portion of her body is visible in the middle bottom and right bottom of the frame, respectively.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a female athlete performing a one-and-a-half backward somersault dive into a pool. Filmed from above the water, the focus is on her mid-air dive, with the Olympic rings logo visible against a dark blue background wall. The athlete is primarily centered and on the right side of the frame as she executes her dive.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a full shot of a woman jumping into the air and performing two midair rotations, as if preparing to dive into the water. The background includes an Olympic sign, indicating the scene takes place indoors. The camera remains at a fixed angle, with the woman's full body visible only during the middle portion of the video.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a low-angle shot, showing the lower body of a woman from the waist down, positioned in the bottom center of the frame and occupying the middle ground. As she performs rotations, she moves upwards, transitioning the view into a full shot where her entire body is visible near the center, slightly towards the right side of the frame. The white Olympic rings logo serves as the background element, consistently positioned in the top center. The woman then descends towards the bottom right, and the framing returns to showing only a partial view of her body before she exits the frame. The camera maintains a fixed position below the subject throughout the action.",
