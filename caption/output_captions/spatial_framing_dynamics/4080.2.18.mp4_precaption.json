    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black woman with black dreadlocks, a septum piercing, and light-colored eyebrows is shown in profile. She wears a long-sleeved, olive-green top with embroidery, ripped blue jeans, and multiple bracelets, rings, and a necklace. One of her rings is green. She is sitting and appears to be styling the hair of a person in the foreground, who is facing the camera. This second person has dark, voluminous, curly hair. The woman holds a lock of their hair in her hands.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a softly lit outdoor setting with a blurry, natural background, a woman with green-tipped dreadlocks is seated. She wears a green, long-sleeved top, ripped blue jeans, several bracelets, and multiple rings, including one that is green. Her attention is directed toward a lock of hair from the person in the foreground, which she is holding in her hands. The dark, curly hair of this person is visible in the right foreground, partially obscuring the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman is positioned in the left and center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. In the right foreground, the dark, curly hair of a second person partially obscures the view. The woman in the middle ground holds a lock of hair from the person in the foreground. A blurry, natural setting is visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, and the spatial framing remains static.",
