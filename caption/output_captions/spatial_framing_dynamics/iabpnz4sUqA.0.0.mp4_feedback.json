    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a scenic landscape, capturing a vast expanse of nature and human-made structures. Initially, the rainbow dominates the upper part of the frame, spanning from the left to the right side, positioned prominently in the background. The trees, primarily evergreen and some with autumnal hues, occupy the middle ground, extending from the bottom left towards the center. Houses with sloped roofs appear in the foreground on the left side. As the video progresses, the camera gradually shifts its focus, revealing more of the open landscape. The highway with moving cars and distant buildings enter the frame from the right, appearing in the middle ground. The rainbow remains consistently visible throughout, maintaining its position in the background. The camera maintains a high vantage point, providing an aerial perspective that captures the entirety of the scene, from the residential area in the foreground to the open fields and distant structures in the background. The camera's height relative to the subject suggests it is positioned well above the ground, offering a broad overview of the landscape. There are no significant changes in shot size; the framing remains an extreme wide shot throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a focus on the natural landscape, highlighting a rainbow and the expansive view of trees and fields, creating a sense of vastness and tranquility. In the latter portion, a highway with moving cars and several distant buildings come into view, adding a dynamic element to the serene scenery.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases an outdoor setting transitioning from a residential area to a more open landscape. It is set during the day, with a prominent rainbow arching across the sky, adding vibrant colors to the scene. The environment features a mix of dense evergreen and deciduous trees, with some displaying autumnal hues of red and orange. In the residential area, houses with sloped roofs are visible, nestled among the trees. As the scene transitions, the landscape opens up to reveal fields and a distant view of a road with vehicles, indicating a rural or suburban area. The sky is overcast, suggesting recent or impending rain, which enhances the visibility of the rainbow. The overall atmosphere is serene, with natural elements like trees and fields dominating the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
