    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A very large, oblong, yellow pumpkin with prominent vertical ribs rests on a wooden surface. The pumpkin is still attached to a thick, green vine that extends from its stem and curves behind it to the left. To the right of the pumpkin sits a dark green baseball cap, which has a circular logo on the front featuring an orange image and white text.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A massive, oblong, yellow pumpkin with prominent vertical ribs rests on a rough wooden table inside what appears to be a tent or temporary structure with white fabric walls. A thick, dark green vine is still attached to the pumpkin and extends out of view. For scale, a dark green baseball cap with a logo is placed on the table next to the large gourd. A thin wooden stick leans against the back wall.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned slightly higher than the pumpkin.",
    "pre_caption": "A full shot displays a large, yellow pumpkin positioned in the center-left of the frame, occupying the middle ground. A green vine, attached to the pumpkin, extends from the center towards the top left before curving down and exiting the frame on the left. To the right of the pumpkin, a green baseball cap rests in the bottom-right middle ground. Both objects sit on a wooden surface that fills the bottom portion of the frame. The background consists of white fabric walls, with a thin wooden stick leaning against the wall in the background, slightly right of center. The camera is stationary and positioned slightly higher than the pumpkin.",
