    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, two white swans are positioned in the middle ground on an icy bank. The swan on the left stands left of center, while the swan on the right, which flaps its wings, is positioned right of center. The snowy bank and background occupy the top half of the frame, with a body of water in the bottom half. Blurred branches frame the scene from the foreground on the bottom and right. The camera remains static and is positioned above the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two white swans are positioned on the edge of an icy, snow-covered bank next to a body of water. The swan on the left initially stands in profile with its long neck curved back, tucking its head into its feathers, and then eventually stretches out its neck. The swan on the right is facing the camera and flaps its large white wings, holding them outstretched. The swan on the right is reflected in the dark water in front of it, while the swan on the left is reflected in the dark water behind it. Both swans have dark beaks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stark winter landscape, two white swans stand at the edge of a body of dark, rippling water. The bank is covered in white snow and a layer of ice where it meets the water. One swan stands still with its head tucked back, while the other faces the viewer and spreads its large white wings. Their faint reflections are visible on the water's surface. The background is a uniform expanse of white snow under an overcast sky, with blurred brown branches framing the scene in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
