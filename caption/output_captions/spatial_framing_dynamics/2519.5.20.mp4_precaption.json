    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two people engaged in an activity. The person on the left, wearing a dark green sweater with a textured pattern, is seated and focused on handling a small object, possibly a bandage, with both hands. Their hands are prominent, showing a watch on the left wrist and a ring on the left hand. The person on the right, wearing a white shirt with blue horizontal stripes, is also seated and appears to be observing or assisting. A small, open container with additional items is visible, suggesting a shared task or interaction between the two.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, intimate atmosphere. The environment is softly lit, suggesting a cozy room. The focus is on two individuals engaged in a quiet, personal interaction. The person facing the camera is wearing a textured, dark green sweater, while the individual on the right side of the frame is in a striped shirt. They are handling a small, transparent container with bandages, indicating a moment of care or attention. The person in the sweater is holding the bandages and peeling off the backing of one. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, providing a detached, observational perspective on the interaction. The overall tone is calm and focused, with the lighting and setting enhancing the sense of a private, thoughtful moment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on the upper bodies and hands of two individuals. The person on the left, wearing a dark green sweater, occupies the left side of the frame, with their hands prominently displayed in the foreground as they manipulate a small object. This individual's left wrist, adorned with a watch, and left hand, featuring a ring, are clearly visible. The person on the right, dressed in a white shirt with blue stripes, is positioned slightly to the right and further back in the frame, with their hands also in the foreground but less active. An open container with additional items lies in the bottom left corner of the frame, near the person in the green sweater. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective that emphasizes the interaction between the two individuals and the objects they handle. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the sequence.",
