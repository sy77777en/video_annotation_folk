    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A stop-motion puppet of a young girl with tan-colored skin and dark brown hair styled in two braids is shown wearing a white collared shirt under a dark jumper. Her appearance is atypical, characterized by a proportionally large head and dark eyes that make it difficult to discern her pupils. She interacts with a worn, brown burlap satchel featuring two silver-colored metal clasps. The hands and head of a second puppet with short, dark hair are briefly seen as they pat and then kiss the top of the girl's head.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors within a dimly lit room with warm, ambient lighting. A worn, brown satchel made of a coarse, burlap-like fabric with two silver-colored metal clasps rests on a rough, textured mat on the floor. A small stack of colorful cards is placed beside the bag. The background is dark and out of focus, suggesting a cluttered space. A stop-motion figure of a girl with dark braided hair places an item into the open satchel.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a close-up on a brown burlap satchel in the center foreground, with a pair of hands placing an item inside it. A small stack of cards is visible in the bottom left foreground. The camera then tilts up, reframing the scene into a medium shot that centers on a girl's head and shoulders. A second figure's hand enters the frame from the top right to pat her head, followed by the figure's head, which enters from the top of the frame to kiss her forehead before both exit. The shot concludes with the girl remaining in the center of the frame, looking upward. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
