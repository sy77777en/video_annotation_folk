    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a landscape scenery shot of a wide, fast-flowing river with dark blue water and white rapids. The river is bordered by expansive, grey, pebbly banks. In the background, a line of lush green trees and vegetation gives way to rolling green hills and distant mountains, all set against a bright blue sky filled with large, fluffy white clouds. There is no main subject in this video, as the composition is intended to capture the scale and atmosphere of the natural environment, focusing on the interplay between the powerful river and the serene mountain landscape rather than a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A wide, fast-flowing river with dark blue water and white ripples runs through a valley on a clear day. The river is bordered by broad, gray, rocky shores covered in stones and pebbles. In the background, rolling hills covered in dense green trees line the horizon under a bright blue sky with scattered, white cumulus clouds. One of the hills on the right has a large, exposed section of light-colored earth. More distant, hazy mountains are visible behind the hills.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a river landscape. A wide, fast-flowing river occupies the bottom half of the frame, running from the middle ground toward the foreground. It is flanked by expansive, pebbly banks in the foreground and middle ground on both the left and right sides. A line of green trees extends across the middle ground, situated behind the riverbanks. In the background, rolling green hills are visible, with more distant mountains behind them. The top half of the frame is filled with a blue sky and white clouds. The camera is positioned at a slightly elevated height, capturing the scene from a fixed, straight-on perspective.",
