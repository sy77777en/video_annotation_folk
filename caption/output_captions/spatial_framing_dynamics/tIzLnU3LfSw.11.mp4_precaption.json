    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of five male ice hockey players celebrates on an ice rink. They wear matching uniforms consisting of dark blue helmets with visors, jerseys that are white at the top of the shoulders and dark blue on the sides, with white across the chest. Their red pants extend from the waist to the top of the knee, and they wear long socks on their shins that match the color scheme of red, white, and blue. The gloves are a combination of red, white, and blue. White numbers, including 27, 9, 4, 25, and 28, are visible on their sleeves and backs. The players, holding hockey sticks, initially gather near the boards, patting each other on the back and head, before skating away together. In the background, behind a glass barrier, several spectators watch the game. Among them is a woman with blonde hair wearing a white vest and a man in a grey sweatshirt with the word \"PENGUINS\" on the front.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor ice hockey rink features a group of players skating on a white ice surface. The rink is enclosed by white boards marked with blue and red lines and various advertisements, including a \"mccann\" logo in white text on a blue background and a large \"Jeep\" logo next to a graphic of a red vehicle. In the background, spectators watch the scene from tiered seating behind a clear glass barrier. The players, wearing dark blue, white, and red uniforms with matching helmets, celebrate together near the boards before skating away as a group towards the center of the rink, passing in front of a red-framed goal net.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot begins with five hockey players celebrating in a group in the middle ground, positioned on the left side of the frame near the rink boards. In the background, spectators are visible behind a glass barrier. The players then break from their huddle and skate in a loose formation towards the right, moving across the middle ground. As they skate, the camera pans slightly to follow their movement, keeping them relatively centered. They pass a red-framed goal net on the left and continue across the ice. The rink boards and advertisements occupy the foreground and lower portion of the frame, while the spectators remain in the background throughout the shot. The camera is positioned above the subjects.",
