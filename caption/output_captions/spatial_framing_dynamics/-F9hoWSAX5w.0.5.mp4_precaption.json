    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the urban setting and architectural details rather than a specific object. The emphasis is on the overall mood and texture of the cityscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor urban setting featuring a dilapidated multi-story building with a cylindrical corner tower. The structure is partially covered in tattered construction wrap and has visible fire escape stairs. The sky is overcast, casting a muted, greenish hue over the scene, suggesting a cloudy day. The building's facade shows signs of wear, with peeling materials. The environment appears still, with no visible movement or activity.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban cityscape, focusing on a multi-story building with a cylindrical corner tower. The building occupies most of the frame, extending from the left side towards the right, with its full height visible. The cylindrical tower is positioned in the foreground on the left, while the main body of the building stretches into the middle ground towards the right. The tattered construction wrap and fire escape stairs are prominently displayed across the facade, with the wrap covering parts of the building in the middle and right sections. The sky forms the background, appearing overcast and casting a muted, greenish hue over the scene. The camera remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective from a low angle, looking up at the building. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning, keeping the building as the central focus. The camera's height is below the building, emphasizing its verticality and architectural details.",
