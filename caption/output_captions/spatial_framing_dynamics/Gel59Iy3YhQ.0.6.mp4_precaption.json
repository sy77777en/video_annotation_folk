    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features two humanoid figures rendered as simple, solid-colored, pixelated silhouettes. The first figure is entirely yellow and holds a thin, white line representing a sword. The second figure, which appears later, is identical in its blocky, featureless form but is solid orange and also holds a white sword. Other objects in the scene share this minimalist, pixelated aesthetic, including candelabras with three flickering yellow flames. Initially, a large, yellow arrow with the word \"GO\" positioned above it points to the right. Eventually, the yellow arrow disappears, and an orange arrow of the same style appears on the left side of the frame, pointing to the left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile, the setting is a pixel-art environment with a light gray brick floor and a solid black background. On the left, a large, light-brown pillar stands, with yellow pixels resembling drips on the floor beneath it. In the background, two red, arched shapes are visible. As the scene scrolls to the right, a gray brick wall reveals a darker brown interior section with two lit torches on the wall, two barrels, and two candelabras on the floor. An overlay in the upper right corner features a large, yellow arrow pointing right, with the word \"GO\" in yellow letters positioned above it.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a side-view perspective, level with the characters. Initially, a yellow figure with a sword is positioned in the bottom left middle ground, standing next to a large pillar that occupies the left foreground. In the background, two red arched shapes are visible in the upper center, while a large yellow \"GO\" arrow is fixed in the top right foreground as an overlay. The yellow figure runs to the right as the scene scrolls in the same direction, revealing a gray brick wall that opens into a brown interior section. An orange figure and two candelabras appear from the right side of the frame. The yellow and orange figures meet and fight in the center middle ground before the orange figure is defeated. The yellow figure then continues moving to the right, passing the candelabras.",
