    "pre_caption": "The scene is captured in a static, high-angle full shot, showing a person standing in the foreground, slightly left of center, on a low circular platform. In the background, positioned at the top of the frame, the lower halves of other figures are visible near equipment on a higher, more distant platform, establishing depth in the all-white space. Following a bright white flash that momentarily whites out the entire frame, the shot returns to its original composition, revealing that the person in the foreground has disappeared. The hose-like object they were holding now rests on the foreground platform, while the figures in the background remain in their static positions at the top of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, viewed from their side and rear, stands wearing a white, full-body suit with a hood covering their head. The suit features a thin, vertical orange stripe running down the side of their arm and leg. This person holds a white, curved, hose-like apparatus. In the background, the lower halves of several other people are visible; they are also dressed in white, lab-style clothing and are positioned near white equipment. Following a bright white flash, the main person in the foreground disappears, leaving the hose-like object behind, while the people in the background remain in view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a stark, all-white room featuring a polished floor and matching walls. The minimalist environment includes raised circular and rectangular platforms, with various pieces of white, wheeled equipment visible in the background. Figures dressed in white jumpsuits and hoods occupy the space. A brief, intense white flash interrupts the scene, after which a figure who was standing in the foreground is no longer present, leaving a white, hose-like apparatus resting on a circular platform.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera films a full shot of a person from their side-rear in a lab-like setting, with the lower halves of distant people visible at the top; a flash occurs and the main subject disappears, while the top people remain in view.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
