    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A convoy of highly detailed 3D-rendered vehicles travels in a single file line down a paved road. At the center of the formation is a large semi-trailer truck with a dark-colored cab and a long, white, rectangular, windowless trailer. Escorting this truck are five dark green, boxy, armored tactical vehicles, three positioned in front of the truck and two behind. These armored vehicles have an angular design and what appears to be a turret or mount on the roof. A black and white police-style SUV leads the convoy, and another similar police vehicle brings up the rear.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a convoy of vehicles traveling along a paved, four-lane highway, with two lanes designated for each direction of travel, cutting through a vast, arid desert. The surrounding environment is characterized by sandy, light-brown terrain, sparse green scrub, and distant rocky hills under a bright, clear sky. The convoy, moving in a single file line, consists of a large, white rectangular container on a truck, escorted by several dark, blocky armored vehicles and two black-and-white cars, which appear to be police vehicles. The daytime sun casts long, distinct shadows from the vehicles onto the asphalt as they proceed through the landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot captured from a high angle, a convoy of vehicles travels diagonally across the frame from the top left toward the bottom right. The entire formation is situated in the middle ground, moving along a paved road that cuts through an arid desert landscape. A police-style SUV leads the convoy at the top left, followed by three armored vehicles, a central semi-truck with a white trailer, two more armored vehicles, and a final police SUV bringing up the rear toward the bottom right. The desert terrain fills the foreground and middle ground, while distant hills line the background at the top of the frame. The camera tracks alongside the convoy, maintaining a consistent position relative to the vehicles as they move forward.",
