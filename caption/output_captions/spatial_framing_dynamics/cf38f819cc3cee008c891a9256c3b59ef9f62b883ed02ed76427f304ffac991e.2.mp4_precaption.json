    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with brown hair tied back is in a sandy enclosure with a white horse. The woman wears a blue button-up shirt, dark pants, and dark boots, and she holds a lead rope. The rope is attached to the reddish-brown halter worn by the horse. The horse is white with some grey flecks on its coat and is walking in a circle around the woman.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor, sandy round pen on a sunny day, a woman pivots her body to follow a white horse walking in a circle around her. The enclosure is constructed from horizontal metal pipes, with a taller, solid, light-colored wall visible behind it. The ground is covered in light brown sand. In the background, residential houses with pitched roofs, green trees, and power lines are visible against a clear sky. The white horse, wearing a reddish-brown halter, moves around the woman, kicking up dust from the sandy ground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot frames a woman on the left and a white horse on the right, both positioned in the middle ground of a sandy enclosure. In the background, a solid wall, houses, and trees are visible. The woman, holding a lead rope, pivots in the left-center of the frame as the horse walks in a counter-clockwise circle around her. The horse's movement takes it from the right side of the frame into the background, then across to the left behind the woman, and finally back towards the foreground, completing its circular path. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the subjects' level.",
