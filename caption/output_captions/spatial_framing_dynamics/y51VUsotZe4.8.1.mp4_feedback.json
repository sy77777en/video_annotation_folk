    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a cityscape at night, capturing a vast expanse of the urban environment. The camera is positioned high above the scene, providing a bird's-eye view of the city. The grid-like arrangement of streets occupies the center of the frame, extending towards all edges. Buildings are scattered throughout the scene, with some located in the foreground and others receding into the background. The illuminated windows and streetlights create a pattern of light across the entire frame, with brighter areas concentrated in the middle ground and dimmer regions toward the periphery. Vehicles move along the streets, their headlights forming streaks of light that traverse the scene horizontally and vertically. The camera remains stationary, maintaining a consistent perspective throughout the sequence, emphasizing the scale and complexity of the urban layout. The overall spatial composition highlights the interplay between the illuminated streets and the dark night sky, underscoring the city's structured design and dynamic activity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures an aerial view of an urban environment at night, focusing on the intricate network of streets and the illuminated patterns created by streetlights and buildings. The emphasis is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the city rather than any specific object. The grid-like arrangement of roads, the glowing windows, and the movement of vehicles contribute to a dynamic and expansive portrayal of the city, highlighting its vibrant and bustling nature.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases an aerial view of a bustling urban environment at night. The setting is outdoors, featuring a grid of city streets illuminated by streetlights and the glow of vehicle headlights. Tall buildings with varying architectural designs line the streets, their windows emitting a warm, ambient light. The roads are busy with moving traffic, creating a dynamic pattern of light trails. The scene is characterized by a mix of straight and intersecting roads, with visible intersections and crosswalks. The overall atmosphere is vibrant, with the cityscape's lights contrasting against the dark night sky, highlighting the structured layout and lively activity of the urban setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
