    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video displays a stylized map of a coastal area, set against a black background. The map features a grid of thin white lines representing roads, with topographical lines indicating mountains on the right side and a coastline on the left. A glowing red line traces a route from the upper left, moving southeast, terminating in a moving red dot that follows a white dashed line towards the southwest. The red line likely signifies the path already traveled, while the dotted white line indicates the planned route. As the video progresses, the topographical lines representing mountains on the right side gradually disappear, leaving a featureless black area. The path leads to a red location pin labeled \"ASCENSION CEMETERY\" in white, uppercase text.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A stylized, dark map displays a coastal region with a grid of white lines representing roads against a black background. A prominent, glowing red line traces a route along a highway near the coast. From this red path, a white dashed line extends along the coast, leading to a red pin. An overlay of white, capitalized text next to the pin identifies the location as \"ASCENSION CEMETERY.\" The land is depicted in dark gray, with mountainous terrain visible further inland, while the adjacent body of water is a slightly lighter gray.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a top-down view of a stylized map that fills the entire frame. A glowing red line, positioned in the foreground, originates in the top left and extends towards the center. From the end of this red line, a white dashed line, also in the foreground, traces a path toward the bottom right, leading to a red pin labeled \"ASCENSION CEMETERY\" in the middle ground. The map's middle ground is composed of a white grid representing roads, while the background features topographical lines on the right and a coastline on the left. As the shot progresses, the end of the red line animates along the white dashed path, and the topographical lines on the right side of the frame gradually fade to black. The camera remains in a fixed, overhead position throughout the scene.",
