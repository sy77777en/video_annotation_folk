    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures a lone skier positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. From a high-angle perspective, the camera follows the skier as they descend the slope, moving from the middle ground toward the foreground while remaining centered. Trees line the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the middle ground into the background, where snow-covered mountains are visible across the top of the scene. A large shadow from an unseen structure occupies the bottom right foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person is seen skiing down a wide, snow-covered slope, facing the camera. The skier wears a bright orange jacket over dark pants, along with a dark-colored helmet and goggles. They are holding a ski pole in each hand and are on two dark skis, descending the mountain.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone follows a lone skier down a wide, groomed ski slope on a sunny day. The vast expanse of white snow is marked with tracks, and the skier, wearing an orange jacket, is positioned in the center, descending the mountain. Dense lines of evergreen and bare trees border both sides of the slope. In the distance, snow-covered mountain peaks rise against a bright blue sky dotted with a few white clouds. A distinct shadow cast by a ski lift tower appears on the snow in the lower right portion of the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
