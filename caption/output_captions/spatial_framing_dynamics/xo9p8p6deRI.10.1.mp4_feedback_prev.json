    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of the scene, capturing all three cars and parts of the surrounding environment. The main subject, a boxy SUV, is positioned in the foreground and center of the frame, closer to the house with a porch. This SUV occupies a significant portion of the frame, emphasizing its prominence. Behind it, in the middle ground and slightly to the left, is another sedan, also centered but further back. The third car is located in the background on the left side, parked perpendicular to the others on the street. The house with steps and a window is situated in the upper right quadrant of the frame, in the background. Trees are scattered around the scene, with one near the left edge and another near the center-right, both in the background. Shadows from the trees fall across the ground, adding depth. The camera maintains a consistent overhead angle, positioned above the subjects, providing a clear view of the entire arrangement. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the frames. Subtitles appear at the bottom center of the frame, indicating dialogue or narration.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a monochromatic scene with three cars as the main subjects. The foremost car, a boxy SUV with a distinct front grille and visible side mirrors, is parked closest to a house with a porch, serving as the main focus of the scene. Behind it, a sedan with a similar boxy design is parked, but the first car has a slightly different style. The third car is parked perpendicular to the other two, positioned on the street rather than in the driveway. Both the second and third cars have objects on their roofs, suggesting they might be police vehicles. The setting includes a house with visible steps and a window, and trees are present, casting shadows on the ground. The arrangement suggests a driveway or parking area, with the cars aligned in a row leading towards the house, except for the third car on the street.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor suburban setting during the day, characterized by a monochromatic color scheme. The scene features a driveway leading to a house with a porch and steps. Two vehicles, a larger SUV and a smaller car, are parked on the driveway. The vehicles and the house are rendered in a uniform, light gray color, lacking detailed textures. Trees with simple foliage are present, casting soft shadows on the ground. The environment is calm, with no visible weather effects. Overlay elements include subtitles at the bottom center of the scene, displaying \"[...]\" in yellow text, along with the additional text \"Don't do it O.J.!\" which serves as a caption.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
