    "pre_caption": "In a static close-up shot, a hand holding a silver utility knife occupies the top right foreground, with its blade pressed against the top edge of a smartphone. The smartphone itself fills the center, bottom, and left portions of the frame in the middle ground. A second hand is partially visible at the top left and bottom right, securing the phone. In the top background, a white object is visible behind the hand and phone. The camera is positioned directly above the subjects, providing a high-angle view of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person's light-skinned right hand holds a silver-colored metal utility knife with its sharp, trapezoidal blade extended, hovering above the black top bezel of a dark-colored foldable smartphone, right at the edge of the screen. The phone's large display has a blueish tint with two parallel lines separating different shades of blue. A small circular feature, which appears to be an air bubble, is visible near where the knife is hovering. The left hand holds the smartphone, while the right hand holds the knife.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot shows a hand holding a silver utility knife, pressing the blade against the top edge of a dark-colored foldable smartphone. The phone's screen is reflective with a blue tint, and a small, circular, dotted pattern is visible near the top bezel. The scene takes place on a plain white surface, with the text \"JerryRigE\" appearing as part of an object in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
