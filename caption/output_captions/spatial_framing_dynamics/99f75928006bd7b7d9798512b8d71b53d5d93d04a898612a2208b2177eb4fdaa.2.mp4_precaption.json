    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two women interacting. The woman positioned more to the left has long, dark, straight hair and wears a white and black checkered, collared shirt. On her right ring finger, she has a silver-colored ring shaped like a treble clef, and on her left wrist, she wears a thin yellow bracelet. She is smiling and looking towards the right while eating a slice of pizza held in her right hand, and she also holds a small piece of food in her left hand. The second woman, positioned to the right, has long, dark hair and is dressed in a black and white striped shirt. She wears a small, silver-colored ring on her right ring finger. This woman is smiling and looking towards the first woman, holding a small piece of food in her right hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a brightly lit, modern kitchen during the day. In the background, white cabinets and a tiled backsplash are visible, illuminated by warm under-cabinet lighting. Two young women are in the foreground, eating slices of pizza. The woman on the left wears a white and black plaid shirt and has a silver-colored ring shaped like a treble clef on her finger, while the woman to her right wears a striped shirt.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot features two women positioned in the foreground. The first woman occupies the left and central portion of the frame, while the second woman is on the right side, slightly behind the first. In the out-of-focus background, a brightly lit kitchen is visible. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the clip.",
