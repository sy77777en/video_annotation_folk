    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a majestic mountain scenery shot, capturing the immense scale of a jagged, snow-covered peak rising into a sky of deep blue and white clouds. Sunlight breaks through the cloud cover to illuminate the upper reaches of the mountain, creating a brilliant glow on the vast fields of snow and ice that contrast sharply with the dark, exposed rock faces below. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the overwhelming grandeur and raw, natural beauty of the alpine environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone moves alongside a towering, snow-covered mountain. The peak is sharp and jagged, with dark, rocky faces exposed beneath a thick layer of white snow and ice. Vast snowfields and glaciers cover the surrounding slopes. Above, a patch of deep blue sky is visible through breaks in the white, drifting clouds that partially obscure the upper reaches of the mountain range.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot focused on a large, snow-covered mountain. Initially, the mountain's peak is positioned in the center-right of the frame, rising from the middle ground into the background. A snowy ridge occupies the bottom-left foreground. In the top of the frame, white clouds partially obscure the upper mountain, with a patch of blue sky visible in the top-left. The camera, positioned at a high angle level with the mountain's mid-section, moves forward and alongside the peak. As it advances, the foreground ridge recedes to the left, and the main mountain face becomes more central and dominant, revealing more of its vast, textured slopes.",
