    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full-body shot of Tom, the cat, who enters from the left side of the frame and moves across the foreground of the scene, with his body extending from the left toward the center. Jerry, the mouse, is initially visible in the middle ground near the center-right of the frame, trapped under an upside-down transparent goblet on a pillow, with a black remote control positioned just above him in the frame. The bed and pillows occupy the lower and central portions of the frame, while the dark brown headboard and curtains form the background, spanning the upper part of the frame. As Tom reaches for Jerry, his arms and hands move toward the center, interacting with the goblet and the mouse. Tom then wraps Jerry in a white cloth, holding the bundled mouse in his left hand, which is raised into the center of the frame. In the final moment, Tom\u2019s hands and the bundled cloth rise vertically from the bottom center of the frame, dominating the foreground, while the bed, remote control, and background elements remain static. Throughout the sequence, the camera maintains a height level with the subjects, and the shot size shifts from a full-body view of Tom to a close-up of his hands and the bundled Jerry, emphasizing the spatial transition from a wider to a tighter framing as Tom prepares to exit the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two animated characters: a large blue-gray anthropomorphic cat with white paws, a white face, and pink inner ears, and a small brown mouse with large ears and a tan belly. The cat, named Tom, is standing on a bed and is focused on the mouse, named Jerry, who is trapped inside an upside-down transparent goblet on the pillow beside a black remote control. Tom eagerly wraps Jerry in a white cloth with both hands. Holding the bundled package in his left hand, Tom jumps off the bed, highlighting the dynamic between the two characters.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a softly lit bedroom with beige and brown tones. A large bed with neatly arranged, light tan bedding and a dark brown headboard is positioned against the wall, with thick, brown curtains hanging in the background. In the lower middle of the scene, two white pillows are stacked on the bedside. A black remote control and an upside-down transparent high-heeled glass with Jerry inside rest on the pillows. Another transparent high-heeled glass stands in the lower left corner. The scene features the interaction between two animated characters using a white cloth, unrelated to the bedding. The overall environment is calm and orderly.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows Tom chasing Jerry with dramatic changes in shot size. Tom first appears in a full-body shot as he jumps in from the side of the screen. He then puts Jerry in a bag. In the final moment, Tom attempts to jump down and exit the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
