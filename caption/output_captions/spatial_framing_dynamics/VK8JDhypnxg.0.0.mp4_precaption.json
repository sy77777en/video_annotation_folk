    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A tall, dark gray, rectangular monolith floats vertically in the center of the scene, suspended above a body of water with small, rippling waves. The monolith appears to be composed of several stacked, geometric segments that subtly shift and reconfigure their shape. The entire scene is heavily obscured by a dense, white fog, and the image has a distorted, glitchy quality with visible scan lines and chromatic aberration.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor coastal setting with a calm, misty seascape under diffuse daylight. The horizon is obscured by thick fog, softening the boundary between the sky and the water. Gentle waves roll onto the shore in the foreground, their surfaces reflecting muted gray and blue tones. A large, vertical rectangular structure with smooth, featureless surfaces and a solid, dark gray color floats above the water near the center of the scene. The structure\u2019s edges are sharply defined, and its matte finish contrasts with the hazy atmosphere. Intermittent lightning effects flash across the scene, accompanied by blurred, colorful patterns in the background, adding dynamic visual interest. The overall color palette is subdued, dominated by pale grays and blues, and the scene is framed by black cinematic bars at the top and bottom, which are overlay elements not part of the environment. No other objects or subjects are present, and the environment remains still and quiet throughout the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot presents a tall, rectangular monolith positioned in the center of the frame, floating in the middle ground above a body of water. Rippling waves occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame, while a dense fog fills the middle ground and background, obscuring the horizon. The monolith remains stationary in its central position, though its internal segments subtly shift and reconfigure. The camera is positioned at the monolith's level and remains static throughout the video.",
