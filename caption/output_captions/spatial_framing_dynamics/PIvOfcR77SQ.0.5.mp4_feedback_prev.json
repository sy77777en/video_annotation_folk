    "pre_caption": "The video commences with a wide, eye-level shot of the yurt's interior. Initially, a blue chest of drawers is in the center-left middle ground, a blue armchair is to its right in the middle ground, and a tall wooden cabinet is on the right middle ground. A kitchenette area with a stool in the foreground is partially visible on the left, and a grey rug lies in the bottom-center foreground. The yurt's lattice wall and beamed ceiling form the background. The camera then pans left, causing the armchair and cabinet to move out of frame to the right, while the blue chest of drawers shifts to the far right middle ground. The kitchenette area, now showing two stools, becomes more prominent in the right middle ground. A double bed enters from the left, settling into the center and left middle ground, and a grey sofa appears in the far left middle ground. A central support pole is now visible in the center-left middle ground. Briefly, a person's left hand appears in the bottom-left foreground as the pan concludes, maintaining the wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an interior scenery shot, offering a panoramic tour of a furnished yurt. The absence of a singular main subject allows the focus to rest on the overall environment, layout, and cozy atmosphere of the accommodation. The yurt's distinctive circular structure is evident, with its conical roof supported by radiating wooden beams and characteristic lattice walls. Key furnishings visible include a double bed adorned with patterned, festive bedding and decorative pillows, a grey sofa, a blue chest of drawers, a compact wooden kitchenette area complete with stools and a mini-fridge, a blue armchair with a furry throw, and a tall wooden cabinet. A fluffy grey rug on the dark floor and various small decorative items, including Christmas-themed gnomes, enhance the rustic and inviting feel of the space. The interior is primarily illuminated by artificial light from bulbs mounted on the central pole of the yurt, with wall-mounted electric heaters also visible. As the camera pans left, a person's left hand becomes visible in the lower left corner of the frame, seemingly introducing the yurt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video offers a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, panning across the interior of a furnished yurt. The circular structure features exposed wooden lattice walls and a conical roof with wooden beams lined with white fabric, supported by two wooden poles positioned on either side of the foot of the double bed. The pole on the right side has a light bulb attached, providing artificial lighting. The space is carpeted in dark grey with a light grey rug in the center. Furniture includes a double bed with patterned bedding featuring red, white, and grey Christmas-themed gnomes, and grey towels. A blue wooden three-drawer dresser, a blue fabric armchair with a brown furry throw, and a dark grey sofa are also present. While a small kitchenette area with a wooden counter, mini-fridge, and two light wooden stools is mentioned, it is not clearly visible in the video. A tall, light-colored wooden cabinet and white electric heaters mounted on the walls are visible, along with various small decorative items, including Christmas gnomes, placed around the room.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
