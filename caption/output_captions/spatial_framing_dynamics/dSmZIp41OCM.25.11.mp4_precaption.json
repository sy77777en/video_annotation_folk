    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a stylized, cartoon-like video game scene, a stone well sits at the center of a circular brick path. Standing next to the well is an anthropomorphic scarecrow. The scarecrow has a round, orange, pumpkin-like head with a carved smiling face and is dressed in a dark grey coat. At the bottom of the screen, a user interface displays a gold coin icon with the number 123, an inventory bar showing various bags and items with their respective quantities, and two vertical resource bars, one blue and one yellow, on the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 2D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the scene is set in a stylized, grassy yard at dusk. At the center is a stone well, surrounded by a circular brick pathway. A scarecrow-like figure with a pumpkin head and a grey coat stands beside the well. Several garden plots in the background are enclosed by white picket fences, and there is a bush with red flowers nearby. The scene includes a game heads-up display as an overlay. At the bottom left, a coin icon shows the number 123. A central inventory bar displays various items and quantities. On the right, two vertical status bars, one partially filled with blue and the other full of yellow, are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static, wide shot from a high-angle perspective. In the middle ground, a scarecrow and a stone well are positioned in the center of the frame, encircled by a circular brick path. The path is set within a grassy yard that fills the majority of the scene. In the background, at the top of the frame, are garden plots enclosed by fences. A game interface is overlaid in the foreground at the bottom of the screen, featuring a coin count on the bottom left, an inventory bar in the bottom center, and two vertical resource bars on the bottom right.",
