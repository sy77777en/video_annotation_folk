    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a nighttime cityscape viewed through a large window, showcasing a sprawling urban area with numerous lights and a busy road with moving traffic. As the scene progresses, a man is revealed in the foreground. He has light skin and short, light-colored hair. The man is positioned to the right, partially obscuring the view of the city as he comes into focus. His presence adds a human element to the otherwise expansive city view, creating a contrast between the individual and the vast urban environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases a nighttime cityscape viewed from a high vantage point, likely through large windows, as indicated by two vertical bars framing the glass. The urban environment is illuminated by countless city lights, creating a sprawling network of glowing streets and buildings. The scene offers a clear view of the city extending to the horizon, with a dark sky indicating a clear night without visible weather disturbances. Notable visual elements include the bright, linear patterns of traffic lights on the roads and the varied illumination from buildings, some with distinct neon signs. The overall atmosphere is calm and expansive, capturing the vastness of the city at night.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a close-up shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a nighttime cityscape viewed from a high vantage point. Two dark vertical window frames are positioned in the foreground on the left and right. In the middle ground, a busy highway with moving traffic occupies the bottom left, with a large, lit stadium to its left. The background is filled with the sprawling, illuminated city extending to the horizon. A man's head then slowly enters the frame from the bottom right, moving into the foreground and transitioning the shot into a close-up. In the final composition, the man occupies the right foreground, with the cityscape now visible in the background to the left, as the camera is positioned at his level.",
