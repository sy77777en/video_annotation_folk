    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person engaged in construction work, filmed from a head-mounted camera perspective. The individual, with medium skin tone, is wearing a light-colored shirt with rolled-up sleeves and blue flip-flops. They are handling red bricks, which are scattered on the ground. A green bowl containing a gray mixture, likely cement, is nearby. In another part of the video, a partially constructed brick wall is visible, along with more bricks and construction materials on the ground. The setting suggests an outdoor construction site.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a first-person POV, takes place outdoors during the day at a construction site with a focus on bricklaying. The ground is covered with reddish-brown dirt and scattered bricks, some whole and others broken. A person\u2019s hands are visible, interacting with the bricks, indicating active construction work. Two round containers filled with gray cement are present, suggesting ongoing masonry tasks. In the background, a partially constructed brick wall is visible, while greenery is located on the ground outside the construction area, adding a natural element to the scene. The environment is dry. The overall scene conveys a sense of manual labor and construction activity.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video captures a first-person perspective of a construction worker engaging in bricklaying activities. The camera is positioned above the subject, providing a view of their feet and lower legs in the foreground. The worker's hands are frequently seen manipulating red bricks, which are scattered across the reddish-brown dirt ground in the middle ground. Two round containers filled with gray cement are placed near the center-left of the scene, one slightly closer to the bottom left corner. The worker moves between different areas of the construction site, transitioning from a pile of bricks on the left side to a partially constructed brick wall on the right. This movement shifts the focus from the left to the right side of the frame, revealing more bricks and construction materials in the middle ground. The background includes patches of greenery on the ground outside the construction area, situated towards the top right. The camera remains steady throughout, maintaining a consistent height relative to the subject, emphasizing the ongoing manual labor and construction activity.",
