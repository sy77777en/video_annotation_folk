    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a hand interacting with a control panel. The hand is positioned in the bottom left of the frame, in the foreground, actively pressing buttons labeled \"PROG\" and \"RAD NAV.\" The control panel occupies the majority of the frame, with its teal surface and black buttons extending across the middle ground. The digital display is located in the center-right, in the background, showing green and blue text against a black screen. The camera is positioned above the subjects, capturing the hand's movements and the illuminated text. As the hand moves, the focus shifts slightly to different buttons, maintaining the close-up framing throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up view of a hand interacting with a control panel. The hand, with a light skin tone, is pressing buttons on a device that has a dark screen displaying green and white text and numbers. The panel includes various labeled buttons, such as \"PROG\" and \"RAD NAV,\" and the hand is actively engaged in pressing these buttons, suggesting interaction with the device's interface. The focus is on the hand's movement and the illuminated text on the screen, which appears to be part of a technical or navigational system.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene depicts a close-up view of a control panel with a digital display, set indoors. The panel is teal with a matte finish, featuring a series of black buttons labeled with white text, such as \"RAD NAV\" and \"PROG.\" The display screen shows bright green and blue text against a black background, indicating various data points and numbers. A finger is interacting with the panel, pressing buttons, which suggests active engagement with the device.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
