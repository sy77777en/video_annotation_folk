    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An older, light-skinned man with white, combed-back hair is depicted in profile, looking toward the left. He wears a gray suit jacket over a white collared shirt. With his left hand, he holds the bottom of a large, rectangular photograph, while his right hand is raised, pointing with his index finger at the center of the image. The photograph itself has a teal-colored background and shows a dark, vertical, rectangular object with some mottled green and dark texturing on its surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an animated indoor setting with brown-toned walls, an older man with white hair, dressed in a grey suit, holds a rectangular photograph. He points his finger at a dark, vertical object depicted in the photo, which is set against a solid teal background. In the blurred background of the room, the dark silhouette of a multi-tiered structure is visible. The scene is rendered in a hand-drawn style.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, an older man is positioned on the right side of the frame. He holds a large photograph in the center-left foreground, pointing with his right index finger to the center of the image. In the background, a dark silhouette of a structure is visible in the center-right. The camera is positioned at the man's eye level.",
