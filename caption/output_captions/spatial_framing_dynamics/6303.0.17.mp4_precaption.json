    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with medium skin tone and an afro hairstyle, wearing a bright red, long-sleeved shirt. He is expressive, with his mouth open wide, possibly singing or shouting. In one instance, he raises his right arm with a clenched fist, while his left hand rests on his abdomen. The setting appears to be a room with a checkered floor and vibrant lighting, contributing to a dynamic atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a vibrant, eclectic room with a checkered black-and-white floor and walls featuring a geometric pattern. The setting is illuminated by colorful neon lights, casting a dynamic glow throughout the space. A large circular mirror and various electronic equipment are visible, contributing to a lively, energetic atmosphere. The time of day is indeterminate due to the artificial lighting. The scene includes a person in a bright red outfit, adding a striking contrast to the surroundings. The environment is filled with movement and energy, with the person actively engaging with the space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a man with medium skin tone and an afro hairstyle, wearing a bright red, long-sleeved shirt. Initially, he is positioned slightly to the right of the center in the frame, occupying the middle ground. The camera is at his eye level. As the video progresses, he raises his right arm with a clenched fist, moving it from the center to the top right of the frame, while his left hand remains on his abdomen. The background consists of a checkered floor and walls with a geometric pattern, illuminated by colorful neon lights. The setting includes a large circular mirror and electronic equipment, positioned in the background, contributing to the dynamic atmosphere. The man\u2019s movements and the vibrant lighting create a lively and energetic scene.",
