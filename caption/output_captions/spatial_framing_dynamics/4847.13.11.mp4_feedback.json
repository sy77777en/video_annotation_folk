    "pre_caption": "This medium shot is framed with a large table holding a map spread across the foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a younger man in a top hat is positioned at the center-left, leaning over the table and pointing at the map. To his right, an older man stands at the center-right, also leaning in. An armchair is visible in the middle ground on the far left. The background features a large map of the United States on the wall at the top-left and center, with a counter below it. On the right side of the background, two other men are standing, and framed pictures are on the wall at the top-right. The younger man briefly gestures with his right hand toward the right. The camera is static and positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a room with a sepia tint, a younger man and an older man stand over a large table, examining a map spread across it. The younger man, on the left, has dark hair and wears a dark suit, a white collared shirt with a dark tie, and a tall black top hat; he leans forward, pointing at a spot on the map. To his right, the older man, who has short white hair and also wears a dark suit, leans in to look at the map. In the background, another man in a dark suit stands with his back partially turned, and a fourth man is partially visible behind him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This sepia-toned video shows an indoor scene in what appears to be a vintage office or planning room. The back wall is dominated by a large map of the United States, with visible labels for \"TEXAS,\" \"GULF OF MEXICO,\" and \"ATL. OCEAN,\" and the words \"AMERICAN RAILROADS\" written below it. To the right of this map are two framed pictures, both depicting ships, and another partial map. A long, dark counter runs along the wall beneath the maps. In the foreground, a large, dark table is covered with an unrolled map marked with a grid. In the middle ground, a dark, upholstered armchair is positioned. Several men in dark suits are present; two are in the foreground, leaning over the table to examine the map, with one man in a top hat pointing at it.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
