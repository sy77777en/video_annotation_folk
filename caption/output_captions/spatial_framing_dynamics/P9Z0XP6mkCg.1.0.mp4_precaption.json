    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black and white, sepia-toned photograph depicts the head of a young man, possibly a sculpture or bust. He has dark, wavy hair styled in a pompadour with prominent, long sideburns. His face is shown in a three-quarter profile, looking towards the right. He has a strong jawline, and his mouth is slightly open. The image is presented as a torn photograph, with a jagged, ripped edge along the bottom, set against a plain white background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A static, monochromatic composition features a sepia-toned image of a young man's head against a dark, textured background. The head is depicted in profile, looking toward the right. The image is presented as a torn photograph, with a jagged, white paper edge running horizontally across the bottom of the frame. The entire arrangement is set against a solid black background. An overlay of text reading \"wikipedia.org\" is present in the bottom-left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "A static, close-up shot centers on a sepia-toned image of a young man's head. The head is positioned in the middle ground against a dark, textured background. In the foreground, a jagged, torn paper edge runs horizontally across the bottom of the frame, revealing a white surface below. Text is located in the bottom-left corner. The camera remains at the subject's height throughout the shot.",
