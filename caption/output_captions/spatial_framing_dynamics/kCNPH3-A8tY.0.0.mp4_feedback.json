The camera then slowly pulls back while rotating clockwise, transitioning into a high-angle, wide shot. In the final composition, the full bodies of the man and woman are visible in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. They lie on their backs with their heads together, their bodies extending in opposite directions. They are surrounded by a circle of scattered black and white photographs on the floor, also in the middle ground. A long, rectangular lamp on a stand becomes visible in the middle ground, positioned above their bodies.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man and a woman are lying on their backs on the floor with their heads close together, initially positioned with the man on the left and the woman on the right. The man has fair skin, short dark hair, and is wearing a dark sweater. The woman has fair skin, long dark hair, and is dressed in a dark, long-sleeved top with cutouts at the shoulders. They are lying with their legs stretched out in opposite directions. The view begins as a close-up on their faces and then pulls back and rotates to a high-angle shot, revealing their full bodies spread out.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's eye view, an indoor scene unfolds on a plain floor. A man and a woman lie on their backs, their heads close together, surrounded by a wide circle of scattered black and white photographs. The environment is bathed in a cool, blue-toned light emanating from a single source\u2014a long, rectangular lamp on a stand that becomes visible as the camera slowly pulls away. The photographs, varying in size, are strewn across the floor, creating a cluttered surface. The camera's gradual upward movement reveals the full extent of the scene, showing the subjects' entire bodies arranged in opposite directions amidst the sea of images.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: It starts with a close-up of the heads of two people lying on the ground. As the camera continues to rotate upward, it reveals the full bodies of the two individuals and their surroundings.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
