    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with brown skin and short, dark, curly hair is shown running along a paved path. He is wearing a light-colored, patterned, long-sleeved hooded jacket over black shorts, with black socks and black and white running shoes. He stops running, steps up onto a low ledge next to a wooden bench, and bends over to adjust his right shoe.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A paved asphalt path, marked with a single yellow line, winds through a dense forest. The trail is flanked on both sides by lush green foliage, ferns, and numerous tall, thin-trunked trees. Sunlight filters through the dense canopy, casting dappled light and distinct shadows across the path. A person wearing a light-colored hooded jacket and dark shorts jogs along the path before pausing near a wooden bench to adjust their shoe.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a man in the center middle ground, running toward the camera along a paved path that recedes into a forest in the background. As he runs closer, the framing transitions to a full shot. He then moves to the left foreground, where he stops, steps onto a low ledge next to a wooden bench, and bends over. The path remains in the center and right foreground, with the forest filling the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
