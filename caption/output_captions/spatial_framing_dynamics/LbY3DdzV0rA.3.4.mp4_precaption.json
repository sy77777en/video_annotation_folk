    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a dramatic time-lapse landscape scenery shot, where the focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific main subject. A massive storm system dominates the frame, with its bright, sunlit white tops contrasting against a dark, menacing grey underbelly that churns and expands across the sky. A concentrated shaft of heavy rain visibly descends from the cloud base onto the vast, arid plain below, which is colored in shades of yellow and green with sparse vegetation. In the far distance, a faint mountain range sits on the horizon, and a paved road cuts through the landscape on the right, further emphasizing the sheer size of the powerful weather event.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse captures a dramatic weather event over a vast, arid landscape during the daytime. A massive, churning storm cloud dominates the sky, its upper portions bright white against a patch of blue sky, while its base is a dark, menacing grey. A concentrated column of heavy rain falls from the center of the cloud, hitting the distant, flat plain. The landscape below is a mix of dry, yellow-brown earth and sparse green vegetation. A paved road is visible on the right, stretching toward the horizon, and a faint mountain range can be seen in the far distance on the left.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from an elevated viewpoint looking across a vast landscape. The bottom third of the frame is occupied by an arid plain in the foreground and middle ground, with a road situated on the bottom right, extending into the distance. The upper two-thirds of the frame are dominated by a massive storm cloud in the center and middle ground, with a patch of blue sky visible in the top left background and a faint mountain range on the far left horizon. In the time-lapse, the storm cloud churns and expands, moving from left to right across the frame, while a concentrated shaft of rain in the center background sweeps across the distant plain in unison with the cloud's movement.",
