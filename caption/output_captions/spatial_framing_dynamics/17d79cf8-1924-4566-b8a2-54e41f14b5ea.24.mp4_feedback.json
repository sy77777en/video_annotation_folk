The left hand initially holds a brick in the bottom center foreground, while the right hand holds a trowel in the bottom right foreground. A bucket containing mortar is positioned in the bottom left foreground. A partially constructed brick wall stretches across the middle ground, running from the center-left towards the top right. Greenery and rocks are visible in the background at the top left and top center. A string line extends horizontally across the middle ground, slightly above the wall.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person engaged in bricklaying, holding a brick in their left hand and a trowel in their right hand. The individual, whose arms and hands are visible, has a darker skin tone and wears a light-colored long-sleeve shirt and patterned shorts. They are handling reddish-brown, rectangular bricks and are seen placing them on a partially constructed wall. The person is also wearing sandals. The scene is viewed from a head-mounted camera perspective, focusing on the construction process.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of an outdoor construction site during the day. The setting features a partially built brick wall with red bricks stacked unevenly. The ground is a mix of concrete and dirt, with a bucket of mortar nearby. A trowel and some string are visible, indicating ongoing construction work. The scene includes a glimpse of greenery in the background, suggesting a natural environment surrounding the site. The lighting is bright, indicating clear weather.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
