    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two prominent celestial bodies. The first is a reddish-brown planet with a textured surface, characterized by craters and dark patches, indicative of Mars. Accompanying it is a small, irregularly shaped gray object resembling a meteorite. The second celestial body is a vibrant blue and green planet, initially displaying only continents and oceans, without any cloud formations, clearly representing Earth. The video transitions from the reddish-brown planet with its companion object to the colorful depiction of Earth, highlighting the distinct visual characteristics of each stage of Earth's transformation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video offers a captivating view of outer space, focusing on Earth's transformation through three distinct stages. Initially, Earth is shown with its reddish-brown surface, marked by craters and canyons. In the second stage, the scene shifts to a view of Earth where only the continents and oceans are visible, devoid of any clouds. The final stage, Earth is shown with its vibrant blue oceans and green and brown landmasses, accompanied by swirling white clouds. An object resembling a meteorite is visible in space, rather than a moon or asteroid. The setting is the vast, dark expanse of space, dotted with distant stars, providing a stark contrast to the vivid colors of the planets. The video captures the serene and majestic nature of the cosmos from an objective perspective.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of two celestial bodies against the backdrop of outer space. Initially, a reddish-brown planet occupies the center-right of the frame, with a small, irregularly shaped gray object positioned in the foreground on the left side. Both are set against a starry background, with the reddish-brown planet in the middle ground and the gray object closer to the viewer. As the video progresses, the reddish-brown planet gradually transforms into a vibrant blue and green planet, shifting its position slightly towards the center. The gray object moves out of the frame, leaving the transformed planet as the sole focus. The camera remains at a consistent height relative to the planets, maintaining a steady perspective throughout the transition. The final state showcases the blue and green planet prominently in the center, with its detailed surface features becoming more apparent as the transformation completes. The spatial dynamics highlight the gradual shift from one celestial body to another, emphasizing the change in appearance and the removal of the gray object from the scene.",
