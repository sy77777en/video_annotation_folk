    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A high-angle, close-up view captures a white soccer goal with a white, square-meshed net. A spiral-patterned ball is caught in the net, while the ground within the goal is a uniform, bright green, bordered by a thick white line. Resting on the green surface, parallel to the white line, are two long, black, cylindrical objects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene captures a close-up of a soccer ball positioned near the goal on a vibrant green field. A thick white line runs along the ground in front of the goal. The goal's white net, with its square mesh, is stretched across the frame. Inside the goal, two long, black, cylindrical objects rest on the green surface, parallel to the white line. The area behind the goal is a darker shade of green, and the entire scene is illuminated by bright, even light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, wide perspective, the video presents a static shot of the corner of a soccer goal. The white, square-meshed net dominates the frame, stretching from the top left to the bottom right in the foreground and middle ground. Below the net, in the middle ground, a bright green surface is visible in the bottom and left portions of the frame, bordered at the bottom by a thick white line. Two long, black cylindrical objects rest on this green surface, parallel to the white line; one is in the upper-left middle ground, and the other is more central. A vertical white goalpost is positioned on the right edge, and a darker green surface is visible in the background behind the net.",
