    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a breathtaking cityscape scenery shot of Paris at night, centered on the iconic Eiffel Tower. The tower, illuminated in a brilliant golden-yellow light, stands majestically against the dark, cloudy sky, with a bright blue-white spotlight rotating from its apex. In the foreground, the River Seine flows, its dark water beautifully reflecting the myriad city lights in shimmering streaks of green, blue, and gold. Along the riverbanks, numerous boats are docked, and the city's architecture is lit up, while on the far left, the headlights and taillights of moving vehicles create long, glowing trails of white and red. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to capture the grand scale, vibrant energy, and romantic atmosphere of the urban environment, immersing the viewer in the iconic \"City of Lights.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A nighttime view captures the Eiffel Tower in Paris, illuminated in a golden-yellow light against a dark sky with scattered clouds. A bright, rotating beacon shines from the tower's apex. The structure is positioned beside the Seine River, whose dark water reflects the tower's glow and the surrounding city lights in shimmering green and blue hues. Along the riverbank, boats are docked and moving, and the cityscape is dotted with bright lights from buildings and street lamps. In the lower-left corner, red and white light trails indicate moving traffic on a road. A watermark in the bottom right corner reads \"MATHIEU STANIC PHOTOGRAPHY\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a cityscape scenery at night. The illuminated Eiffel Tower is the primary focal point, positioned in the middle ground, slightly right of the frame's center, and extending into the upper half. The Seine River flows across the lower portion of the frame, from the foreground to the middle ground, with its surface reflecting the city lights. In the bottom left foreground, light trails from moving traffic are visible on a road. The riverbanks, lined with buildings and docked boats, occupy the middle ground on both sides of the river. The dark, cloudy sky fills the background in the upper half of the frame. Movement within the static shot includes a rotating beacon at the tower's apex and the shimmering reflections on the water. The camera is positioned at an elevated height, looking across the river. A watermark is located in the bottom right corner.",
