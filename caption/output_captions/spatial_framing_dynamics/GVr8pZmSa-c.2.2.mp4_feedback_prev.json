    "pre_caption": "The video initially presents no distinct subject, with the frame centered on a small, stone-like object in the foreground, resting on a reddish surface that occupies the bottom foreground. An overlay is visible in the bottom left foreground. A figure then emerges in the center middle ground, initially out of focus. As this figure comes into sharper focus, the shot transitions to a medium shot, with the figure, arms crossed, remaining in the center middle ground. When the figure is fully revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a static close-up of a small, stone-like object on a reddish surface. Then, a figure in a dark suit with crossed arms appears in the middleground, initially out of focus, before gradually coming into sharper focus. Finally, the figure's head and facial features, including light hair, glasses, and a mustache, become visible as the camera seems to adjust or the figure fully materializes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in an indoor environment with moderate lighting. On a reddish-brown table, there are scattered stones in a mix of teal, white, and reddish-brown. A figure, rendered in a desaturated, almost grayscale palette, emerges from the shadows. The figure is dressed in a dark suit and a lighter-colored collared shirt, with light-colored hair and round glasses. They stand with their arms crossed. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"ALBERT REHM\" at the top and \"GERMAN PHILOLOGIST\" at the bottom. The overlay's bottom right corner features three overlapping quarter-circle arcs, contributing to the overall somber and shadowy atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a medium shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
