    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two women relaxing on wooden lounge chairs at a beach setting. The woman on the left has light skin and long blonde hair, wearing a green bikini and sunglasses. She is reclining comfortably. The woman on the right also has light skin and medium-length brown hair, wearing a yellow swimsuit and sunglasses. She is seated with her legs bent, appearing relaxed. Both women are facing each other, suggesting they might be engaged in conversation. The setting is sunny, with beach umbrellas and other lounge chairs nearby.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor beach setting during the daytime, featuring a sandy area with wooden lounge chairs arranged in rows. The environment is bright and sunny, with clear skies and vibrant sunlight casting distinct shadows on the sand. The lounge chairs are made of dark wood with slatted designs, and some are occupied by individuals relaxing under the sun. In the background, there are beach umbrellas and a few small structures, possibly part of a beachside facility. The scene conveys a relaxed, leisurely atmosphere typical of a beach resort.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a full shot of two women on wooden lounge chairs in a beach setting. The woman on the left, wearing a green bikini, is positioned in the bottom left of the frame, reclining comfortably in the foreground. The woman on the right, in a yellow swimsuit, is seated with bent legs in the bottom right of the frame, also in the foreground. Both women are facing each other, suggesting interaction. The camera is positioned above them, capturing the scene from a slightly elevated angle. The background includes beach umbrellas and additional lounge chairs, contributing to the beach atmosphere. The spatial composition remains consistent throughout the video, with no significant changes in shot size or subject positioning.",
