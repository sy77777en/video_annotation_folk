    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a dynamic cityscape, resembling a first-person video game experience where the viewer seems to control a green train navigating through the urban environment. Approximately one and a half cars of the green train are visible, adding an interactive and immersive element to the scene. The focus remains on the overall setting, including buildings, roads, and the surrounding area, creating a vivid sense of place and mood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an urban setting on a cloudy day, showcasing a highway elevated above a bustling cityscape. Modern buildings with illuminated windows line the road, highlighting an active city environment. The highway is bordered by streetlights. There is a park with visible trees adjacent to it. A body of water is visible to the right of the highway. The road is smooth and wide, accommodating a large, green vehicle in motion, emphasizing the scene's dynamic nature. Overlays include a white arrow, whose direction changes with the movement of the green train, positioned in the upper center of the screen. Numerical indicators like \"067/650 Passengers\" and \"203,\" along with text such as \"Pier 59,\" are located in the top and bottom corners, providing additional context without being part of the physical environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban cityscape, capturing a broad view of the environment. The highway occupies the central portion of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. On the left side of the frame, modern buildings with illuminated windows are positioned in the background, while streetlights line the road in the middle ground. To the right of the highway, a body of water is visible in the background. A park with trees is situated adjacent to the highway in the middle ground. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned slightly above the level of the highway, providing a clear view of the road and its surroundings. The white arrow overlay is consistently placed in the upper center of the frame throughout the sequence. Numerical indicators and text overlays appear in the top and bottom corners, remaining static in their positions. The camera angle does not change, maintaining a steady perspective on the scene.",
