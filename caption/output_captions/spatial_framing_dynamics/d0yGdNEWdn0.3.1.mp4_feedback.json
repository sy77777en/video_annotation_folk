    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a man positioned slightly left of center in the foreground. He gestures with his hands while speaking; around 0:02, he raises his right hand, palm open, towards the camera, then lowers it, and by 0:04, he is seen holding a small device in his right hand. To his right, a white projection screen occupies the right fifth of the frame in the middle ground to background. To the man's right, and left of the screen, a gray-white column and a partially visible movable whiteboard are situated in the middle ground. A dark red wall forms the background on the far left and behind the man, with a wooden element visible in the lower left corner, also in the middle ground. The camera remains static and at the subject's level throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a middle-aged man with a light skin tone and a beard, wearing a light blue shirt and a red lanyard with a white name tag that reads \"Chris\" in black font. He is positioned slightly to the left of the center in the frame and is holding a small device in one hand, possibly a remote or a pointer, while appearing to speak or present. A black microphone is clipped to the cuff of his left sleeve, with a black audio cable running down to his left waist. His expression is attentive and engaged, suggesting he is addressing an audience or explaining something. The man remains the primary focus throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, likely during a presentation or lecture. To the right, a plain white projection screen occupies approximately one-fifth of the right side of the frame. To the left of the projection screen, the background includes a gray-white column and a movable whiteboard. On the far left, a dark red wall forms the backdrop, with a wooden element, possibly part of a lectern or wall paneling, visible in the lower left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
