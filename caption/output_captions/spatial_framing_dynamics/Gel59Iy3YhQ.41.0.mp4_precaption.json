    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a young person with blonde hair and glasses, wearing a purple shirt, an orange vest, and dark pants. They stand outdoors in front of a rocky wall and a sign that reads \"ODIN FINCH NATIONAL PARK.\" The person holds a blue umbrella over their head with their right hand and reads from a white book held in their left hand. An overlay resembling a camera screen covers the entire video. The video includes a subtitle that reads, \"I will never forget this weekend, Dad.\" The camera quickly zooms in and is unsteady before focusing on the young person as they continue to read.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a wide shot of an outdoor scene at the entrance to \"ODIN FINCH NATIONAL PARK,\" marked by a large, dark brown wooden sign with white lettering. To the left, a rock wall displays a \"Department of the Interior\" emblem. As the camera zooms in unsteadily, the scene transitions to a medium shot focusing on a person with blonde hair and glasses, wearing a purple and orange vest, standing under a light blue umbrella while reading a white book. The scene has a dim, slightly blurry, vintage aesthetic. Overlaid at the bottom of the screen is yellow text reading, \"I will never forget this weekend, Dad,\" along with film reel-like markings and a vertical bar graph on the right side.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot, featuring a young person in the center middle ground, holding an umbrella above them and a book. In the background, a \"ODIN FINCH NATIONAL PARK\" sign is positioned in the top right, while a rocky wall with an emblem occupies the left. Yellow subtitles are overlaid in the bottom center foreground, with film reel-like markings at the bottom and a vertical bar graph on the right, also in the foreground. The camera then executes a quick and unsteady zoom, transitioning to a medium close-up shot. In this new framing, the young person remains in the center middle ground, with the umbrella now partially visible at the top center and the book appearing more prominent. The background sign and wall are consequently partially obscured, with the foreground overlays remaining in their respective positions. Throughout the shot, the camera maintains the subject's eye level.",
