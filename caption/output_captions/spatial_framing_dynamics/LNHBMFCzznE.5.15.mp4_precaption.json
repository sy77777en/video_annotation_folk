    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a woman with fair skin and brown, shoulder-length hair, who is standing on a stage and speaking. She is wearing a sleeveless black dress that ends just above her knees and black knee-high boots. She holds a microphone in her right hand and gestures with her left as she addresses an audience. The stage she stands on is elevated and covered with a square red carpet. In the foreground, seated in the dark, is the audience, visible primarily as silhouettes illuminated by the blue light from the stage. They are positioned below the stage and are watching the woman speak.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark auditorium, viewed from the perspective of the audience looking toward a raised stage. A woman in a black dress stands on a bright red rectangular carpet at the center of the stage. The background features a white, vertically slatted wall structure illuminated in blue, with the number \"1733\" visible on its side. To the right of this wall is a decorative stack of circular objects, also lit in blue, creating a honeycomb-like pattern. The rest of the auditorium is dimly lit, with the audience visible only as dark silhouettes in their seats, and a white couch can be seen on the right side of the seating area.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A wide shot frames a woman standing on an elevated stage in the top left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. In the background, a white, vertically slatted wall is visible behind her on the left, and a stack of blue-lit circular objects is to her right. The audience, seen as silhouettes, occupies the foreground, filling the bottom and right portions of the frame. A white couch is situated in the middle ground on the far right, adjacent to the audience. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and remains static throughout the shot.",
