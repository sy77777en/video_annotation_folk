    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases an intriguing abstract figure composed of thin black and white lines, resembling a skeletal bicycle or a stick figure riding one, enhanced by small green, blue, and red circular dots clustered near its center. This unique artistic element is complemented by five short, thick, black horizontal lines arranged in a staggered, ascending pattern from the lower left to the upper right of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view 2D gaming video captures a scene in profile within a minimalist, abstract digital space featuring a plain, light gray background. Several short, thick, black horizontal lines serve as platforms, initially positioned from the lower left corner and extending in a staggered, ascending pattern across the screen to the upper right. A small, complex object, composed of various colored parts including small green, blue, and red elements, navigates these platforms, starting near the center-left of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is presented as an extreme wide shot. A small, abstract figure, composed of lines and colored dots, begins in the center-left middle ground, situated on the second lowest of five short, black horizontal lines. These lines, serving as platforms, are static and arranged in a staggered, ascending pattern from the bottom left to the top right of the frame, all within the middle ground against a plain light gray background. The abstract figure moves dynamically from left to right, hopping upwards from one platform to the next, progressing towards the top right of the frame. The camera maintains a side-view perspective, positioned at the height of the action.",
