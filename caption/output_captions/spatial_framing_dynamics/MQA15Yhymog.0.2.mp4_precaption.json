    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a level-angle perspective on a surfboard, the entire body of a woman is visible as she stands on the board. She is wearing a dark-colored bikini. Her bare feet are initially planted on the red surface of the surfboard, with a black logo beneath them. As she moves backward, the logo shifts to a position in front of her.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on a red surfboard captures the experience of riding on the ocean under a bright, sunny sky. Initially, only a person's wet legs and feet are visible standing on the board. As she steps backward, her entire body comes into view. The board, which has a black logo near its center, moves through the water as white sea spray and foam splash over its textured surface. To the right, a green-blue wave with a white crest is breaking.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a woman's lower body, positioned in the center of the frame as she stands on a red surfboard in the foreground. The surfboard occupies the bottom of the frame, with a black logo centered beneath her feet. A breaking wave is visible in the middle ground on the right, set against the sky in the background. The woman then steps backward on the board, causing the framing to transition into a full shot that captures her entire body. In this new composition, she remains in the center but is now positioned further back in the middle ground, with the surfboard's logo now visible in the foreground in front of her. The camera is positioned at the subject's level on the surfboard, providing a low-angle perspective as it moves with the board.",
