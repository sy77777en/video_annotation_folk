    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A hand belonging to a Black person, with a red sleeve visible at the wrist, reaches into the frame to press a glowing blue button on a vertical, rectangular smart lock. The black device, mounted on a dark paneled door, is outlined in blue light and displays the numbers \"1424\" vertically in white. After the hand retracts, a bright light shines from the top of the device, and a semi-transparent, holographic projection of a man materializes on the door. This man is white with short, dark hair and is seen in profile, looking to his right. He holds a dark, rectangular object in his right hand, and the hologram is tinged with blue and red light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, is directed at a dark, paneled wall in a dimly lit indoor setting. In the center of the wall is a vertical, rectangular digital panel with a glowing blue border. The panel displays the numbers '1424' vertically in a thin, blue font. A circular button at the bottom glows blue, and a sensor at the top shines with a bright white light. A semi-transparent, glowing blue and red overlay of a man in profile appears on the wall, looking toward the panel while holding a dark object.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is shot from a first-person perspective, showing a hand of a Black person with red clothes pressing an object with the numbers 1424, likely a smart lock, placed on a door. The hand then exits the frame, and the object\u2019s projection component starts to glow, revealing a holographic projection of a man, showing his head and arms.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "From a static, first-person perspective, the shot is centered on a vertical smart lock mounted on a door in the middle ground. A hand enters the frame from the bottom left foreground, moves toward the center to press a button at the bottom of the lock, and then retracts, exiting from the bottom left. Following this action, a semi-transparent holographic projection of a man's head and upper body materializes, superimposed over the door in the center of the frame and occupying the middle ground. The hologram is shown in profile, positioned to the left of the smart lock's display, and faces toward the right of the frame. The camera remains stationary and at the subject's level throughout the entire shot.",
