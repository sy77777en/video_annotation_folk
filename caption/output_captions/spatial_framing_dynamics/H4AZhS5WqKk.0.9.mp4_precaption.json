    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, anthropomorphic blue-gray cat with a light gray belly, a white muzzle, and yellow eyes stands in the center, looking leftward or rightward as his expression shifts from a slight smile to a frown. He is flanked by two smaller, cartoonish figures. On his right, a gray cat dressed as an angel in a white robe stands on a small cloud, holding a golden harp and wearing a white halo. On his left, a red cat depicted as a devil with horns and a pointed tail stands on another small cloud, holding a red trident and gesturing toward the central figure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark, wet alley at night, with a prominent brick wall and a large, dark pipe on the left. A large, blue-gray cat character stands in the center. In the foreground, two elements flank the central character: on the left, a small, gray cat dressed as an angel with a halo and harp stands on a white cloud, and on the right, a small, red cat dressed as a devil with a trident stands on another white cloud. The background is dark, with some out-of-focus white lights visible on the right, and the wetness of the brick wall and the large, dark pipe suggests recent rain.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a medium shot showing the main character (Tom) in the center, flanked by smaller secondary characters (angel and devil versions of himself) positioned symmetrically on either side, both on small clouds, creating a balanced composition.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a medium shot centered on a large, blue-gray cat positioned in the middle ground. He is flanked by two smaller figures in the foreground: an angel cat on a cloud to the left and a devil cat on a cloud to the right, creating a balanced composition. In the background, a dark pipe is situated on the left against a brick wall, with out-of-focus lights visible in the far background on the right. Spatially, the central cat turns his head from left to right. The devil cat on the right gestures as its cloud moves slightly forward and toward the center, closing the distance with the main character, while the angel cat on the left remains stationary. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
