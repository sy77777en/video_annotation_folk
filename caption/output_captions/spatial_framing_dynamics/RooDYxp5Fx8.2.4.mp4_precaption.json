    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a quiet urban street in Japan under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The camera pans slowly to the right, revealing a wide, paved sidewalk next to a multi-lane road, which features a green belt in the middle, enhancing the scenic quality of the street. A large, green pedestrian overpass with noticeably rusted stairs spans the road. On the left, modern buildings line the street, where a single person walks away from the camera, while a blue city bus stop sign stands on the right. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is instead on the overall environment and the tranquil, sunny atmosphere of the urban landscape, emphasizing the scale of the street and architecture over any single element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moves along a wide sidewalk in a Japanese city on a bright, sunny day. On the left, a person walks past a modern building with a brick base and reflective windows. The sidewalk is paved with gray and white tiles and marked with yellow tactile strips. Directly ahead, a green pedestrian overpass with visibly rusted stairs spans a multi-lane asphalt road. To the right, a blue and white city bus stop stands at the edge of the sidewalk, while a median with green shrubbery is situated in the middle of the wide road. The sky is a vibrant blue with fluffy white clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective. Initially, a person is in the bottom left foreground, walking away from the camera along a sidewalk. Buildings occupy the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. A pedestrian overpass is positioned in the center-left middle ground, spanning a road that fills the center and right portions of the scene. A bus stop sign stands in the right foreground. The camera then pans slowly to the right. As it moves, the person and the bus stop exit the frame, while the overpass shifts to become the central element in the middle ground. This movement reveals more of the road and a green median to the right. Throughout the shot, the background, featuring distant buildings and a sky with clouds, remains at the top of the frame.",
