    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person's hand with a light skin tone holds a smartphone that has a flat-sided, gold-colored metal frame. In the other hand, a silver, metallic utility knife is held, with its sharp, triangular razor blade extended. The pointed tip of the blade is carefully inserted into the narrow earpiece slit at the top edge of the phone, in the seam between the dark glass screen and the metal frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a plain white background, a close-up shot captures a smartphone with a metallic, champagne-colored frame being held in one hand. With the other hand, a person carefully inserts the tip of a silver utility knife blade into the thin seam between the phone's dark screen and its metal casing, near the top edge. The blade's point is positioned precisely in the gap where the glass meets the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In an extreme close-up shot, a smartphone is positioned in the foreground, occupying the left side of the frame and held by a finger visible at the bottom left. In the right foreground, a utility knife is held by a finger at the bottom right, with its blade extending toward the left and inserted into the seam between the phone's screen and frame. The knife is then withdrawn from the phone, moving from left to right, while the phone remains stationary. The entire scene is set against a plain white background, with the camera positioned at the subject's level.",
