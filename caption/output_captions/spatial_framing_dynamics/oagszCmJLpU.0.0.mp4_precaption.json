    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot dominated by a colossal and ominous storm system. Dark, turbulent grey and black clouds churn across the sky, with a prominent, low-hanging white shelf cloud stretching across the middle, suggesting an approaching severe weather event. Below this menacing sky, a vast, flat field of vibrant yellow-greenish plants or grass extends to the horizon, where a small cluster of distant trees and buildings is dwarfed by the immense scale of the cloud formation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene captures a vast, flat field of yellow-greenish plants or grass stretching toward a distant horizon where a small cluster of trees is visible. Dominating the sky is a massive, turbulent storm system. The clouds are a mix of dark grey and light grey as they churn and advance, with a lower, brighter white shelf cloud formation rolling across the landscape. A white curtain of rain appears to fall from the base of the storm in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot of a landscape is captured from a low angle, looking up towards the sky. A massive storm system dominates the top and central two-thirds of the frame, positioned in the middle ground and background. A prominent, lower-hanging white shelf cloud stretches horizontally across the center of the scene. Occupying the bottom third of the frame, a flat, yellow-green field extends from the foreground to the distant horizon. A small cluster of trees and buildings is visible in the background, situated on the bottom left. The shot slowly and subtly zooms in, causing the immense storm system to gradually enlarge and appear to advance within the frame.",
