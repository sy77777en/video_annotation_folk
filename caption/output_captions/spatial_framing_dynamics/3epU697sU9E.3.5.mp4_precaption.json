    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with an abstract, close-up view of white and dark lines on a brown surface. As the camera pans and moves, these lines are revealed to be the markings of an airport taxiway system seen from an aerial perspective. A white and light blue passenger airplane then appears, stationary on the ground, with engines mounted under its wings, casting a dark shadow on the taxiways below it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A high-angle shot pans and moves from a close-up of muted beige and brown surfaces, revealing a stylized, minimalist model of an airport. The ground is marked with clean white, yellow, and dark lines that define the intricate network of runways and taxiways. A small, white and blue airplane rests on one of the taxiways, casting a dark shadow onto the geometric layout below. The entire scene is evenly lit, creating a clean and schematic representation of the airport environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a wide shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an extreme close-up on abstract, out-of-focus lines and shapes that fill the frame. The camera then pulls back and pans, revealing these elements to be the markings of an airport taxiway system in a wide, high-angle shot. As the camera settles, a passenger airplane is revealed in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on the taxiway. The intricate network of taxiways extends across the entire frame, with the airplane casting a distinct shadow directly beneath it. The camera remains positioned high above the subject, looking down on the scene.",
