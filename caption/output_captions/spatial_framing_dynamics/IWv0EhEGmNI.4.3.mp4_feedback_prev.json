    "pre_caption": "The video is presented in a first-person perspective with a night vision effect, giving a green tint to the scene. Initially, the view is focused on a hand wearing tactical gloves, positioned in the center of the frame, gripping a horizontal cylindrical object, likely a railing, in the foreground. The textured wall of the building is visible on the left side in the background. As the scene progresses, the perspective shifts to a rooftop environment. The camera moves forward, revealing the rooftop's dark, rectangular tiles in the foreground, with the rifle and scope visible at the bottom center. The outlines of other buildings are faintly visible in the background on the left and right sides. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent height relative to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a scene with a night vision effect, casting a green tint over everything. A person wearing tactical gloves is seen climbing an exterior staircase of a building and then ascending to the rooftop, where they retrieve a rifle. The presence of firearms and night vision equipment suggests a military or covert operation, likely within a first-person shooter game. The setting appears to be an industrial or urban environment, with textured walls and rooftops visible. The atmosphere is tense, with the person seemingly on a mission, as indicated by the dialogue about checking a fusebox.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, navigates a dark environment under a green night-vision filter. The scene begins with the character climbing an outdoor staircase of a building, with the rough, speckled surface being the building's wall and the long, horizontal cylindrical object above it being the staircase itself. The character then moves onto a tiled rooftop at night, where the outlines of other buildings can be seen in the distance on the left and right sides of the frame. The rooftop features rows of dark, rectangular, overlapping tiles. A rifle with a scope is visible in the lower portion of the view. Overlays include subtitles at the bottom: \"Al-Qatala Fighter 2: Power's out. I'm going to check the fusebox.\" A HUD is also present, displaying a vertical numerical bar on the left and weapon and ammunition indicators on the bottom right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
