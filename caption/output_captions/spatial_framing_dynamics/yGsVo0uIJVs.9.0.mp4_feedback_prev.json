    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium full shot of a low-poly human figure, positioned in the foreground, moving from the left to the right of the frame. The figure is centrally located horizontally and occupies the lower half of the frame vertically. It holds a book or folder in its left hand and a briefcase in its right hand. As the figure walks, it passes in front of a wooden desk with metal legs, which is situated in the middle ground, slightly to the right. The desk is organized with a blue pen holder, a black desk lamp, and scattered papers. Behind the desk, a black office chair is visible, positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right. In the background, filing cabinets are visible on the right side of the frame. The scene is illuminated by light streaming through a window on the left, casting shadows on the floor. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective as the figure moves across the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a low-poly, faceted human figure with a geometric design, resembling a man, visible only from the neck down. The figure is depicted in shades of gray, giving it a monochromatic appearance. It is walking while holding a book or folder in its left hand and carrying a briefcase in its right hand. The figure appears to be moving in front of a wooden desk with metal legs. The desk is organized with a blue container holding writing utensils, a classic black desk lamp, and a few scattered papers. A standard black, mobile office chair is positioned behind the desk, and a set of filing cabinets is visible nearby. The scene is illuminated by light streaming through a window, casting distinct shadows on the floor.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit office, featuring a wooden desk with a metal frame, cluttered with a few items like a blue pen holder and a vintage-style desk lamp. The environment is characterized by a minimalist design with a monochromatic color scheme. A filing cabinet with several binders is positioned against the wall, adding to the office ambiance. A mobile office chair is behind the desk, and another chair is in the corner of the office, accompanied by a painting on the wall. The floor is smooth, and the lighting creates distinct shadows, suggesting a light source from a window. A low-poly figure, resembling a person, is present, holding a dark object and moving through the space. Overlays include a small, unobtrusive icon and the text \"[14]\" in the lower left corner, which do not interfere with the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
