    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with a light skin tone is dressed entirely in black, wearing a hooded garment that covers their head, making it difficult to determine their hair length or color. The garment, which appears to be a loose-fitting cloak or robe, conceals the lower half of their face, leaving only their dark eyes visible. Initially, they maintain a direct gaze, but then their eyes shift to glance left and right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A figure in a dark, hooded garment walks through a long, narrow corridor illuminated entirely by a saturated red light. The walls on both sides are covered in a repeating pattern of textured, recessed squares. Numerous vertical, glowing red light strips are embedded at intervals along the walls, accentuating the length of the hallway as the person moves forward.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a person is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground of a long, red-lit corridor. The corridor's walls, featuring vertical red light strips, extend from the foreground to the background on the left and right sides of the frame, creating a sense of depth. As the person walks forward from the middle ground toward the foreground, the camera simultaneously tracks backward, keeping the subject centered and maintaining the medium shot framing throughout the clip. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
