    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle close-up shot, a hand holding a remote is initially positioned in the bottom center foreground. A coiled LED rope light occupies the middle ground, spread across the center and top of the frame on a dark surface that serves as the background. The camera then pans slightly up and to the right, causing the hand and remote to exit the frame, leaving only the light in the center. The hand and remote re-enter the shot at the bottom left foreground before the hand moves from the foreground into the middle ground, positioning itself in the center of the frame to touch and move a section of the glowing light strip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person's light-skinned hand holds a small, white, rectangular remote control with multiple colored and labeled buttons. The hand's thumb presses various buttons, controlling a long, flexible, white LED neon rope light that is coiled in a tangled pile. The light strip glows brightly, and its color changes in response to the remote, shifting from purple to green, then to blue, and finally to a reddish-orange. The hand is also shown touching and moving a section of the glowing light strip.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark room, a long, flexible, white LED rope light is coiled in a messy pile on a dark, flat surface. A hand holds a small, white remote control with multi-colored buttons, changing the color of the light. The rope cycles through vibrant hues, including a deep purple, a bright green, a cool blue, and a warm reddish-orange, casting a colorful glow on the surface and the hand. The hand also reaches out to touch and rearrange the glowing coils.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
