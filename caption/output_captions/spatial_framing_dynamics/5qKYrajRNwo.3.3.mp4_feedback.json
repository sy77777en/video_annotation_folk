    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot filmed from a high angle, a hand is initially positioned in the top center foreground, reaching down toward a small gold clock resting on a red cloth in the center middle ground. In the out-of-focus background, a framed photograph is positioned in the top left, with other cluttered items visible on the right. A second hand enters from the left, and together the hands lift the clock and cloth, bringing them into the center foreground. The hands then fold the cloth around the clock, holding the resulting red bundle in the center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pair of light-skinned hands, resembling those of a puppet, carefully wraps a small, round, gold-colored clock in a piece of red, textured cloth. The clock has a white face with Roman numerals, black hands, and a cracked glass cover; the letters \"BIJ\" and the word \"QUARTZ\" are visible on the dial. The hands fold the red cloth around the clock, creating a small bundle. In the blurred background, a framed photograph of several people and items of clothing are visible, seemingly located in a drawer.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Above a dark, cluttered drawer, a pair of hands carefully wraps a small, gold-colored clock in a piece of worn red cloth. The clock has a white face with Roman numerals and a cracked glass cover. In the background, a blurry, framed family photograph rests among other indistinct items, including a piece of green and gold fabric. The hands finish by pushing the red bundle into the drawer.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
