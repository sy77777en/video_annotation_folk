    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black cloth is pulled away to reveal a large, intricate, circular sculpture in a dark, dusty room. The sculpture is composed of dark, thorny, vine-like tendrils that form a complex, web-like structure. At its center is a large, shattered, reflective surface resembling a broken mirror. Arranged around the circumference of this central piece are several small, rectangular, black-and-white photographs. The entire apparatus is illuminated by a spotlight from above, and chains of small objects hang on the side of the sculpture. At the base of the sculpture, more of the dark, thorny vines are tangled around a small, mechanical device with visible gears. To the left on the floor, a pale object rests among the vines.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, cavernous room illuminated by a single overhead light, a large, ornate, circular structure stands in the center. This object, resembling a shattered clock or wheel, is constructed from dark, thorny, metallic-looking material with intricate patterns and a fractured, mirror-like surface. Small, rectangular frames holding black-and-white photographs are positioned around its circumference. Small objects hang on the vines, adding to the mysterious atmosphere. In the foreground, a large, dark cloth is being pulled away, gradually revealing the complex structure.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The shot begins with a large, dark cloth in the foreground, obscuring most of the frame except for the top of a circular object in the background center. The cloth is then pulled away toward the left, transitioning the view into a full shot that reveals a large, intricate sculpture. In the final composition, the sculpture is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. A pale object rests in the bottom left foreground among dark, tangled vines that spread across the bottom of the frame. Small, bright particles float throughout the scene, from the foreground to the background. The camera remains positioned at the subject's level.",
