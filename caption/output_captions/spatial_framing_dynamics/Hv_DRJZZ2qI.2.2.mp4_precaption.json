    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a man riding a mountain bike down a steep, reddish-brown, rocky hillside. He is wearing a bright yellow-green cycling outfit, which includes a matching top and pants, along with a black full-face helmet and protective gear covering his face. He is seen navigating the treacherous terrain, including making a jump from a higher ledge down to a lower dirt path. Positioned on a rocky outcrop below the biker's path is a group of spectators, mostly men in casual attire such as t-shirts and shorts. Some of these individuals are standing while others are sitting, and several are holding cameras, appearing to be filming or photographing the biker. Also visible near the spectators are a tall blue flag with a Red Bull logo and three smaller black flags featuring a white circular emblem.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a rugged, arid canyon, a mountain biker in a bright green and yellow outfit descends a steep, narrow, and rough dirt line etched into the reddish-brown slope. The dry landscape is dotted with sparse bushes, and dust kicks up from the bike's wheels as it navigates the incline. Positioned on a rocky ledge below the trail, a group of spectators and photographers observe the descent. A tall blue flag featuring the Red Bull logo, along with three smaller black flags displaying the same white circular emblem, are planted along the hillside.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a mountain biker is initially positioned in the top center of the frame, in the background on a high, reddish-brown ridge. Below, in the middle ground, a group of spectators is gathered on a rocky ledge that extends from the bottom left toward the center. A tall blue flag is visible in the middle ground, left of center, with several smaller black flags also positioned in the middle ground near the spectators and in the bottom left. The biker descends diagonally from the top center toward the right, jumping from the background ridge down to the middle ground path. He lands near the center of the frame and continues riding from right to left, passing the spectators on the ledge. The camera is initially positioned below the biker and transitions to being at his level as he lands on the lower path in the middle ground.",
