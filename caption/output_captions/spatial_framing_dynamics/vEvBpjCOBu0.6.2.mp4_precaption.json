    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a partially visible faucet in the immediate foreground, which moves out of the frame as the camera shifts. In the foreground, a white rack holds several clear glass graduated cylinders and test tubes; one contains a vibrant blue liquid, while the others are empty. Initially positioned centrally, but later moving out of the frame from the bottom, is a clear rectangular tank filled with liquid that refracts light, creating a rainbow effect. A partially visible humanoid figure, clad in a white protective suit with a light blue mask covering part of their face, is seen handling a clear glass beaker, which is actually empty. To the left is a large, cylindrical metal container with a mottled silver texture and a black perforated nozzle. A flexible, reddish-brown tube is also visible in the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A complex arrangement of laboratory equipment is set against a solid black background. The scene features numerous clear glass beakers, graduated cylinders, and test tubes held in place by metal stands and clamps. One cylinder contains a blue liquid, while others contain red or green liquids or are empty. A green clamp, resembling a humanoid hand, holds a clear glass beaker above a clear rectangular tank filled with liquid, which refracts light into a rainbow spectrum. Initially, a worn, perforated metal instrument is positioned at the top of the frame, but it later moves out of the frame as the camera moves and tilts while shifting focus across the intricate setup. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"[23]\" in white.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video depicts a room that resembles a chemical laboratory. As the camera moves forward, it reveals various containers filled with chemical substances and other chemical tools. Then, it shows a humanoid figure using a green metal support to hold a glass cup, with only part of their head and arms visible. Toward the end, the camera keeps moving forward, leaving only the glass cup held by a metal support in the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a laboratory setup. In the foreground, a white rack with graduated cylinders and test tubes occupies the bottom left and center, while a partially visible faucet is at the top right. A large, cylindrical metal container is in the top-left middle ground, with a partially visible humanoid figure to its right. The camera, initially at the subject's level, moves forward and tilts upward, transitioning to a low-angle perspective. During this movement, the foreground rack and the top-right faucet exit the frame from the bottom and top, respectively. The final shot is a close-up focusing on a clear glass beaker held by a green clamp, which is now centered. The humanoid figure remains partially visible on the left, and a reddish-brown tube is now visible in the right background.",
