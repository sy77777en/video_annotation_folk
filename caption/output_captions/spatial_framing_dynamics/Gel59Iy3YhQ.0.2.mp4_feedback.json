    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot from a high-angle, top-down perspective, an orange, amorphous figure is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground. The scene is framed by dark, tall walls that form a narrow corridor. In the top left, a white, curved object with red splatters is situated near the left wall, while a gray block rests against the right wall in the bottom right, both in the middle ground. As the video progresses, the camera follows the central orange figure as it moves forward through the maze-like corridor. Consequently, the surrounding walls and the static white and gray objects scroll past and exit the frame, while new sections of the corridor enter the view, maintaining the central figure's position within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two abstract subjects. The central subject is a bright orange, amorphous figure that appears to be a cluster of particles or a fluid mass. Its shape is inconsistent, though it occasionally takes on a vaguely humanoid form. Another subject is a curved, white object, similar in shape to a crescent or a segment of a circle. This white shape is marked with red splatters that resemble blood, which also appear as a spray of particles near it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, the camera is placed directly above the character and looks down on them as they navigate a dark, abstract environment. The setting consists of a narrow, maze-like corridor with tall, black, textured walls and a solid dark gray-teal floor. An orange, particle-based shape moves forward through the center of the path. To the left, a white, curved object is positioned near a wall marked with red splatters, while a simple, light gray rectangular block is visible on the right. The camera follows the central shape's progression through the angular passages.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
