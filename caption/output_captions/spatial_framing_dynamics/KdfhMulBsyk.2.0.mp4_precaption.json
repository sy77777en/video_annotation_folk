    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit, crowded setting, three men are featured. Initially, a man wearing a black coat, white collared shirt, and black hat appears on the left. He pats the shoulder of a man in a grey suit, who maintains a serious expression and wears a dark fedora, a white collared shirt, and a dark, solid-colored tie. The first man then moves behind him. Subsequently, another man with glasses, a smiling expression, and a patterned tie enters the frame and engages in conversation with the man in the grey suit on the right. Several other indistinct figures, appearing to be men in hats and suits, are visible in the dark background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors at night, in what appears to be a crowded public space. The environment is dark, with indistinct, blurred lights visible in the distant background, suggesting a city street or an event. The overall atmosphere is dimly lit, with the focus on the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects. Initially, a man in a black hat is positioned in the left foreground, looking towards a second man in a grey suit and dark fedora, who occupies the right foreground and faces slightly left. The first man then moves from the left foreground to the left middle ground, passing behind the second man. Subsequently, a third man with glasses enters from the left, occupying the left foreground and engaging with the second man, who remains in the right foreground, now facing left towards the third man. The first man is now visible in the left middle ground, partially behind the third man. Indistinct figures are present in the dark background throughout the scene. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
