    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A stylized, 3D rendering of the upper portion of a toilet is centered at the bottom of the frame against a black background. The toilet is dark and semi-translucent with a subtle blue glow emanating from its base, and its open, rounded lid is positioned in front of the water tank. Above the toilet, a small, grey, rectangular plate appears, from which six thin, colored wires descend vertically. This plate contains two circular, grey buttons: a large one and a smaller one. Under the large button, there are four wires: red, blue, green, and yellow. Under the smaller button, there are two wires: yellow and blue.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a solid black background, a dark, smooth, rounded object with a subtle blue glow at its base is positioned in the lower center. An animated overlay descends from the top, revealing a gray rectangular plate with two circular buttons of different sizes. Six thin, colored wires\u2014red, blue, green, and yellow\u2014extend from the back of the water tank to the central plate. The scene is minimalist and rendered in a 3D animation style.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows the upper part of what appears to be a toilet, with part of the water tank and toilet lid visible, occupying 40% of the frame's width and 50% of the frame's height. As the video progresses, wires and what seems to be the flush button appear above it.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot centers on the upper portion of a toilet, which occupies the bottom half of the frame in the foreground. The camera remains static and at the subject's level. From the top of the frame, a small, grey rectangular plate descends and stops in the top center, positioned in the middle ground just above the toilet. This plate contains a large circular button on its left and a smaller one on its right. Six thin, colored wires extend vertically downwards from the plate, connecting to the top of the toilet tank in the foreground.",
