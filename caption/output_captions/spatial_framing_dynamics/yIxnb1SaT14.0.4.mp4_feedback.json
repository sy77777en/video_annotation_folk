    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of a city scene. The illuminated Palais Garnier is positioned in the background at the center of the frame. It is framed on the left and right by large buildings that extend from the middle ground into the background. The bottom half of the frame is occupied by heavy traffic in the foreground and middle ground. A large tour bus is prominent on the right side of the foreground, with another partially visible on the left.

There are no changes in shot size or camera position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a bustling Parisian avenue at night, with the grand, illuminated Palais Garnier opera house serving as the central focal point at the end of the street. The ornate building features a large green dome topped with a statue, flanked by golden figures, all brightly lit against the dark sky. The scene is filled with the heavy, flowing traffic of cars and large tour buses, their red and white lights creating streaks of motion that convey a sense of vibrant energy. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to emphasize the magnificent scale of the architecture and the lively atmosphere of the city, rather than any single person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a nighttime scene on a wide avenue in Paris, looking towards the illuminated Palais Garnier. The ornate opera house, with its green dome, golden statues, and grand facade, is brightly lit with warm, yellow light. Flanking the avenue are multi-story Haussmann-style buildings with lit windows. On the right, a building features a prominent illuminated sign for \"BERLI\". The street is filled with dense, fast-moving traffic, including cars and tour buses, whose headlights and taillights create streaks of white and red light in a time-lapse effect. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIC CINEMATOGRAPHER\" in white.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
