    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a middle-aged man with a light skin tone and a short beard. He is wearing a light-colored cap and a dark, loose-fitting shirt over a yellow long-sleeve shirt. The man is raising his right arm while tilting his head slightly to the left, and his expression appears focused and engaged. He is looking in a direction that suggests he is interacting with something or someone off-screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting in a mountainous region, characterized by rugged terrain and distant peaks under a cloudy sky. The environment suggests a cool, overcast day, with muted natural colors dominating the scene. The landscape features rolling hills and valleys, providing a sense of vastness and isolation. The focus is on a person positioned prominently in the foreground, wearing a light-colored cap and layered clothing, which includes a dark shirt with a yellow undershirt. The person's posture and expression suggest engagement with the surroundings. The overall atmosphere is serene and contemplative, with the natural backdrop providing a dramatic contrast to the human presence.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a man, capturing him from the chest up. Positioned in the foreground and centered in the frame, the man occupies the middle of the image. His raised right arm extends towards the top left corner, while his head is slightly tilted to the left. The background consists of a mountainous landscape, situated in the middle ground and extending into the distance, creating depth. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the subject within the frame. The man's interaction seems directed towards something outside the frame, emphasizing his engagement with the unseen environment. The camera angle and framing keep the focus firmly on the man against the expansive backdrop.",
