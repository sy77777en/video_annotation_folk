    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a small, light brown tabby kitten with distinct dark stripes and a soft, short coat. The kitten is resting on a flat, black surface, possibly a cushion or bag. It briefly opens its eyes before closing them again and stretches its claws while extending its body, suggesting a moment of wakefulness before returning to rest. Its ears are pointed and upright, and its front paw is extended forward, relaxed over the edge of the surface. The kitten's head is slightly tilted, and its whiskers are visible against its face, adding to its serene appearance. The overall posture and expression convey a sense of calm and restfulness.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting with a small, striped kitten resting on a black, textured surface, possibly a suitcase. The environment is softly lit, suggesting a calm, quiet atmosphere. The background features blurred, muted colors, indicating walls or furniture, but lacks distinct details. The kitten's fur is a mix of gray and black stripes, adding a natural pattern to the scene. The overall composition conveys a sense of tranquility and stillness, with the kitten's relaxed posture as the central focus.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a small tabby kitten, capturing its upper body and head prominently in the frame. The kitten occupies the center of the image, with its head positioned slightly towards the top right. It rests on a flat, black surface located in the foreground. The kitten's front paw extends forward, hanging off the edge of the surface. Throughout the video, the kitten remains mostly stationary, with minimal movement involving slight shifts in its head position and brief openings of its eyes. The background is softly blurred, featuring muted colors that suggest an indoor setting with walls or furniture, but these elements remain out of focus. The camera maintains a steady position at the kitten's level, ensuring the subject remains the focal point throughout the sequence. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the kitten within the frame.",
