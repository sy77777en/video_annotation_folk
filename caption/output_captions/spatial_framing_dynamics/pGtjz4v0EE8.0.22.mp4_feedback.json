    "pre_caption": "This is a static extreme wide shot of a scenic landscape. A historic town with prominent towers is positioned in the center of the frame, situated in the background atop a hill. The foreground and middle ground are filled with rolling green hills and vineyards, which occupy the bottom half of the frame, with distinct rows of vineyards visible in the bottom left. The top portion of the frame is occupied by a blue sky with clouds, which serves as the background for the town's skyline. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking across the landscape toward the town.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot, capturing a picturesque view of the Italian countryside. Rolling green hills, patterned with what appear to be vineyards and dotted with lush trees, seamlessly extend from the foreground into the distant background under a vast blue sky with scattered white clouds. Perched atop a distant hill is a historic walled town, its skyline uniquely defined by a cluster of tall, slender stone towers. There is no single main subject, as the composition is designed to convey the expansive scale and tranquil atmosphere of the entire scene, emphasizing the harmonious relationship between the natural landscape and the ancient settlement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An extreme wide shot captures a historic town perched atop a hill, surrounded by a lush, green landscape. The town is characterized by numerous tall, square stone towers that create a distinct skyline against a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The rolling hills extend from the foreground into the background, covered in fields, some of which are organized into the neat rows of vineyards, interspersed with patches of trees. The scene is set during a clear, sunny day.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
