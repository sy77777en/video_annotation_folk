    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light gray, ceramic planter is shaped to resemble a stylized human face with a prominent nose and closed, curved lines for eyes. A pair of black, round-framed glasses rests on the planter's nose. Sprouting from the top of the planter is a dense cluster of vibrant green, spiky, grass-like foliage.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene features a light gray, cylindrical planter designed to look like a face with closed eyes and a nose. A pair of black, round-framed glasses sits on the planter's face, and vibrant green, grass-like artificial foliage sprouts from the top. The planter is placed on a glossy surface with a gray and black swirled pattern. In the blurred background, a white curtain and a red object are visible. The camera slowly moves backward while zooming in on the planter.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot begins with a face-shaped planter centered in the middle ground, resting on a glossy, patterned surface that fills the foreground. The camera is positioned at the planter's level. In the background, a red object is visible to the left, and a white curtain hangs behind it. Throughout the video, the camera slowly pulls backward while simultaneously zooming in on the planter. This dolly zoom effect keeps the planter consistently centered and sized within the frame, while the background appears to compress, causing the red object and the curtain to move closer and become larger and more prominent.",
