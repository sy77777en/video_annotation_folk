    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a traditional Japanese garden, capturing a tranquil pond in the foreground, with meticulously arranged rocks and vibrant autumn foliage surrounding it. The pond is positioned centrally, reflecting the partly cloudy sky above. To the left, a stone lantern stands near the water's edge, adding a classical touch. The garden's lush greenery, including trees with red and green leaves, occupies the middle ground, while a stone pathway meanders alongside the pond on the right. In the background, modern buildings rise above the treetops, creating a contrast between nature and urban architecture. The camera is positioned at a height that aligns with the garden's elements, providing a balanced view of the serene landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a serene and picturesque scene of a traditional Japanese garden during what appears to be late afternoon, as indicated by the warm, golden light casting long shadows across the landscape. The focal point is a tranquil pond, surrounded by meticulously arranged rocks and vibrant autumn foliage, including trees with leaves in shades of red, orange, and green. A stone lantern stands near the water's edge, adding to the classical aesthetic. In the background, modern buildings contrast with the natural beauty of the garden, creating a harmonious blend of tradition and contemporary architecture. The sky is partly cloudy, with soft, diffused sunlight filtering through, enhancing the reflective surface of the pond and casting a peaceful ambiance over the entire scene. There is no main subject in the video; instead, the focus is on the environment, capturing the tranquil atmosphere and the interplay of light, color, and reflection that define this beautiful setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a serene outdoor setting in a Japanese garden during the late afternoon, viewed from a first-person perspective. The scene features a tranquil pond reflecting the sky, with scattered clouds tinged by the warm glow of the setting sun. Surrounding the water are meticulously arranged rocks and lush greenery, including vibrant red and green trees that add a splash of color to the landscape. A stone pathway meanders alongside the pond, bordered by well-maintained shrubs and a traditional stone lantern. In the distance, modern buildings rise above the treetops, their facades illuminated by the golden light. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, with the natural beauty of the garden harmoniously blending with the urban skyline.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
