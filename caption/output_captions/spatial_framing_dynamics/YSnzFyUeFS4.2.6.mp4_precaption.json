    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a first-person view of a pair of light-skinned hands holding and adjusting a black camera with a visible lens and controls. The camera is directed at a sunlit city sidewalk where several individuals are present. A man with short, dark-colored hair, wearing a white tank top and dark pants, walks towards the viewpoint. A woman with light-colored hair, dressed in a grey top and dark pants, carrying a shoulder bag, walks in the opposite direction and is seen only from the back as she moves along the sidewalk. In the center-left of the screen, another man with dark hair, wearing a black t-shirt and dark shorts, stands near a parked white sedan. Storefronts, including one with a sign for \"Artistic PIZZA\" and another for \"ACE Hardware Benjamin Moore\", line the street, with long shadows cast by the bright sunlight.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a sun-drenched city street. Long shadows stretch across the sidewalk where several pedestrians are walking. On the left, a white car is parked along the curb. To the right, storefronts line the street, including one with a sign for \"Artistic PIZZA\" and another displaying \"OPEN\" with food advertisements. Brick buildings with fire escapes rise on both sides of the street, and trees provide some shade. In the foreground, a pair of hands holds and adjusts a camera, with its lens visible, framing the street scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a street-level perspective: a white car is parked in the left middle ground, one man stands in the center-left middle ground, another man walks from the center middle ground towards the viewpoint, and a woman walks away in the right middle ground, with storefronts lining the right side of the street. The framing then incorporates a first-person view, as hands holding a black camera enter the extreme foreground, occupying the lower half of the screen. The camera's lens is positioned in the bottom-center foreground, pointed at the street, and its active LCD screen is also in the foreground, displaying the same scene. The original street scene is now primarily visible in the upper half of the frame and on the LCD. While the hands adjust the camera, the man who was approaching continues to move towards the center of this now more distant street view, and the woman moves further into the right background. The camera is maintained at an eye-level, first-person perspective throughout.",
