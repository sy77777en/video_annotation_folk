    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a low-angle perspective, a large, yellow rubber duck with a smooth surface is visible. The duck, which fills most of the view, has a wide, open orange beak and simple, round eyes with black pupils and white sclerae. It is situated within a white, tiled, rectangular space recessed into the wall.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, is set from a low angle inside a white-tiled structure resembling a corridor filled with water. A large, yellow rubber duck with a red-orange beak and wide eyes is positioned in the center, looming over the viewer's perspective. The walls are covered in a grid of small, white, glossy tiles, and a single, small, circular light is visible on the ceiling above. The perspective shifts slightly, making the duck appear to move closer and fill more of the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "From a low-angle, full shot, a large yellow rubber duck is positioned in the center of the frame, situated in the middle ground within a white-tiled recess. A single circular light is visible in the top center background on the ceiling. The camera, positioned below the subject, moves forward and slightly upward. This movement causes the duck to loom larger, with its body eventually filling the entire bottom half of the frame, while its head and open beak occupy the top center, dominating the view.",
