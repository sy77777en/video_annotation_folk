    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, where a silhouetted figure is thrown from the right side of the frame toward the left foreground. In the background, a large screen displaying a luminous blue-green jellyfish occupies the center and right of the frame. As the first figure falls out of view toward the bottom, a second silhouetted figure moves from the right to the center foreground. The camera, initially at the subjects' level, follows this second figure forward and tilts down, transitioning to a high-angle perspective. In the final framing, the back of the second person's head occupies the bottom foreground, looking down. The first person is visible below in the middle ground, lying on a ledge. The background reveals a deep, vertical shaft between buildings, with distant city lights visible, emphasizing the height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two people engaged in a physical altercation, both presented primarily as dark silhouettes. The first individual, dressed in dark attire, is thrown and ends up hanging in mid-air, face down, on an exterior ledge of a tall building. The second person, who has short, light-colored hair and also wears dark clothing, is seen standing inside, looking down from above at the person on the ledge.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at night within a dark, modern interior defined by large, vertical screens. These screens display a luminous, blue-green jellyfish with a distinct bell and long, flowing tentacles against a dark blue, particle-filled background. A silhouetted figure moves in front of these glowing displays. The surrounding structure is dark and metallic, and glimpses of distant city lights are visible through gaps. The perspective shifts to look down a long, narrow, vertical shaft lined with glowing blue and green lights, suggesting a great height.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows two people fighting in a high-rise building. It begins with a medium shot of the two fighting, with jellyfish footage playing on a large screen in the background. One person knocks the other down, and the fallen person drops outside the building. As the camera moves forward, the angle shifts from level to high, revealing the back of one person's head in the foreground and the body of the other person hanging outside the building. The background shows other high-rise buildings, highlighting the great height of the scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to above the subject.",
