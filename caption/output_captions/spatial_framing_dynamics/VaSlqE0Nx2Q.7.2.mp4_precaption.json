    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young boy with light skin walks through a wooded area. He is dressed in what appears to be early 20th-century attire, consisting of a dark, single-breasted jacket, dark knickerbockers, light-colored knee-high socks, dark boots, and a dark flat cap on his head. He navigates through a forest of tall, thin trees, passing a large fallen tree on the ground. A thin white string is tied between the standing trees, and the boy walks alongside it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a black-and-white scene set in a pine forest, a young boy walks across uneven, grassy terrain. Tall, slender pine trees stand in rows, with a thin white string stretched between several of them. A large, fallen tree with tangled branches lies horizontally in the foreground. The camera pans slightly to follow the boy as he navigates through the wooded landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot opens on a forest scene with a large fallen tree in the left foreground and standing trees in the middle ground and background. A young boy enters from the right middle ground and walks towards the center of the frame, moving alongside a thin white string stretched between the trees. The camera pans left to follow him, keeping him positioned in the center middle ground as he navigates the grassy terrain. The camera is positioned at the boy's level.",
