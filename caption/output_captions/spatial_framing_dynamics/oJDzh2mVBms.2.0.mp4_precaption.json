    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a time-lapse landscape scenery shot capturing the progression of dawn over a vast, snow-covered environment. The scene begins in the deep blue of twilight, with the sky gradually lightening as warm orange and pink tones appear on the horizon, backlighting a distant, dark line of evergreen trees. Wispy clouds drift across the expansive sky, catching the emerging sunlight. In the foreground, a wide, flat field of pristine white snow stretches out, with two simple, light-colored, boxy buildings nestled in snowdrifts on the left. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the atmospheric transformation and the immense scale of the cold landscape, focusing on the changing light and the serene, stark beauty of the setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A timelapse captures a snowy landscape during the blue hour of twilight. The sky is a deep, dark blue that fades into lighter shades of blue, pink, and orange along the horizon, where a line of dark, dense forest stands. Wispy clouds drift across the sky, their colors shifting with the fading light. A vast, flat field completely covered in white snow extends across both the foreground and middle ground of the scene. To the left, two light-colored, geometric buildings are situated in the snow, with light visible through a few small windows on one of them.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a snowy landscape. The composition is divided horizontally, with the expansive sky occupying the upper two-thirds of the frame and the snow-covered ground filling the bottom third. In the middle ground, on the bottom left of the frame, two light-colored buildings are visible. A dark treeline stretches across the background along the horizon, from the center to the right side of the frame. The foreground consists of a wide, flat field of snow. The camera is positioned at a level height, capturing the scene from a fixed perspective. The only spatial change is the time-lapsed movement of clouds, which drift across the sky from left to right.",
