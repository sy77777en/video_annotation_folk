    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Five light-skinned men stand in a police lineup. The man on the far left has dark, receding hair, a short dark beard, and wears a grey bomber jacket with \"PORSCHE\" on the sleeve over a dark top and brown trousers, looking slightly to his right with hands clasped. Next to him, a man with short light brown hair and a beard wears a long black leather coat over a black turtleneck, looking forward with hands clasped. The man in the center has short dark hair and is clean-shaven; he wears a black suit jacket over an open bright red shirt and black trousers, holding a small yellow paper and gesturing as he speaks. After he finishes speaking, he hands the yellow paper to the man on his right, who has short dark wavy hair, is clean-shaven, and wears a light blue collared shirt with a loosened patterned tie and light beige trousers, holding a beige jacket over his arm. This man reads the note aloud and then passes it to the man on the far right. The man on the far right has a high hairline with dark hair on the sides, is clean-shaven, and wears a light pink patterned shirt under a blue denim vest and dark grey trousers. He first looks forward, then looks down when the yellow paper is handed to him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be a police lineup room. The background is a plain white wall marked with horizontal black lines and black height measurements in feet and inches, ranging from 3'0\" to 6'6\". There is no discernible furniture or other props in the immediate vicinity, creating a stark and functional environment. The lighting is even and bright, typical of an indoor setting. The subjects stand relatively still, with some minor shifts in posture and gestures.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium full shot of five men standing in a horizontal line in the middle ground, against a white background wall marked with black horizontal lines and height measurements. From left to right: the first man is positioned on the left side of the frame, looking slightly to his right with hands clasped. The second man stands to his right, looking forward with hands clasped. The man in the center holds a small yellow paper, gestures while speaking, and then hands the paper to the fourth man, positioned to his right. This fourth man, holding a beige jacket over his arm, reads from the paper and subsequently passes it to the fifth man on the far right of the frame. The fifth man, initially looking forward, then looks down at the paper. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the scene.",
