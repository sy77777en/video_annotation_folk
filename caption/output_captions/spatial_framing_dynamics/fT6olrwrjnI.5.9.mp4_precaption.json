    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases an animated figure wearing a black and white striped sports jersey with the number 18. He has short, dark hair and a determined expression. His eyes are glowing red, and red, vein-like energy surrounds him, highlighting his intense focus and power. The character is depicted in motion, possibly running or charging forward, with his fists clenched and arms bent.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an intense scene featuring a character in a dynamic pose, set against a stark, minimalistic background. The environment is undefined, with a focus on the character who is wearing a black and white sports uniform with the number 18. Red, lightning-like energy surrounds the character, adding a sense of motion and intensity. The character's expression and posture suggest action, with the red energy providing a vivid contrast to the otherwise monochrome setting. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, emphasizing the character's centrality and the dramatic visual elements.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of an animated figure in a black and white striped sports jersey with the number 18. The subject occupies the central area of the frame throughout, positioned in the foreground. Initially, the character is slightly angled towards the left side of the frame, with their body oriented diagonally. As the video progresses, the character shifts to face more directly towards the viewer, maintaining a central 2D position. The red, vein-like energy surrounding the character remains consistently in the foreground, enhancing the sense of motion. The background is minimalistic and undefined, ensuring the subject remains the focal point. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subject, capturing the character's upper body and part of their lower body, emphasizing their dynamic pose and clenched fists. There are no significant changes in the camera angle or shot size, keeping the subject's prominence constant.",
