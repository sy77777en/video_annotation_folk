    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A thin, vertical, yellow rectangle is shown, starting center-right and remaining on the right side throughout the video, topped with a small, white, downward-pointing triangle. This yellow shape is surrounded by solid black geometric shapes. A large black structure forms an open frame, with a slightly tilted horizontal edge in the upper part of the video. The yellow shape moves from left to right within this frame. Additionally, several smaller black horizontal rectangles are positioned below the yellow shape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video captures a minimalist, abstract scene against a dark blue, vignetted background. The environment is defined by large, black, angular shapes that form walls and platforms, creating a maze-like structure. Primarily located towards the center-right to right side of the scene, a small, vertical yellow rectangle topped with a white triangle jumps between different platforms. Other black platforms are visible in the space. A small, multi-colored bar is overlaid in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a high-angle, side-view perspective. Initially, a thin, vertical yellow rectangle is positioned in the center-right of the frame, situated in the middle ground on a black platform. A large black structure in the foreground frames the scene from the top and left. The yellow rectangle then jumps upward and moves to the right, with the camera panning to follow its motion, keeping it on the right side of the frame. As the scene scrolls, the initial platform moves off-screen to the left, and other black platforms appear in the middle ground below the yellow rectangle. A small, multi-colored bar is fixed in the bottom right corner as a foreground overlay.",
