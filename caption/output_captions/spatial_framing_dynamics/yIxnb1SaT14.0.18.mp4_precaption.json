    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a vibrant, time-lapse cityscape scenery shot of a bustling Parisian street at night. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject; the time-lapse photography intentionally blurs the pedestrians into streams of motion, emphasizing the dynamic energy of the city itself. The scene is illuminated by the warm, golden glow of ornate buildings, one of which is covered in a dense web of white fairy lights, and the bright lights of a cafe with a prominent red awning. A classic Art Nouveau \"METROPOLITAIN\" metro entrance stands centrally, its green ironwork and glowing sign a key feature. The wet pavement reflects the myriad of colorful lights, creating a glossy, dreamlike quality that enhances the romantic and lively ambiance of the location.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse captures a bustling Parisian street at night, where wet pavement reflects the vibrant city lights. In the center, a classic green Art Nouveau \"Metropolitain\" sign arches over a metro station entrance. To the left, a building with a red-awning cafe is bathed in warm yellow light, while an adjacent building is covered in a dense grid of sparkling white lights. Pedestrians appear as colorful blurs of motion, streaming along the sidewalk past the metro entrance and a modern glass bus shelter on the right. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the name \"MATHIEU STANIC\" with the title \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" beneath it.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static wide shot of a Parisian street scene at night. The focus is on the environment, with pedestrians appearing as blurred streams of motion due to the time-lapse effect. A green Art Nouveau \"Metropolitain\" metro entrance is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. To its left, a building with a red-awning cafe occupies the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. An adjacent building, covered in white lights, is located in the center-left middle ground. On the right side of the frame, a glass bus shelter stands in the middle ground. The wet pavement fills the bottom foreground, and a text overlay is present in the bottom right corner. The camera is positioned at eye level.",
