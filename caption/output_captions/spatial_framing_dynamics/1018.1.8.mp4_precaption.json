    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with fair skin, wearing a red Santa hat, a dark green sweater over a white collared shirt and tie, and dark green trousers, walks down a narrow train corridor. He carries a large, light-colored sack. Ahead of him, another person, seen mostly from the profile and back, wears a green hat, a white short-sleeved shirt, and a dark vest, holding a bundle of branches in his arms. Both individuals walk toward the camera and then turn to their right, disappearing from the left side of the frame, leaving the empty, light-green passageway in view as the lights flicker.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within the long, narrow corridor of a train car, characterized by a uniform pale green color on the walls, doors, and arched ceiling. A patterned walkway extends down the center of the floor. The corridor is lit by long, white light strips running along the ceiling. On one side, a row of windows is covered by light-colored roller blinds, while the other side is lined with closed doors. At the beginning of the sequence, a man in a white shirt and black vest walks toward the camera, then turns to his right and exits the frame on the left side. Following him is another person wearing a Santa hat and carrying a large sack, who also walks toward the camera, turns to his right, and exits the frame on the left, leaving the corridor empty. The environment alternates between bright illumination and near-darkness, with only the ceiling lights remaining visible in the dark, possibly due to the train moving in and out of tunnels.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot from a camera positioned at the subjects' level. A person in a green hat occupies the left foreground, while a man in a Santa hat is positioned in the center middle ground, walking down a train corridor toward the camera. Both individuals move from their initial positions toward the left foreground and exit the frame on the left. After they disappear, the shot becomes a static, wide view of the empty corridor, creating a one-point perspective that extends into the background. The corridor is framed with doors on the left, windows on the right, and a distant door in the center background. The scene's lighting then flickers, alternating between being fully illuminated and nearly dark.",
