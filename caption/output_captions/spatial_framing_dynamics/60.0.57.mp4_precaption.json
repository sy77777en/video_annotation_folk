    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, dark, curly hair and a light-to-medium skin tone sits in the center, leaning forward. She wears a shiny red zip-up jacket over a dark top and is reaching into a large, open black bag in the foreground. Inside the bag, a pair of bright, fluorescent yellow sneakers is visible. A white swoosh logo is superimposed over the center of the scene. On the right of the frame, another woman with light skin and dark hair in a high ponytail sits on a bench, wearing a light blue sports bra, black shorts, white socks, and black sneakers. Further in the background on the left of the frame, two other women with dark hair are seated, both wearing pink shirts.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor locker room features light blue, glossy tiled walls and a wooden bench where several young women are seated. In the foreground, a large black bag is being opened, revealing a pair of bright yellow-green sneakers inside. In the background, clothing and a red backpack are hung on hooks. The scene is illuminated by cool, blue-toned lighting. A white Nike swoosh logo is overlaid in the center of the scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This low-angle shot shows a girl sitting on a chair, taking sneakers out of a bag. The frame is cluttered with multiple human subjects, and the bag in the foreground partially occludes the girl's body. Overall, it appears to capture most of her body in a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a low-angle full shot, a large black bag occupies the bottom foreground, with a pair of yellow sneakers visible inside at the bottom center. A woman in a red jacket is positioned in the center middle ground, leaning forward over the bag. To her right, another woman sits on a bench in the middle ground. A white logo is superimposed over the center of the frame. In the background, two other women are seated on the left, with a locker room wall and a red backpack in the top left background. The camera is positioned below the subjects, looking up.",
