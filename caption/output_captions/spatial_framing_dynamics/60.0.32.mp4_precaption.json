    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and movement** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial composition and motion** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on how much of the subject is visible. For example, *a close-up shot of a human face*, *a medium shot of a man\u2019s lower body*, or *a wide shot of a man standing near the ocean*. If the shot size does not follow a typical framing pattern or changes erratically, describe the overall framing instead, such as *\"The camera tracks a skateboarder in an unsteady manner, mostly capturing the skateboarder\u2019s lower body.\"*  \n\nNext, describe the **subject\u2019s position in the scene**. Indicate their approximate location within the frame, such as *\"The person is in the bottom-left corner of the frame\"* or *\"The person is on the right of the frame.\"* Describe their depth in the scene relative to the **foreground, midground, or background**, such as *\"In the foreground, a person is sitting in front of a computer.\"* Additionally, specify their physical placement within the environment, such as *\"The woman in the midground stands near a window, looking outside.\"*  \n\nFinally, describe the **subject\u2019s height relative to the camera**, if relevant. Indicate whether they are framed at eye level, above, or below the camera\u2019s perspective, such as *\"The man is framed at eye level.\"* or *\"A low-angle shot captures the person from below.\"*\n\nFor **scenery-focused shots without a primary subject**, describe how the scene is framed by detailing its **shot size** and **spatial composition**.  \n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** used to capture the environment, such as *a wide shot of a vast mountain range stretching across the horizon* or *a close-up of raindrops hitting a window*.  \n\nNext, describe the **spatial composition**, including the positioning of key elements within the frame. Indicate where objects appear, such as *a symmetrical shot of a hallway positioned at the center, leading toward a vanishing point* or *a large tree stands in the left-bottom corner*. Incorporate depth by mentioning **foreground, midground, and background** elements when relevant. For instance, *in the foreground, a bicycle is parked against a fence, while in the background, skyscrapers rise against the sky* or *the midground features a river cutting through the landscape*.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes within the frame, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.  \n\nFor **subjects**, indicate how their position and framing evolve. For example, *\"A medium shot of a man\u2019s upper body near a doorway transitions into a close-up of his face as he walks toward the camera.\"* Similarly, describe movement across the frame, such as *\"A cyclist moves from the left to the right side of the frame, maintaining a full shot throughout.\"* If the camera\u2019s perspective changes, specify the shift, like *\"A full-body shot of a child at eye level shifts as the camera tilts upward, reframing them from a low angle looking up.\"*  \n\nFor **scenery shots**, describe how the framing adjusts to reveal different aspects of the environment. For instance, *\"The shot begins with an aerial view of a city skyline, then tilts downward to focus on a busy intersection.\"* If the camera moves through space, specify the transition, such as *\"The camera moves forward, transitioning from a wide view of a dense forest to a close-up of a single tree trunk covered in moss.\"*\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not comprehensively capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference or starting point to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video, but do not rely on them completely. Focus on the subject's **shot size, position, and movement** within the frame. Remember, your goal is to describe the **spatial composition and motion** within the shot.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with dark skin and black hair in a dynamic action pose, wearing a blue soccer jersey with the number 9, white shorts, and red socks. She is captured mid-air in a stadium setting, suggesting she is playing soccer. Her hair is tied back, and she appears to be leaping or kicking. The scene transitions to a cozy bedroom where a framed photo of the same woman in action is placed on a wooden bedside table next to a white lamp. The room is softly lit, with string lights visible in the background, creating a warm and personal atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins in an outdoor stadium during the day, showcasing a soccer player in mid-air against a backdrop of a clear sky and a large, modern stadium filled with spectators. The scene transitions to a cozy bedroom with soft lighting, where a wooden bedside table holds a white lamp, an alarm clock, and a framed photo of the soccer player, linking the two environments. The room is adorned with string lights, a plush toy on the bed, and light green bed sheets, creating a warm and personal atmosphere that enhances the overall aesthetic.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows unknown of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a woman in a dynamic action pose, mid-air in a stadium setting. She is positioned centrally in the frame, with the stadium and spectators forming the background. The camera captures her from a low angle, emphasizing her leap against the clear sky. The scene transitions to a cozy bedroom, where a close-up shot focuses on a wooden bedside table in the foreground. The table holds a framed photo of the woman in action, a white lamp, and an alarm clock. The background features softly lit string lights and a plush toy on a bed with light green sheets, creating a warm atmosphere. The transition links the dynamic outdoor action with the intimate indoor setting.",
