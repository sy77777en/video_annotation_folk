    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a sprawling facility within a vast landscape, captured from a high-angle aerial perspective. A dark fence runs along the bottom edge of the frame in the foreground, enclosing the complex. In the middle ground, a series of large, white, spherical structures are arranged in a row across the bottom half of the frame, with other blocky buildings positioned behind them toward the center. A dark forest extends horizontally across the middle of the scene, separating the facility from the rolling hills that occupy the upper portion of the frame in the background. The hazy, reddish sky fills the top third of the composition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents an architectural rendering scenery shot of a sprawling industrial or scientific facility set within a vast, arid landscape. The focus is on the overall scale and unique design of the complex within its environment, rather than on a specific subject. The facility is characterized by a series of large, white, spherical structures resembling radomes, arranged in a row on reddish-brown earth and enclosed by a dark fence. Behind these prominent domes are various other white, blocky, modern-style buildings. The entire complex is bordered by a dark, dense forest that gives way to rolling, barren hills in the distance, all under a hazy, reddish-pink sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an expansive view of a large, fenced-in complex situated in a remote, arid landscape under a hazy, pink-hued sky. The surrounding area consists of reddish-brown earth, with rolling hills covered in dark forests in the distance. Within the compound, several large, white, spherical domes, resembling oversized golf balls, are arranged in the foreground. These domes sit atop cylindrical bases and are positioned near a collection of low-rise, rectangular, light-gray buildings. A dark, solid fence encloses the entire facility. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text \"[12,14,16];@OpenStreetMap\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
