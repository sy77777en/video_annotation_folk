    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot focused on the back of a woman with shoulder-length brown hair, wearing a teal top, who occupies the foreground and center of the frame. Her position is central in the 2D space and in the foreground in 3D. Behind her, a group of young women stands in a line across the middle ground, spanning from the left to the right side of the frame. They are positioned slightly off-center, with their heads turned to the right, facing the woman in the teal top. The camera captures the upper bodies of the group, indicating a medium shot for them. The background includes the interior of a spacious, well-lit room with white walls and a high ceiling, featuring exposed pipes and fluorescent lights. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a consistent angle throughout the scene. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with shoulder-length brown hair, wearing a teal top, positioned in the foreground with her back to the camera. She appears to be addressing a group of young women in the background. The young women, dressed in various athletic outfits, are lined up with their heads turned to the right, facing the woman in the teal top, while their bodies are oriented towards the wall opposite them. This suggests a setting related to sports or training, with the focus on the interaction between the woman and the group, highlighting the woman as the central figure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting, viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective, focusing on a character's upper body and the scene ahead. The environment appears to be a spacious, well-lit room, possibly a gym or studio, with white walls and a high ceiling featuring exposed pipes and fluorescent lights. The time of day is indeterminate due to the artificial lighting. In the background, a group of people is visible, standing in a line, dressed in casual athletic wear with various colors and patterns. The scene conveys a sense of organized activity or instruction, with the character in the foreground seemingly observing or engaging with the group.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
