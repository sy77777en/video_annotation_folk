    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A metallic, circular cymbal, likely brass, is the primary focus, mounted horizontally. It features a raised central bell and is secured at its center by a light-colored metallic wing nut and a dark felt washer on a stand post. The cymbal's smooth surface reflects the dim, blueish ambient light, resulting in a dark, desaturated golden appearance. In the upper left, a section of another dark, out-of-focus cymbal is visible. Beneath and slightly behind the main cymbal, a portion of another brass cymbal in a light color is discernible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors, likely at dusk or dawn, indicated by the deep blue, low-light conditions. The primary focus is a full shot of a metallic, circular cymbal, part of a drum kit. The cymbal, appearing dark gold or bronze in the dim light, is mounted on a metal stand with visible adjustment hardware at its center. In the upper left corner, a section of another dark, out-of-focus cymbal is visible. Beneath and slightly behind the main cymbal, a portion of another instrument can also be seen. The background is a blurred, indistinct dark blue expanse, suggesting a distant, out-of-focus urban or natural landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot where a primary cymbal is centrally positioned in the frame, occupying the middle ground. Its mounting hardware is also located in the center of the frame, within the middle ground. In the top left, a section of another out-of-focus cymbal is visible, also in the middle ground. Beneath and slightly behind the primary cymbal, a portion of a third cymbal or instrument is discernible in the bottom center, extending towards the bottom right, situated in the middle ground. A blurred, dark blue expanse forms the background, occupying the upper portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the framing remains static.",
