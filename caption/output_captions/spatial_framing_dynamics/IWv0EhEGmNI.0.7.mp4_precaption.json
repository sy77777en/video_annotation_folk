    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a focus on a man with a medium-dark skin tone, a buzz cut, and a short beard, seated in the back seat. He is wearing a light-colored shirt or jacket and is gazing at the man in the driver's seat. The camera then shifts to the driver, who has a lighter skin tone, a thick brown beard, and is wearing a dark knit cap and a dark jacket. He is smoking, with his left hand on the steering wheel, and looking forward. The video highlights the distinct appearances of the two men, with the focus primarily on the driver.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a scene from inside a dimly lit vehicle, likely at night, with rain droplets continuously blanketing the windshield, creating a speckled texture that obscures vision. The windshield wipers oscillate rhythmically, sweeping back and forth, enhancing the sense of a rainy night. The environment is enclosed, with metal grating and dark, utilitarian surfaces forming the backdrop. Two individuals are seated inside the car: one in the back seat on the left and the other in the front driver's seat on the right, both dressed in dark, rugged clothing. The lighting is low and muted, casting soft shadows and emphasizing the subdued atmosphere. An overlay of green and white subtitles appears near the bottom center, displaying the text: \u201cPrice: We\u2019re cleaning up a mess.\u201d The overall scene is quiet and still, with the rain and reflections contributing to a somber, enclosed setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of the man in the back seat, who is positioned on the left side of the frame and in the middle ground of the scene, with the camera at his eye level. The background includes the metal grating and dark surfaces of the vehicle interior, visible behind him. The shot then transitions to a close-up of the driver, who is now the main subject, positioned on the right side of the frame and also in the middle ground, with the camera again at his eye level. The windshield with rain droplets and the wipers moving across it are visible in the background, occupying the upper and central parts of the frame. Throughout the video, the spatial focus shifts from the back seat passenger on the left to the driver on the right, with each subject occupying the center of the frame during their respective close-ups. The subtitles appear near the bottom center of the frame, overlaying the lower part of the scene. There is no significant movement of the subjects themselves, but the camera\u2019s focus and framing shift smoothly from one subject to the other, maintaining a consistent height relative to each subject.",
