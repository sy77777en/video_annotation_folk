    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot that slowly zooms in to a medium shot. Initially, three men in suits are in the left foreground, with a fourth man partially visible on the far left. In the middle ground, several firefighters are positioned in the center and to the right, near a partially visible fire truck, with yellow poles and scattered water bottles on the grass. The damaged Pentagon building fills the background. As the camera slowly zooms in, the framing transitions to a medium shot, focusing on the three central men who now occupy the left and center of the frame. The man in the middle points toward the right. The firefighters and the Pentagon remain in the middle ground and background, respectively, though they are now more tightly framed. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video essentially depicts a static image, where all elements remain unchanged. In the foreground, three older white men in dark business suits appear to be walking across a grassy area. The man on the far left has white hair and wears a dark navy suit with a red and white patterned tie. The man in the center, with graying hair and a brown tie, gestures with his left arm, pointing toward the right side of the frame. The third man, with white hair and a striped tie, stands next to him, looking in the same direction. In the midground, several firefighters are present. One firefighter, with his back to the viewer, wears tan bunker pants and a blue t-shirt with partially obscured words on the back. Another firefighter in full tan gear, including an oxygen tank and helmet, stands nearby. Other firefighters in black and yellow gear are also visible. In the background, the large, light-colored facade of the Pentagon shows significant damage, with multiple windows blackened and broken from a fire. A red and white fire truck is parked near the building.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This still image captures an outdoor scene during the day on a grassy lawn in front of the Pentagon. The large, light-colored stone building in the background shows significant damage, with numerous windows blackened and broken, and smoke stains marring the facade. In the midground, several firefighters in tan and black uniforms with helmets and oxygen tanks are gathered near a partially visible emergency vehicle. A red caution tape line and several yellow poles are set up on the grass, where numerous empty plastic water bottles are scattered. In the foreground, several men in dark business suits appear to be walking across the lawn, with one individual pointing toward the right side of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
