    "pre_caption": "The video uses a full shot to display a single maroon shirt with white polka dots, laid flat on a whitewashed wooden surface. At the start, the shirt is fully spread out with its sleeves extended horizontally, occupying the center of the frame in the foreground, with the wooden planks filling the background across the entire frame. The camera is positioned directly above the shirt, providing a top-down view at a consistent height. As the video progresses, the shirt is gradually folded in place, reducing its visible area while remaining in the center foreground. At the end, the now-compact, rectangularly folded shirt shifts slightly to the right within the frame, moving from the center foreground to the right foreground, while the wooden surface remains static in the background. No other elements enter or leave the frame, and the camera position and angle remain unchanged throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a single maroon long-sleeved shirt with a collar and white polka dots, made of a soft, textured fabric. The shirt is initially displayed with its sleeves extended outward and the body fully spread, showing all its details clearly. Over the course of the video, the shirt is gradually folded into a compact, rectangular shape, with the sleeves and body neatly tucked in, resulting in a small, tidy bundle. At the very end of the video, the folded shirt, in its rectangular shape, appears to shift slightly to the right on its own.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors against a backdrop of whitewashed wooden planks arranged horizontally, with visible gaps and a slightly weathered texture. A single maroon long-sleeved shirt with a collar and white polka dot pattern is present, made of a soft, fabric material. The shirt is initially laid out flat with sleeves extended, then is shown neatly folded, occupying a smaller area on the same wooden surface. The lighting is even, with no strong shadows, and there are no overlays, text, or additional visual elements present.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
