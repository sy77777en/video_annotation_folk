    "pre_caption": "In a close-up, over-the-shoulder shot, a man is positioned in the center-left middle ground, facing right. The back of a woman's head and shoulder occupy the right foreground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, and the framing remains static throughout the clip. The background is indistinct and dark, with subtitles visible at the bottom of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white man with a dark beard and mustache is shown in a close-up, speaking to a woman. He wears a dark green beanie, a green jacket, and a lighter green tactical vest with a patch that reads \"G-25\". The woman, seen from over her shoulder, has blonde hair tied up in a bun and is wearing a light-colored collared shirt. The man is facing her, with a serious expression on his face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, the scene is set in a dimly lit, dark environment at night. A man wearing a dark green beanie and a green tactical vest with a \"G-25\" patch is visible, speaking. The back of another person's head and shoulder, wearing a light-colored shirt, is visible in the right foreground, while the background is indistinct and shrouded in darkness. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays subtitles that read, \"Price: Hadir's yours. Intel's mine.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
