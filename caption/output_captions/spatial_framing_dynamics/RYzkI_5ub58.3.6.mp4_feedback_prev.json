    "pre_caption": "An extreme close-up, static shot focuses on a spider. The spider's head is positioned in the center-right foreground, with its green legs extending into the top-right and bottom-left portions of the frame. It rests on a dark, textured surface that occupies the bottom-right foreground. A dark, out-of-focus background is visible in the left and top-left areas of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents an extreme close-up of a bright green spider. Its long, slender legs are a vibrant, translucent yellow-green, covered in distinct black bristles or spines. The spider's head, or cephalothorax, features a prominent reddish-brown patch where multiple small, black, shiny eyes are clearly visible, arranged in a distinct pattern. The posterior part of its body has a fuzzy, yellowish texture, while the rest of its body segments are green. The spider is positioned on a dark, textured surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A macro, close-up shot focuses on a spider against a dark, out-of-focus background. The spider has a reddish-brown head with several small, black, glossy eyes. Its body and legs are a translucent, vibrant lime green and are covered in prominent black, spiky hairs. The spider is positioned on a dark brown, textured surface, with two shorter front legs curled near its head.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
