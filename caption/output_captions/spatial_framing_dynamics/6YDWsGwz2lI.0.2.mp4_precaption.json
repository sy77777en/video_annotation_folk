    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a view of towering buildings lining a street, with a prominent skyscraper in the background. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighted by the symmetry of the architecture and the warm glow of streetlights. The scene emphasizes the scale and grandeur of the urban landscape rather than a specific object, creating a sense of immersion in the city environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor urban setting, showcasing a street flanked by tall, imposing buildings with a classic architectural style. The scene is set during the day, under a clear sky, allowing natural light to illuminate the area. The buildings are characterized by their vertical lines and numerous windows, with some displaying American flags. Streetlights are visible, casting a warm glow that contrasts with the cool tones of the buildings. The street is relatively empty, emphasizing the grandeur and scale of the architecture. The perspective is centered, drawing the viewer's eye towards a prominent skyscraper in the background, which stands as a focal point in the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban cityscape, focusing on a street flanked by tall buildings. The buildings are positioned on the left and right sides of the frame, extending vertically into the background, creating a symmetrical composition. The prominent skyscraper is centrally located in the background, serving as the focal point. Streetlights are visible in the middle ground on both sides, adding depth and contrast to the scene. The camera is positioned at street level, capturing the grandeur of the architecture from below, emphasizing the height and scale of the buildings. The framing remains consistent throughout the video, maintaining the viewer's focus on the architectural symmetry and the towering presence of the skyscraper.",
