    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark hair, a mustache, and black-rimmed glasses, wearing a grey patterned t-shirt, holds a silver pocket watch on a chain. After he releases the watch and moves away, the words \"macro room\" appear, with \"macro\" in white and \"room\" in teal. The silver pocket watch, featuring a white face and black hands, is shown in a slow-motion shot where it falls onto the table and bounces back up. Above it, several incandescent lightbulbs hanging from black cords simultaneously explode, shattering into pieces with flashes of light and puffs of smoke.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting against a solid black background, a wooden surface occupies the foreground. A man with glasses and a patterned shirt holds a swinging silver pocket watch and a film clapperboard before moving out of view. Several lit incandescent light bulbs hang from black cords above the table. The bulbs then explode in a sequence of bright flashes, sending shards of glass and puffs of smoke into the air. Throughout the event, the silver pocket watch slowly falls onto the table and bounces back up in the middleground. A text overlay appears, reading \"macro\" in white and \"room\" in a teal color.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of a man holding a pocket watch in front of him, with three lightbulbs hanging on each side of the frame. After he releases the pocket watch and leaves the frame, the words \"macro room\" appear against a black background. The pocket watch falls onto a table, and then six lightbulbs explode simultaneously.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera height is at the subject initially. After the man leaves the frame, the camera is positioned at a height between the lightbulbs and the pocket watch.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, with the camera at the subject's height. A man is positioned in the center middle ground, holding a pocket watch forward. A wooden table occupies the bottom foreground, while six lit lightbulbs hang from the top of the frame in the middle ground, with three on the left and three on the right against a black background. The man releases the watch and moves out of the frame to the right. As the watch falls toward the center of the table, the text \"macro room\" appears in the center middle ground. The camera is now positioned at a height between the falling watch and the hanging bulbs. The six lightbulbs at the top of the frame then explode simultaneously, while the pocket watch lands and bounces in the center foreground, with the text remaining stationary in the center middle ground.",
