    "pre_caption": "This scenery shot begins with a high-angle wide shot, looking directly down the center of a multi-story building's interior atrium. The walls of the upper floors frame the shot on all sides, creating a receding perspective toward the bottom of the atrium, which is positioned in the center background. The camera then plunges rapidly downward. This movement causes the surrounding walls and light fixtures to streak with motion blur, radiating from the center of the frame. As the camera descends, the lower floor, initially in the distant background, rushes toward the foreground, briefly revealing a poster and an exit sign in the center before the entire frame is consumed by the blur of motion, effectively transitioning to an extreme close-up on the rapidly approaching surface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a thrilling descent through what resembles the hallway of a hotel or apartment building atrium. The camera's first-person perspective races downward, accentuating the sense of speed and motion as the beige walls with white molding and light fixtures blur into streaks. As the camera plunges, a lower floor emerges, revealing details like a poster and a green emergency exit sign. The shot emphasizes the immense vertical scale and creates a dynamic, disorienting experience within the architectural space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A rapid downward view plunges through a multi-story hallway of a building, creating a dizzying effect. The walls, painted a neutral beige with white trim and molding, blur radially due to the swift motion. Rectangular light fixtures are visible on the ceilings of the levels below. At the distant end of the hallway, a poster protected by glass or a reflective cover, a green exit sign, and a glowing screen are briefly discernible before the view is completely obscured by the motion blur.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to an extreme close-up shot.",
