    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a woman positioned on the right side of the frame, running uphill along a slope. As she moves, she transitions into the center of the frame. Her silhouette is set against a dimly lit background, making details like her clothing or facial features indistinct. Towards the end, noticeable camera shaking or rolling occurs, placing her in the bottom-left corner. The video concludes with a subtitle reading \"That was long.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors in a mountainous region at dusk or dawn. A dark, silhouetted mountainside dominates both the foreground and mid-ground, sloping upwards from right to left. In the background, an electricity pylon is silhouetted against the sky. Behind the distant mountain range, a band of yellow-orange light marks the horizon, contrasting with the dark teal sky above. A silhouetted figure stands on the slope, moving slightly as their hair appears to blow in the wind.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of a woman running at the center of the frame. As the camera rolls while tracking her, it eventually positions the woman in the bottom-left corner of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, where a silhouetted woman is running at the center of the frame on a dark mountainside. This mountainside occupies the foreground and mid-ground, sloping upwards from the bottom-right towards the top-left of the frame. In the background, an electricity pylon is silhouetted on the upper left of the mountainside against the dark teal sky that fills the top portion of the frame. A band of yellow-orange light marks the horizon in the background, visible behind a distant mountain range, primarily in the center-right. As the camera tracks the woman running uphill, it rolls, which causes the entire scene to tilt and eventually positions the woman in the bottom-left corner of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
