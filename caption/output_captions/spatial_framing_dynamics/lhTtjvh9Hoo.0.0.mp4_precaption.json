    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light tan lioness is lying down on a sandy surface, facing the camera with sunlight illuminating its fur, making the fur on the left side of the frame appear more radiant. The lioness is holding a dark, reddish-brown, slightly cylindrical object between its front paws, actively licking and gnawing on it, its eyes partially closed and its ears perked up.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a lioness basking in the bright sunlight on a sunny day, with her fur appearing golden and shimmering on the left side of the frame due to the shadows. The ground is a mix of light brown sand or dirt and patches of short green grass. In the background, dense green foliage and a rock formation or textured wall suggest an enclosure.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a light tan lioness positioned in the center foreground, lying down and facing slightly towards the camera. The lioness holds a dark, reddish-brown object between its front paws, also in the center foreground. The ground, a mix of light brown sand and patches of short green grass, occupies the bottom foreground of the frame. In the background, dense green foliage is visible across the top right, while a rock formation or textured wall appears in the top left background. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the video.",
