    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with light-colored skin holds a blue smartphone circuit board with both hands, a gold-colored ring visible on their left ring finger. The circuit board features a prominent camera module with three lenses set in silver-colored metal housings. A large, silver-colored metal shield covers a central portion of the board, surrounded by various small electronic components, connectors, and thin black wires. The person uses a silver-colored precision screwdriver with a knurled handle to point at and touch the smallest of the three camera lenses.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot provides a top-down perspective of a person's hands holding a blue smartphone circuit board. The board features a prominent camera module with three lenses arranged vertically on the left, alongside a silver-colored metal shield and various other electronic components. A metallic screwdriver with a hexagonal handle is positioned over the board, its tip carefully touching the surface of the smallest, bottom-most camera lens. One of the hands holding the board wears a ring, and the background is a softly blurred surface with some indistinct dark objects.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a close-up, overhead shot, a blue smartphone circuit board is held in the center of the frame by two hands, positioned in the foreground. On the left side of the board, a camera module is visible. A silver-colored precision screwdriver extends from the right side of the frame into the center-left, with its tip touching the bottom-most camera lens. The hands holding the board are positioned on the left and right edges of the frame. The camera maintains a static, high-angle, top-down perspective throughout the shot.",
