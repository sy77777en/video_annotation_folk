    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person dressed in a light-colored winter jacket, dark pants, and dark-colored gloves, walking on a snowy landscape. The individual is holding a camera in one hand and is facing away from the viewer, suggesting they are observing the scenery. The person is wearing a hood, indicating cold weather conditions. The lighting suggests a sunrise or sunset, casting a warm glow over the scene. The person appears to be alone, with no other human subjects visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor winter scene during sunset, featuring a snowy landscape with a person dressed in a white jacket and dark pants. The environment is characterized by expansive snow-covered terrain, with the sun casting a warm, orange glow across the sky and snow. The snow appears soft and slightly windswept, suggesting a cold, breezy atmosphere. In the distance, there are indistinct shapes, possibly rocks or structures, partially obscured by the snow and light. The overall setting conveys a sense of vastness and isolation, with the person standing amidst the natural beauty of the snowy expanse.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a person walking through a snowy landscape. The subject occupies the center of the frame, with their full body visible from the knees up. Initially, the person is positioned near the left side of the frame, moving towards the right. As they walk, their position shifts from the left to the center-right of the frame. The subject remains in the foreground throughout the sequence, while the expansive snowy terrain forms the middle ground and background. The sun, low on the horizon, is situated in the background, casting a warm glow over the scene. The camera maintains a steady height, positioned at the subject's level, capturing the movement smoothly without any noticeable changes in angle or perspective. The subject's consistent pace and direction are clearly depicted within the stable framing.",
