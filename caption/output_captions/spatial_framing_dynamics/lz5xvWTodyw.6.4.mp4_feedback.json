    "pre_caption": "This video is presented from a first-person perspective, initially showing the character's right hand holding a pistol in the bottom right foreground. A second man stands in the center-left middle ground. In the background, a door is visible on the far left, with a large vase in the left corner and several portraits hanging on the back wall. The camera then pans to the right, bringing the upper body of the first-person character into view on the left side of the frame. This movement shifts the second man to the center and reveals a side table with a telephone and a chair in the right middle ground. Finally, the camera pans back to the left, removing the first-person character's body from the frame and returning the focus to the second man, now positioned in the center-left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is presented from a first-person perspective, showing two men in a room. The primary character is a light-skinned, middle-aged man with dark brown hair, a full beard, and a mustache. He is dressed in a dark long coat over a vest and white shirt and is seen holding a dark pistol in his right hand. The second man, standing in the background, is a dark-skinned, middle-aged man with short black hair. He is wearing a formal dark suit, a light gray vest, a white shirt, a white bow tie, and black round sunglasses, and he stands with one hand on his chest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, pans across a dimly lit room with dark green walls and a herringbone-patterned wood floor. The space is illuminated by a single wall sconce, revealing several framed portraits of men and additional paintings hanging on the background wall. Furnishings include a dark wood side table with a candlestick-style telephone, a single cream-colored chair, and a large, ornate blue-and-white vase in a corner. A wooden door with a brass handle is visible to the left. Two men in period clothing are present in the room, with the character in the foreground holding a pistol.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a first-person perspective in a video game, beginning with two middle-aged male characters in a classic house. The shot size is primarily a wide shot, but due to camera and subject movements, the two figures alternate between being fully in frame and having only their upper bodies visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
