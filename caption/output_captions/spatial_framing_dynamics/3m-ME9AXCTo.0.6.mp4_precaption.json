    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with voluminous, shoulder-length, curly blonde hair is slow dancing with a young woman. He wears a light-colored suit jacket, a black bow tie, and a white flower boutonni\u00e8re on his lapel. The woman, who has long, straight, light brown hair, wears a pink and white floral corsage on her left wrist. They are holding each other closely, with her arms resting on his shoulders, as they dance and talk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place indoors at a dimly lit event, possibly a dance, under a dark ceiling. The background is adorned with shiny, star-shaped foil decorations and strings of small, multi-colored lights. The space is bathed in atmospheric lighting with prominent hues of red, purple, and yellow, creating a soft, moody ambiance. A young couple is slow dancing in the center of the frame, with the camera capturing their movements from close, shifting angles against the festive backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium close-up shot initially frames a young man and woman from behind the man's right shoulder. The man's back is in the center-left of the frame, while the woman is positioned in the center-right, with her face partially visible. In the background, star-shaped decorations hang from the top of the frame. The camera then shifts to the right, revealing a frontal view of the man in the center as he looks toward the woman, whose back is now on the left. The perspective then returns to a position behind the man before shifting back to a frontal view of him in the center, with the woman on the left. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout these movements.",
