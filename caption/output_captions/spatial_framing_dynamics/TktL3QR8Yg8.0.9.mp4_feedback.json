    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of a person's hands and forearms, positioned in the left and center of the frame and occupying the foreground, as they manipulate a hexagonal metal rod and nut. The hands and arms are at the same height as the camera, which is level with the subject. The background is blurred, with indistinct objects and warm lighting visible in the middle ground and background, mostly toward the right side of the frame. The camera then shifts focus and framing to a close-up of the mechanical model, which fills the center and right of the frame in the foreground and middle ground. The structure\u2019s metal beams and plates are clearly visible, with the camera remaining at the same height as the model. Throughout the video, the spatial transition moves the main subject from the hands and arms on the left and center foreground to the mechanical model in the center and right foreground, while the background remains out of focus and unchanged.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on a close-up of a person's hands and arms, clad in a long-sleeved shirt in a beige-like color with dark vertical stripes, as they assemble a metal object. The hands are shown manipulating a hexagonal metal rod and a nut. The perspective then shifts to reveal the larger object being constructed: a complex mechanical model made from silver-colored and red-painted metal strips, brackets, nuts, and bolts, characteristic of a construction set. The intricate structure consists of perforated metal pieces fastened together, forming part of what appears to be a model Ferris wheel or a similar elaborate machine.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a warmly lit room with a blurred background that suggests a cozy, possibly vintage environment. The main focus is a mechanical structure made of metal beams and plates, featuring a combination of silver and reddish-brown components with visible bolts, nuts, and perforated holes. The metal parts have a matte finish and a slightly worn texture, with some elements showing signs of use. The structure is assembled with precision, and its geometric shapes include straight bars, triangular supports, and rectangular plates. In the background, indistinct objects and soft lighting contribute to a calm, workshop-like atmosphere. There are no overlays, text, or digital elements present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.\n\nThe video is continuous, please avoid descriptions like \"next shot\"",
