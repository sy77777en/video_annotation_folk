    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video primarily displays the blurred lights of several cars moving in darkness. On the left side, the lights appear as elongated white streaks, representing headlights. On the right side, the red glows represent taillights, and there is also a visible yellow glow on the roof of the car. The cars themselves are not clearly discernible, only their illumination against a very dark background, suggesting a nighttime scene on a road. Towards the right, a dimly lit, curved structure, possibly part of the roadway or a nearby building, briefly comes into view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an aerial view of a dark highway at night. Several sets of blurred white headlights, red taillights, and yellow roof lights from moving vehicles are visible against the black road surface. The surrounding area is predominantly dark, with a dimly lit, curved section of road or an interchange briefly appearing on the right side.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In this extreme wide shot captured from above, elongated, blurred white headlights occupy the left middle ground, while red and yellow taillights are positioned in the right middle ground, with all sets of lights moving from the top towards the bottom of the dark frame. As the lights on the right descend, a dimly lit, curved structure emerges in the top right background, then moves slightly towards the center-right background as the overall perspective shifts.",
