    "pre_caption": "A wide shot, filmed from a high angle above the subjects, shows a group of horses and jockeys in the top left of the frame, racing on a dirt track that curves from the top left towards the right. The green grass infield occupies the bottom right and center of the frame. In the foreground, a graphical overlay is positioned in the bottom left corner, and another is in the top right corner. The camera pans to the right, following the horses as they move along the track toward the center of the frame, with the pack spreading out slightly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of horses and jockeys are shown from an overhead perspective, racing on a brown dirt track. A graphical overlay in the bottom left corner identifies the event as the \"148TH KENTUCKY DERBY\" and lists several horses with their numbers and odds, such as \"4 SUMMER IS TOMORROW 36-1,\" \"6 MESSIER 7-1,\" and \"16 CYBERKNIFE 14-1.\" Next to some of the horse names are small icons representing the jockey's silks. In the top right corner, another graphic displays the race progress, showing \"1/4 MILE 21.78\" and later \"1/2 MILE 45.36,\" next to the NBC peacock logo.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a horse race in progress on a wide, light-brown dirt track that curves to the left. Inside the track, a green grass infield is visible. A group of horses with jockeys in colorful silks gallops along the track. Overlays are present on the screen. In the bottom left corner, a graphic for the \"148TH KENTUCKY DERBY\" lists the names, numbers, and odds for several horses. In the top right corner, another overlay shows a race timer and a network logo.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
