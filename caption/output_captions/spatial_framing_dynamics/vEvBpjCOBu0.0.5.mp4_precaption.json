    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A collection of nine clear, empty drinking glasses of various shapes and sizes is arranged in a row on a light brown, industrial-style table. The table features visible rivets on its corners. The glassware includes a tall pint-style glass, several tumblers of decreasing height, a tall and narrow glass, a short and wide rounded glass, and two small shot-style glasses. Many of the glasses share a common design feature, with a slight indentation or faceted section near their base.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting with a black background that transitions to a blue-grey tint at the bottom, a row of nine clear, empty glass tumblers of varying shapes and sizes is arranged on a tan, industrial-style metal surface, which could be a bench or a table. The surface features visible rivets on its corners and legs. The glasses, ranging from tall and slender to short and wide, are illuminated by even lighting, creating reflections on their surfaces.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A wide shot frames a collection of nine glasses arranged in a horizontal row across the center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. These glasses rest on an industrial-style table that occupies the bottom half of the frame, also in the middle ground. The background is a solid black expanse. The camera is positioned at the level of the glasses, and the entire composition remains static throughout the shot, with no movement from the camera or the subjects.",
