    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three vintage military aircraft flying in formation over a desert landscape. The main subject is a large, twin-engine plane with a distinctive white color scheme, featuring a high wing and multiple propellers. It is centrally positioned and slightly ahead of the other aircraft, emphasizing its prominence. To the left, a smaller, single-engine plane with a dark, metallic finish and a sleek design flies in close proximity, with objects mounted underneath it. On the right, another aircraft, similar in color to the one on the left but differing in style, features two cockpits and a horizontal strut in the middle, also with objects mounted underneath. The planes are depicted in flight, showcasing their aerodynamic shapes and intricate details, such as visible propellers and landing gear. The video captures the coordinated movement and relative positions of the aircraft, highlighting the main plane's central role in the formation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures several vintage aircraft flying in formation over a vast desert landscape during the daytime. The terrain below consists of light-colored, arid ground, with large, brown, rocky mountains rising in the distance under a clear, pale blue sky. In the foreground, the wing of a dark-colored plane is visible, flying alongside other aircraft, including a single-engine propeller plane and a twin-engine biplane. The biplane, positioned centrally in the background, has a yellow and white fuselage. Two large, cylindrical objects are mounted beneath one of the planes on the left side of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
