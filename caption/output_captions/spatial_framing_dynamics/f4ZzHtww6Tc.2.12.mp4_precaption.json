    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video predominantly showcases a teenage boy skateboarding from the left to the right side of the frame. As the video progresses, the boy performs a trick by jumping over the curb and continues moving toward the far left of the frame. In the background, two stationary cars\u2014one black and one white\u2014are visible, but the emphasis is on the teenager's dynamic motion rather than the parked vehicles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An objective, low-angle shot captures a paved urban alleyway during the day under an overcast sky. The alley is flanked by red brick buildings, one of which features a yellow-painted door frame. A large green dumpster and a dark sedan, which appears more black than blue, are positioned on the left side of the alley, while a white sedan is parked further down. A wooden fence runs along the right side, and a network of utility poles and overhead wires crisscrosses the bright sky above.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a man skateboarding. It starts with an extreme wide shot of him, and as he moves closer to the camera, his size gradually increases, transitioning to a full shot with dynamic size. Then, his upper body exits the frame, presenting a medium shot of him. As he moves further away from the camera, the shot returns to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Most of the time, the camera is at the same height as the subject. However, when the skateboarder jumps, he is higher than the camera. After landing back on the ground, he returns to the same height as the camera.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a low-angle, extreme wide shot of an urban alley, with a concrete curb in the immediate foreground. A skateboarder is initially positioned in the left middle ground, next to a large green dumpster. A black car is parked in the left foreground, while a white car is visible further back in the center background. As the skateboarder moves from the left toward the camera, the shot size dynamically increases to a full shot. He then jumps over the foreground curb, moving into the top center of the frame, which briefly becomes a medium shot as his lower body exits the view. After landing in the right middle ground, he skates away from the camera along the right side of the alley, causing the shot to transition back to an extreme wide shot as he becomes a small figure in the right background.",
