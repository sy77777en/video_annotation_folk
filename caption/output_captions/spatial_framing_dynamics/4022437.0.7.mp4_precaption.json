    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a comprehensive view of a black Mercedes-Benz S550 sedan from the rear left corner. Initially, the S550 badging on the back is not visible, but the Mercedes emblem is noticeable on the rear left wheel. Both front  doors and the rear left-side doors are wide open, showcasing the light-colored interior with beige or tan leather seats, door panels, and wood trim accents. The car features a glossy black exterior, silver five-spoke alloy wheels, tinted windows, and a sunroof. Small red reflectors are present on the inner edges of the open doors. As the camera gradually moves backward, the entire vehicle is revealed, with several buildings visible in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A black sedan with a tan leather interior is parked in an asphalt lot during the day, with both left-side doors open. The car features silver, five-spoke wheels. In the background, two plain, light-colored buildings stand behind the car, with additional structures visible in the distance, along with trees and a distant construction crane under a bright sky. The camera slowly pulls back, revealing more of the paved lot marked with white lines.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a black sedan positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, angled with its rear left corner in the bottom right foreground. The car's open left-side doors extend towards the left side of the frame, creating depth. In the background, a light-colored building sits behind the car, with trees to the left and a crane in the top right. The asphalt parking lot occupies the foreground and middle ground. The camera then slowly pulls backward, transitioning the view into a wide shot. This movement makes the car appear smaller while it remains centrally located, revealing more of the parking lot in the foreground and a wider perspective of the background elements. The camera is positioned at the car's level throughout the shot.",
