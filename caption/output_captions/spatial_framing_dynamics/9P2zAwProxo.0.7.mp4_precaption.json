    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with light skin and a beard is shown from a low-angle perspective in a snowy, wooded area. He is dressed in winter sports attire, consisting of a black helmet, black ski goggles, a black jacket with white sleeves, and black pants. He wears black gloves and has a pink and white pass with black lettering clipped to his jacket. The man is in a low, athletic stance, holding a ski pole with a red strap in one hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot captures a person in ski gear moving through a snowy forest during the daytime. The camera, held at a low angle, looks up at the person and the surrounding environment. The ground is completely covered in white snow. Tall, bare trees with numerous thin branches rise on all sides, their tops reaching towards the bright, overcast sky. The person, wearing a helmet, goggles, and winter clothing, holds a ski pole while navigating the wooded, snow-covered terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot captured from a low angle, a man is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground. The camera, looking up at him, moves backward through a snowy landscape. Surrounding the man, bare trees are visible in the background, their trunks extending from the bottom of the frame towards the top, creating a sense of enclosure. As the camera retreats, the man maintains his central foreground position, while the trees in the background appear to move past, enhancing the sense of motion through the forest.",
