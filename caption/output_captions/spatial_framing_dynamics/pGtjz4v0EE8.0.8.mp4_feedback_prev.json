    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot of a Venetian canal, captured from a high-angle perspective. The scene opens with an extreme wide shot where historic buildings line the top, left, and right sides of the frame, situated in the middle ground and background. The canal itself occupies the bottom and center, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. A white water bus travels in the middle ground, slightly right of center, while various gondolas are positioned throughout: one is in the foreground at the bottom left, another is in the middle ground to the left, and several are docked along the left bank. The camera then slowly zooms in, reframing the scene into a wide shot that brings the buildings and boat activity in the middle ground into a tighter, more focused composition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a bustling canal in Venice, Italy. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of the historic city rather than a specific main subject. The murky green water of the Grand Canal is filled with activity, featuring several white and yellow vaporettos (water buses) moving through the center, alongside several traditional black gondolas, some being rowed and others docked. Lining the canal are rows of classic Venetian buildings, characterized by their aged, multi-story facades in shades of tan, yellow, and off-white, topped with reddish-brown tiled roofs, creating a dense and picturesque architectural landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor, daytime scene captures a wide canal in Venice, Italy, lined on both sides with historic, multi-story buildings featuring terracotta tile roofs and aged facades in shades of yellow and beige. The greenish water of the canal is active with boat traffic, including a white water bus moving through the center and several black gondolas, some with passengers, navigating the waterway. Other boats are moored along wooden docks at the canal's edge. The scene is brightly lit with a warm, yellowish tint and a slightly hazy, high-contrast quality.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
