    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young male diver, wearing blue swim trunks, performing a dive. He is seen mid-air, starting with his back facing the camera, then flipping to rotate his body and face the camera with his chest and face. His legs remain straight throughout the dive, and his hair is short and light-colored. The dive concludes with him entering the water, creating a splash, and the video continues to capture a brief moment of him submerged beneath the surface, highlighting his athletic form and the precision of his dive.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in an indoor natatorium during a diving event. A diver performs a dive from a height above the white platform marked with the words \"IUPUI\" and \"INDIANAPOLIS\" in black background and white text. In the background, a large white wall displays a list of names, and a prominent red, white, and blue banner for the \"U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM TRIALS\" hangs nearby, featuring the Olympic rings and logos for USA Diving and NBC Sports. The camera follows the diver's descent, culminating in a splash in the clear blue water. The view then shifts to an underwater perspective, showing the diver submerged amidst a cloud of bubbles against the blue-tiled pool floor.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "A full, low-angle shot initially frames the diver in the top center of the scene, mid-air. In the background, a white wall is on the left, and a red banner is on the right. The camera tilts down to follow the diver as he descends toward the bottom center, bringing the diving platform into the middle ground, where a cameraman is also visible on the left. After the diver enters the water at the bottom center, the view cuts to a high-angle underwater shot, showing the diver submerged at the bottom of the frame against the background of the blue-tiled pool.",
