    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a dense array of small, glowing blue dots arranged in three-dimensional space, forming intricate patterns that suggest depth and perspective. The dots vary slightly in size and brightness, with some appearing more prominent than others, and are distributed along lines that converge toward a central vanishing point, creating a tunnel-like or starburst effect. The overall composition is abstract, with no recognizable people, animals, or objects, and the visual focus is on the geometric arrangement and luminous quality of the blue dots as they form dynamic, radiating structures.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an abstract, indoor environment filled with countless small, glowing blue dots arranged in a three-dimensional grid pattern. These dots appear suspended in a dark space, creating a tunnel-like effect with lines of light converging toward a central vanishing point. The dots vary slightly in size and brightness, and their arrangement forms geometric shapes and radiating lines, giving the scene a sense of depth and motion. The overall color scheme is dominated by shades of blue and black, with the glowing dots providing the primary illumination against the dark background. The visual elements are smooth and uniform, with no visible texture or markings beyond the luminous quality of the dots. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining its abstract, digital appearance without any discernible natural or architectural features.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video displays numerous small, glowing blue dots distributed throughout a dark space, forming a three-dimensional grid. In the first frame, the dots are arranged along straight lines that extend from the left side of the frame toward a central vanishing point near the center-right, creating a tunnel-like effect. The dots occupy the entire frame, with higher density toward the center and sparser distribution at the edges, and are present in the foreground, middle ground, and background, enhancing the sense of depth. In the second frame, the perspective shifts so that the lines of dots now radiate symmetrically from the center of the frame outward in all directions, intensifying the starburst effect. The dots remain distributed across all depths, but the central convergence point is now at the center of the frame, with lines extending toward the top, bottom, left, and right edges. The camera appears to be positioned within the same plane as the dots, at the level of the grid, and the transition between frames involves a shift in the camera\u2019s orientation, moving from an angled view toward the vanishing point to a direct, head-on view of the central convergence.",
