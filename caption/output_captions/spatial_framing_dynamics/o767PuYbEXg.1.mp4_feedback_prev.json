    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a pod of whales swimming near the surface of the ocean, captured from above by a drone. The whales are positioned primarily in the center and left of the frame, with some moving towards the upper left and others towards the lower left. The scene is dynamic, with several whales breaking the surface, creating white foam and circular ripples, while others remain mostly submerged, their turquoise flippers visible through the water. The camera maintains a high angle, looking down at the scene, emphasizing the vastness of the ocean and the movement of the whales. The ocean's surface is a deep blue, with swirling white foam indicating the whales' activity beneath. The \"BBC\" logo is visible in the top left corner, providing a point of reference for the frame's orientation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a pod of large whales swimming near the surface of dark blue ocean water. The whales have dark gray or black dorsal sides, with some displaying white or light-colored markings on their undersides or pectoral flippers, which appear as distinct, bright turquoise patches when viewed through the water. Several whales are actively moving, with some breaking the surface, their heads and backs becoming visible and creating significant white foam and circular ripples. Other whales remain mostly submerged, with their turquoise flippers being the most prominent visible feature. The whales are clustered together, interacting and moving as a group, with several whales heading towards the upper left corner of the frame, while most are moving towards the lower left corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, filmed by a drone, captures an expansive view of the ocean, showcasing a deep blue sea with swirling white foam and bubbles on the surface, indicating movement beneath the water. The setting is outdoors, with no visible land, emphasizing the vastness of the ocean. The time of day is not explicitly clear, but the lighting suggests it is during daylight hours. Notable visual elements include the dynamic patterns created by the water's movement, with areas of lighter blue and turquoise hinting at the presence of marine life below. Whales can be seen swimming beneath the surface and occasionally breaching, creating white foam and circular ripples. The scene is devoid of any architectural features, focusing solely on the natural environment. Overlay elements include a \"BBC\" logo in the top left corner, indicating the source of the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
