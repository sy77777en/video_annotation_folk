    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a first-person perspective of someone standing in a narrow alleyway next to a building with a green metal door covered in posters and graffiti. A low concrete wall runs along the other side of the alley. Initially, the view looks down the alley towards a distant cityscape under a clear sky. Then, a pair of hands, belonging to a person wearing a black jacket, raises a black digital camera into the frame, aiming it towards the cityscape to take a picture. The camera's screen displays the cityscape view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, navigates an urban walkway in Porto during clear daylight. The scene begins alongside a building with a light green facade marked by graffiti, various posters including a large colorful one and three smaller black-and-white dragon-themed prints, a sticker-covered drainpipe, and a curtained window. The view then moves along the surface paved with small square tiles, which is lined by a concrete barrier, to encompass train tracks below and the distant cityscape featuring a domed building, all under a clear blue sky with a few birds. Subsequently, two hands appear, raising a black digital camera to frame the urban panorama on its screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a view down a narrow, paved alleyway. A building with a light green metal door, adorned with posters and graffiti, occupies the right foreground, alongside a sticker-covered drainpipe and a curtained window. A low concrete wall runs along the left foreground and middle ground. Beyond the wall, train tracks are visible in the middle ground, leading towards a distant cityscape with a domed building in the background center, all under a clear sky at the top of the frame. Subsequently, a pair of hands, clad in a black jacket, enters from the bottom of the frame, raising a black digital camera into the center foreground. The camera is aimed at the cityscape, and its screen, displaying this view, becomes the central focus, with the original background cityscape now visible around and above the camera. The perspective is consistently first-person, at eye level.",
