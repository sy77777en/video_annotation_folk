    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a pair of hands and the lower half of the arms, which have visible arm hair, interacting with a twisted long balloon submerged in a water tank. The hands, with light skin tone, are positioned to press the light blue balloon into the water. The left hand holds a pin, used to puncture the balloon, causing its outer skin to shrink rapidly. Despite the puncture, the water inside initially retains the balloon's shape before dispersing. The hands are engaged in a precise action, demonstrating a controlled and deliberate movement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an underwater scene in a clear tank filled with water. The setting is indoors, with a focus on a pair of hands interacting with a flexible, light blue balloon tube. The water is clear, allowing for a detailed view of the hands and the balloon tube. The background is a plain white surface, enhancing the visibility of the elements within the tank. Bubbles are present, indicating movement and interaction with the water. The lighting is bright, highlighting the smooth texture and glossy surface of the balloon tube. The scene conveys a sense of clarity and focus on the interaction between the hands and the balloon tube within the water.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a pair of hands pressing a twisted long balloon into a water tank. The left hand uses a pin to puncture the balloon, causing the outer skin of the balloon to shrink rapidly. The water inside the balloon still maintains the original shape of the balloon, and then disperses.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on the hands and the lower half of the arms, which occupy a significant portion of the frame. The hands, positioned in the foreground, interact with a light blue, twisted balloon submerged in a water tank. Initially, the left hand, holding a pin, is located on the left side of the frame, while the right hand supports the balloon on the right. Both hands are in the middle ground, with the balloon extending across the center of the frame. As the pin punctures the balloon, the outer skin shrinks, and water starts to disperse, creating bubbles and ripples. The hands remain in similar positions throughout, maintaining control over the balloon. The background is a plain white surface, situated behind the water tank, providing a neutral backdrop. The camera remains at the subject's level, capturing the detailed interaction between the hands and the balloon within the water. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or camera height, ensuring a consistent focus on the precise actions taking place.",
