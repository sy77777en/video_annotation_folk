    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows the rear portion of a silver and black racing car. A large, black rear wing dominates the view, featuring the letters in a bold, white, stylized font, although it is difficult to discern clearly due to the angle of the shot. The wing is held in place by two silver-colored, curved support struts. The car's body, visible below the wing, is adorned with a blue, bold, stylized font that is partially visible. A small, pink, cursive short sentence is present on the trunk area, just beneath the wing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on the rear of a car captures the vehicle as it speeds down a long asphalt road. The setting is a vast, arid desert under a clear blue sky, with a range of mountains visible on the horizon. The foreground emphasizes both the car's large, black rear spoiler and the rear portion of the car. The spoiler features white lettering and is supported by silver brackets. The car's body has a blue and black livery. A pink short sentence is positioned on the trunk below the spoiler. The desert terrain, characterized by sand and sparse vegetation, rushes by as the car moves forward.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is locked onto the back of a moving racing car. The lower part of the frame shows the car\u2019s body and rear wing, while the background reveals a vast desert landscape with distant mountains.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A locked-on point-of-view shot is framed from the rear of a racing car, with the car's body and a large, centered rear wing occupying the bottom foreground. The asphalt road begins at the bottom of the frame and recedes into the middle ground, converging toward the center. On the left and right, the arid desert landscape stretches from the foreground into the middle ground. A mountain range is positioned in the background along the horizon, beneath a clear sky that fills the top half of the frame. While the car's rear remains static relative to the camera, the road and surrounding desert appear to rush rapidly away from the middle ground towards the foreground, creating a strong sense of forward motion. The distant mountains remain relatively fixed in the background. The camera is positioned at the level of the car's rear.",
