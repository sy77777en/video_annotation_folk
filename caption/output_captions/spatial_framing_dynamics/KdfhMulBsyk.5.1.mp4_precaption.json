    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures the vibrant essence of a cityscape at night, highlighting the dynamic movement of cars on the street and the glow of street lamps lining the road. Neon lights in hues of red, purple, green, and yellow illuminate the scene, reflecting off surfaces and creating a lively, almost surreal atmosphere. As the camera pans upward, it reveals the screens, windows, and rooftops of buildings, adding depth and dimension to the scene. The focus is on the interplay of lights and colors, emphasizing the bustling energy and scale of the city, allowing the viewer to appreciate the overall ambiance and intricate patterns formed by the lights and structures.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, filmed by a drone, captures a vibrant urban scene at night. The setting is an outdoor cityscape, characterized by a kaleidoscope of neon lights in vivid colors such as purple, green, and orange. These lights illuminate the streets and buildings, creating a dynamic and colorful atmosphere. The architecture features modern structures with sleek lines and reflective surfaces, enhancing the futuristic feel. The streets below are bustling with movement, as vehicles navigate the illuminated roads, their headlights adding to the array of lights. The drone's perspective offers a sweeping view of the city, highlighting the interplay of light and shadow across the urban landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a vibrant cityscape at night, captured from a drone's perspective. Initially, the frame is filled with neon lights in various colors, such as red, purple, green, and yellow, reflecting off surfaces and creating a dynamic atmosphere. The camera starts with a focus on the street level, where the lights and movement of cars are visible in the foreground. As the camera pans upward, it transitions to reveal the middle ground and background, showcasing the illuminated facades, windows, and rooftops of buildings. The neon lights and street lamps line the roads, adding depth and dimension to the scene. The camera maintains a high angle throughout, emphasizing the scale and energy of the city, with the interplay of lights and colors forming intricate patterns across the urban landscape.",
