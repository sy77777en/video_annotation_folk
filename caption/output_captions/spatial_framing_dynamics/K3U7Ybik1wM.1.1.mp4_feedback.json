    "pre_caption": "This is a full shot of a red armchair positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground. The view is framed by a dark, out-of-focus post in the left foreground and another on the right, with a light-colored wooden railing separating the camera from the chair. In the background, a sloped ceiling and a window are visible. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. Throughout the shot, a visual effect causes the pattern on the centrally located armchair to warp and swirl with multicolored concentric circles, while the camera and all other elements in the scene remain static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A vintage-style armchair, upholstered in red patterned fabric with a high back and carved wooden legs, is positioned on a carpeted landing behind a wooden railing. Throughout the video, a psychedelic visual effect is applied to the chair, causing its pattern to warp and swirl as multicolored concentric circles ripple across its surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene on a carpeted upper landing features a red, patterned armchair of a vintage design with curved wooden arms and legs. The view is captured from a level but fixed Dutch angle, looking through the vertical spindles of a light-colored wooden railing, with a dark, out-of-focus post framing the shot in the foreground. Beyond the railing, a sloped ceiling with exposed wooden beams and a window revealing daylight and greenery are visible. The intricate pattern on the red armchair continuously distorts and swirls with a colorful, psychedelic visual effect, while the rest of the room remains static.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
