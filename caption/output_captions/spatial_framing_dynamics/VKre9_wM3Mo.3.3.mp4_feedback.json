    "pre_caption": "A medium, high-angle shot centers on a toilet in the middle ground, viewed from directly above. A glowing blue light is positioned in the center of the toilet bowl. In the bottom left foreground, a white text overlay lists three types of toilets. To the left of the toilet, in the middle ground, are two cylindrical objects. The frame remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a toilet with an open lid, showcasing a modern design with a smooth, white surface. Inside the bowl, there is a noticeable blue element, possibly indicating water or a cleaning agent. The toilet is positioned centrally, with a visible pull chain mechanism on the left side. To the right of the toilet, there are two rolls of toilet paper stacked vertically. The video highlights the toilet's functionality, focusing on its washdown and washout features.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a monochromatic, gray setting, a top-down view focuses on a white toilet with its lid open. A bright, glowing blue light emanates from the bottom of the toilet bowl. To the left, white text overlays list three types of toilets: \"Pull chain toilet,\" \"Washdown toilet,\" and \"Washout toilet,\" with lines connecting the phrases.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
