    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dynamic landscape scenery shot, flying low and fast across the surface of a vibrant, turquoise glacial lake. In the background, a massive, rugged mountain rises steeply, its lower slopes a mix of brown and purplish rock, while its peaks are crowned with a thick, white glacier under a clear, deep blue sky. Thin waterfalls of meltwater cascade down the rocky face from the glacier's edge, feeding the lake below. The shot lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to immerse the viewer in the vast, pristine, and powerful alpine environment. The focus is on capturing the majestic scale and raw beauty of the natural scene rather than highlighting a specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone glides low across the rippling surface of a vibrant turquoise alpine lake during the day. In the background, a massive, rugged mountain rises under a clear, deep blue sky. The upper portion of the mountain is covered in a thick white glacier, while the lower slopes consist of steep, reddish-brown and gray rock faces, streaked with meltwater. Along the left shoreline, a brown scree slope meets the edge of the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This scenery video is presented as an extreme wide shot, focusing on the landscape rather than a specific subject. The shot begins with the turquoise lake surface filling the foreground and the bottom half of the frame. A brown scree slope occupies the middle ground on the left, while a large, snow-capped mountain dominates the background, filling the upper half of the frame. The camera moves forward and slightly to the left at a low angle, just above the water. As the camera advances, the scree slope on the left moves out of the frame, bringing the viewer closer to the base of the mountain, which remains the central element in the background.",
