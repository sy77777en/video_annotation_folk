    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a vibrant underwater coral reef ecosystem teeming with life. Various types of coral formations are visible, including large, branching brown structures and smaller white soft corals. Numerous small, predominantly yellow fish, with a few pink and blue ones, swim amongst and around the different coral structures in the clear blue water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An underwater scene captures a vibrant coral reef in clear, deep blue water. On the left, a large, dark, tree-like coral structure stands, while on the right is a mound of green, bumpy coral. In the right foreground, various smaller corals, including white branching and soft pale-yellow types, are visible. Numerous small, bright yellow-orange fish swim in schools around the coral formations, with a few other fish of different colors and sizes scattered throughout the brightly lit aquatic environment.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a static underwater scene from a slightly low-angle perspective. A large, dark, tree-like coral formation is positioned in the left middle ground, extending from the bottom of the frame upwards. To its right, a mound of green coral occupies the right side of the frame, stretching from the middle ground into the background. In the bottom right foreground, smaller white and pale-yellow corals are situated. Numerous small, yellow fish are clustered around the corals on the right, moving between the foreground and middle ground, while other individual fish are scattered throughout the middle ground and the deep blue water that fills the background and upper portion of the frame.",
