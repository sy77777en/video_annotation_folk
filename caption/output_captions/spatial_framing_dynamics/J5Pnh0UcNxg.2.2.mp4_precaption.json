    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an interior scenery shot of a dimly lit bedroom at night. The scene reveals a dark-colored trunk with a pink interior, sitting open on the floor next to a white, three-drawer dresser, before a slow pan to the left shows a dark doorway leading into a hallway where a faint, cool light emanates from the distance. There is no main subject, as the focus is on establishing a mysterious and suspenseful atmosphere through the low-key lighting and shadowy environment. The camera's movement across the space serves to build tension by exploring the setting itself rather than focusing on a particular object or character.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit bedroom at night, an open, dark-colored trunk with a pink interior rests on the floor. To the left of the trunk stands a white chest of drawers with three drawers and dark, round knobs. The scene, cast in deep shadows and a cool, blue-toned light, pans to the left to reveal a dark hallway with white doors.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot of a dimly lit room, with no main subject present. The shot begins with an open trunk positioned in the foreground at the center-right of the frame, with a white dresser to its left in the middle ground. The camera, positioned at a low height, slowly pans to the left. As the camera moves, the trunk exits the frame on the right, and the dresser shifts to occupy the right side of the frame. The pan concludes by revealing a dark doorway in the center-left, which opens into a hallway visible in the background.",
