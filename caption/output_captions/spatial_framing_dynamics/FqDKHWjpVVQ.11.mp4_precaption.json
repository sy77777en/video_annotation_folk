    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective in a video game, a player holds a black assault rifle, both arms equipped with gray-black armor. Initially, the player sees another soldier. As the camera moves and pans mainly to the left, a dark, open-frame military vehicle comes into view, followed by a soldier in green and brown camouflage lying on the dusty ground in front of a two-story, light-colored building. The view is overlaid with a heads-up display, which includes a blue minimap in the bottom-left corner and blue-and-white indicators for ammunition and health in the bottom-right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moves through a sunlit, dusty outdoor area during the daytime. The setting features a two-story, white concrete building with a flat roof and an external metal staircase. Sparse green trees and shrubs are scattered across the arid, dirt-covered ground. The view peeks out from behind a dark structure with a slatted window. The camera then pans and moves mainly to the left, moving past a military vehicle and revealing the two-story building. A soldier lying on the ground in front of the two-story building comes into view. A video game heads-up display (HUD) is overlaid on the scene, showing a minimap in the bottom-left corner and information such as ammunition count and health status in the bottom-right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the scene initially frames the view from behind a large, dark structure that occupies the right foreground. A military vehicle is positioned in the center-left middle ground, with a building in the background. The player's weapon is visible in the bottom-right foreground. The camera then moves forward and pans left, causing the dark structure to move off-screen to the right. This movement reveals a two-story building that now occupies the left and center middle ground, with a soldier lying on the ground before it in the center-left. The player's weapon shifts to the bottom-center foreground. Throughout the shot, a minimap remains in the bottom-left corner and other interface elements are in the bottom-right. The camera is positioned at the character's eye level.",
