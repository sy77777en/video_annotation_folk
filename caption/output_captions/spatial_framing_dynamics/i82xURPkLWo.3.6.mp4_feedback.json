    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a man seated outdoors. The subject occupies the central area of the frame, with his upper body and face clearly visible. Positioned slightly to the left, he remains in the foreground throughout the video. The rustic wooden structure forms the background, extending across the top and right portions of the frame, while some greenery is visible further back, suggesting a rural setting. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's eye level, capturing his facial expressions and slight head movements as he speaks. Initially, his expression is subtle, and he looks slightly downward. As the video progresses, he raises his hand briefly to touch his face before lowering it again, maintaining his gaze downward. The spatial arrangement remains consistent, with the subject consistently centered and the background elements static. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera angle during the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a darker skin tone, a buzz cut hairstyle, and a neatly trimmed goatee. He is wearing a brown t-shirt and is seated, facing slightly to his left. His expression changes as he speaks, transitioning from a subtle smile to a more contemplative look, while he appears to be looking slightly downward. The setting suggests a relaxed, informal environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting with a rustic, weathered wooden structure in the background, featuring vertical planks and a few windows. The environment suggests a rural or countryside location, with natural light indicating daytime. The scene includes a person seated, wearing a brown shirt, with a relaxed demeanor. The texture of the wooden structure is rough, with visible grain and signs of aging. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with muted colors and a focus on the simplicity of the surroundings.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
