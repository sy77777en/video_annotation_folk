    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A cartoon boy with brown, spiky hair, a dark top, and light-colored pants is shown in two distinct states. In both states, he remains a solid figure, with the second state featuring motion blur due to fast-paced movement. The scene also features wooden platforms and ladders, some decorated with green vines. A cannon device with a fuse hangs from a rope. In the top left corner, two almost square outlines are visible, one with a pattern and one hollow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is an outdoor, jungle-like canyon with a brightly lit, hazy yellow background rendered in a painted style. The environment consists of multiple levels of wooden platforms constructed from brown logs and adorned with green vines. Some platforms have blue vertical interiors visible through slats, and they are connected by green, vine-like ladders. The ground below the platforms is covered with green ferns and spikes. An artillery device with a fuse is in the upper portion of the scene. An overlay in the top-left corner displays two almost square outlines, one with a pattern and one hollow.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot captured from a side-view, level perspective, a cartoon boy with an atypical, solid form stands on a central, middle-ground wooden platform. This platform is flanked by two green, vine-like ladders that descend to a lower, foreground platform spanning the bottom of the frame. Another wooden platform is positioned in the top left of the middle ground, while a cannon-like device hangs from a rope in the top center. The background consists of a hazy, yellow, painted canyon. The boy jumps down and to the left, then moves rapidly across the bottom platform to the left, his form blurring with motion. The camera remains static throughout the action, with two UI elements overlaid in the top left corner of the frame.",
