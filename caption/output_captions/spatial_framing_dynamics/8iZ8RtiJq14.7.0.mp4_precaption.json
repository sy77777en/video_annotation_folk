    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A faceless, mannequin-like humanoid figure is depicted from the chest up, sitting down. The figure has a smooth, reflective, and featureless white surface, with a bright highlight on the top of its head. It appears to be wearing a collared shirt and a tie, which are depicted with a less reflective texture compared to its body. The figure is illuminated by a strong blue and teal light and holds its left hand up in front of its torso.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a faceless, mannequin-like figure wearing a collared shirt and tie is seated on a couch. The entire scene is bathed in a strong teal and blue light, creating a hazy, atmospheric effect in the background. The figure has a smooth, featureless head that reflects a bright spot of light. Soft pillows are visible on the couch behind the figure.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a faceless humanoid figure is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Behind the figure, a couch with pillows is visible in the middle ground, spanning from the left to the right side of the frame. The background is filled with a hazy, teal-colored atmosphere. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, performs a very slow and subtle dolly-in, causing the figure to gradually grow slightly larger within the frame.",
