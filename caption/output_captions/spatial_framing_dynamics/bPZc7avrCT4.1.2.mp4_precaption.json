    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with light skin, wearing a red shirt, holds a yellow and black chainsaw horizontally by its black handle. The chainsaw has a \"POWER 50cc\" sticker on its yellow motor housing and a long, black bar with a visible chain. A translucent, spherical water balloon, which contains a smaller, inner purple balloon, falls onto the moving chain of the saw. Upon impact, the outer balloon bursts in slow motion, sending a spray of clear water outward. The inner purple balloon is then shredded by the chain, releasing a vibrant cloud of green liquid that mixes with the water as torn pieces of the balloon are flung away.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting with a blurred background of green foliage, a person holds a yellow and black chainsaw horizontally. A translucent water balloon, containing a smaller purple balloon inside, descends onto the chainsaw's moving blade. Upon impact, the outer balloon bursts in slow motion, initially spraying clear water. This is immediately followed by an eruption of green powder that mixes with the water, creating a colorful splash that expands outward from the point of contact on the blade.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a chainsaw is held horizontally, occupying the middle ground from the left side of the frame to the right. A translucent water balloon, containing a smaller purple balloon, enters from the top center and descends vertically toward the middle of the chainsaw's bar. Upon impact, the balloon bursts in slow motion, sending a spray of clear water and a cloud of green liquid expanding outward from the center of the frame, while torn pieces of the balloon are flung away. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the subject's level.",
