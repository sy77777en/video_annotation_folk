    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a low-angle medium shot centered on a patch of grass and wildflowers in the foreground, with the lower bodies of passengers framing the scene on the left, right, and top. The camera then tilts up while pulling back, transitioning into a wide shot that reveals the entire subway car. In this composition, the patch of nature extends from the foreground to the middle ground in the center of the frame. Passengers are positioned along the left and right sides, occupying the foreground, middle ground, and background. The shot culminates in a rapid backward dolly zoom, which creates a strong motion blur effect, causing the flowers in the foreground to streak across the frame while the passengers and the car's interior recede into a blurred central point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The floor of a crowded subway car is covered in a patch of green grass interspersed with small white, purple, and yellow wildflowers, among which small butterflies fly. A diverse group of male and female passengers of various ages are positioned around this patch of nature. In the center of the car, a man with short hair, wearing blue overalls with a dark jacket, stands holding onto an overhead pole. To the right, a man with a dark beard, glasses, and a red beanie sits reading a book. Other passengers are seen in various poses: some sit on the blue subway seats, looking at their phones or reading, while others stand. Their clothing is casual, including a person in a green jacket, another in a brown coat, and a woman in a black top. One person sitting on the left wears a long skirt and has tan shoes resting near the grassy area. The passengers occupy the space around the central patch of grass, creating a contrast between the urban setting and the natural elements on the floor.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a subway car where a patch of green grass with small white, blue, and purple wildflowers grows directly on the checkered floor. Passengers are seated on blue benches and standing, holding onto metal handrails, positioned around the central patch of nature. The interior of the car features colorful panels on the upper walls. The perspective begins at hip level, descends lower in the subsequent movement, pulls back to a wider view of the entire car, and then transitions into a fast, blurred backward motion through the space.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a crowded subway with flowers and plants covering the floor. It begins with a shot of some flowers and plants on the subway floor, along with the lower bodies of people around. The camera then tilts up and moves back, revealing more people in full bodies and the plants growing on the subway floor, with butterflies flying. In the final shot, most of the frame is obscured by the plants, leaving only a small portion of the subway visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
