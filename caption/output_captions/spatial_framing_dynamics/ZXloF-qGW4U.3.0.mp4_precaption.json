    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on a dark view through a doorway, looking into a long hallway bathed in intense pink and purple light. A silhouetted figure of a woman with long hair is revealed standing at the far end of the hall. She appears to be wearing a jacket and high-heeled shoes. As the video progresses, she slowly walks into view, emerging from the left of the door into the center of the doorway, her form remaining a dark silhouette against the vibrant, colored light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Viewed from between two dark structures resembling the sides of a doorframe with an arched top, a long, narrow hallway stretches into the distance. The corridor is bathed in a deep magenta and purple glow emanating from unseen sources and a bright light fixture at the far end. This intense lighting casts a red reflection on the polished floor. At the end of the hall, a silhouetted figure stands near a table. Above the table, a glowing, geometric object, appearing to be a purple light fixture, hangs from the ceiling. Additionally, there is a purple light in the ceiling of the room where the silhouetted figure is located.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The shot begins framed by two dark vertical structures in the foreground, creating a view through a central doorway into a long hallway that occupies the middle ground and background. Initially, a silhouetted figure of a woman is visible standing statically in the background at the far center of the hall. As the video progresses, the woman walks from the background toward the middle ground, emerging from the left side of the doorway's opening and moving to the center of the frame. This movement transitions the scene into a full shot of the subject. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
