    "pre_caption": "A wide shot captures a curved section of a red running track, which fills the foreground and middle ground, sweeping from the bottom right towards the center-left. In the middle ground, several male runners are positioned on the right side of the frame, moving along the track's curve toward the left. An official stands stationary in the middle ground on the right, inside the track's curve. The background is occupied by multi-tiered spectator stands that fill the upper half of the frame. Advertising banners are visible in the middle ground along the inner edge of the track. A scoreboard is positioned in the top left corner, and an event logo is in the top right corner. The camera is static and positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **On a red running track inside a stadium, several men are running around a curve. The lead runner is a medium-skinned man with dark hair and a beard, wearing a blue tank top and matching blue shorts. Following him is a light-skinned man with short dark hair, dressed in a white tank top and blue shorts. The third runner is a dark-skinned man with short dark hair, wearing a yellow and black tank top and black shorts. A fourth runner, a dark-skinned man in a red tank top and red shorts, trails behind them. Many other runners are also on the track. Standing on the infield to the right, a dark-skinned man in a white short-sleeved shirt, a white cap, and dark pants observes the race.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place at a large athletics stadium, showing a wide view of a curved section of a red running track with white lane markings. In the middle ground and background, multi-tiered spectator stands are filled with a crowd. Along the inner edge of the track, advertising banners for sponsors such as Seiko, Asics, TDK, and QNB are visible. Near the track, there are a few orange cones and some athletic equipment. In the upper left corner of the screen, a scoreboard with country flags and rankings is visible, while the upper right features the logo for the \"IAAF World Athletics Championships DOHA 2019.\" Several athletes are running along the bend of the track.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
