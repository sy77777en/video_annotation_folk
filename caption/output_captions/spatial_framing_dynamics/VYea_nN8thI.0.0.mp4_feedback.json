    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot from a high angle, a red car is centered in the frame, located in the middle ground. It drives away from the camera along a highway that stretches from the bottom center of the frame towards a vanishing point at the top. The highway is flanked on the left and right by a body of water that curves steeply upward. As the camera tracks forward, the car remains centered while moving further into the background up the incline. A text overlay is fixed in the foreground across the bottom of the screen, with text on the bottom left and an icon on the bottom right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A red sedan is shown in a digitally manipulated scene where the ocean curves upward around a right-angled highway. The camera smoothly tracks the red car from above and behind, starting from an almost bird\u2019s-eye view and moving downward and forward. Overlaid at the bottom of the scene is white text that reads \"CHARGES WHEN YOU PLUG-IN\" in a blocky, digital-style font with a slight glitch effect. To the right of the text is a white outline of a charging plug with a segment of wire.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a digitally altered scene featuring a right-angled highway extending over a vast body of rippling water during the daytime. The camera consistently focuses on a single red car, maintaining a smooth tracking motion from above and behind, transitioning from a bird\u2019s-eye view to a more forward angle. The two-lane highway, marked with yellow lines, curves upward, with the red car driving along the right side, ascending the steep incline. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays the text \"CHARGES WHEN YOU PLUG-IN\" in a white, blocky font. To the right of the text is a white outline of a charging plug with a segment of wire.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
