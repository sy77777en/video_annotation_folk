    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, captured from the subject's height, initially frames a pixelated character in the center-left middle ground, running rightwards along a dark purple bridge that extends horizontally across the scene. To the left of the character in the middle ground, a glowing blue potion on a platform and three hanging chains are visible. A large, luminous full moon occupies the top-left to top-center background, set against a teal and purple star-speckled sky featuring a distant nebula; large, dark, silhouetted tree-like structures are also in the background on the left. As the character moves, the camera pans right, keeping the character in the middle ground. Consequently, the potion, its platform, and the chains on the left exit the frame. A blue vertical beam of light momentarily emerges from beneath the character in the center middle ground, from which a bat-shaped bird flies upwards. By the end of the pan, the character is positioned on the center-right of the bridge, near chemistry lab equipment that has entered the frame from the right, also in the middle ground. The moon shifts to the top-center and top-right background. Throughout the sequence, various HUD elements, including ability icons, health bars, resource counters, and a mini-map, remain static in the foreground at the bottom left, bottom center, and bottom right of the screen, while dark, indistinct structures and hanging vines are consistently present in the foreground and middle ground below the bridge.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pixelated character, appearing as a humanoid figure, is running towards the right side of the frame. The character's face features a yellow cross-shaped design, likely representing its eye. The upper body is clad in a yellow-green garment, possibly armor, while the lower body is wearing red pants. As the character runs, two red and yellow striped ribbons trail behind from the neck area. As it crosses a bridge, a blue vertical beam of light emerges from beneath its feet, from which a bat-shaped bird flies out. On the left side of the frame, a blue, glowing potion in a clear, round-bottomed flask gradually disappears. Meanwhile, on the right side of the frame, a table with a set of chemistry lab equipment appears. At the bottom left of the screen, several square icons are displayed: one depicts a blue, jagged, lightning-like symbol; another shows a blue, swirling, windy pattern; a third features a stylized, brown and white owl's head; and a fourth displays a purple crossbow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a side-view perspective of the character shows an outdoor scene at night. A large, luminous full moon dominates the teal and purple, star-speckled sky, which also features a distant, bright, nebula-like formation. Dark, silhouetted, large tree-like structures are visible in the background. The foreground features a dark purple, metallic-looking bridge or walkway with a simple railing, upon which a small, pixelated character in a red cloak, with glowing yellow eyes, is running. Below the bridge, dark, indistinct structures and hanging vines are present. To the left of the bridge, there are three metal chains hanging down and a room resembling ruins, which disappear from the frame as the camera moves right with the character. On the right side of the frame and bridge, there is a chemical experiment apparatus. Overlay elements include a heads-up display at the bottom of the screen showing ability icons (a blue shuriken, a green lightning bolt, an owl, a purple crossbow), a green health bar, and numerical resource counters. In the bottom center is a larger health bar (2879/6427). The bottom right displays icons for a green key, a brown block, a blue gem (103), and an orange coin (327), along with a timer (around 40m 04s), a number 5, and a mini-map depicting a red room with a blue arrow indicating the character's position.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
