    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot of a Japanese street corner. Initially, a red taxi is in the center middle ground, driving from right to left on a road that occupies the lower half of the frame. A dark pole stands in the left foreground. In the background, a green hedge lines the road, with a mix of traditional and modern buildings and trees behind it. The camera pans left, following the red taxi as it moves to the left side of the frame, which brings a black car and a white car into view in the middle ground. The camera then tilts upward, causing the street to move to the bottom of the frame and bringing a large blue overhead road sign into the center. The final shot frames the sign in the upper half, with the tops of the background buildings below it and a cloudy blue sky filling the top. The camera is positioned at eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot from a street corner in Japan under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. A red taxi drives along a paved road lined with green hedges and trees, while a white truck is parked on the roadside in the background. Modern apartment buildings and traditional Japanese-style structures are visible in the background. As the camera pans left to follow the red taxi, a black sedan and a white car come into view, trailing behind the taxi. The camera then tilts upward to focus on a large blue overhead road sign, which provides directions in both Japanese and English for destinations such as Otsu, Yamashinahigashino, and Shimogamo, along with route numbers. The focus of the shot is on the overall urban environment and the sense of place, rather than on any single vehicle or building. The camera's upward movement from the bustling street to the directional sign emphasizes the location and atmosphere of this specific intersection.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A daytime street scene unfolds in a Japanese city under a bright blue sky with large, white, puffy clouds. On a paved two-way road, a red and white taxi drives from right to left. The street is lined with a manicured green hedge, which partially obstructs the view of oncoming vehicles. As the camera pans left to follow the red taxi, a black car and a white car become visible, driving behind it. Behind the hedge stand a mix of buildings, including a one-story restaurant with a green tiled roof and modern, multi-story grey and white structures. The view tilts upward, revealing a large blue overhead road sign with white Japanese and English lettering, indicating directions and route numbers against the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
