A text overlay is superimposed in the bottom-left corner of the frame, while another text overlay appears in the top-right area. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An older, white-haired man with light skin is on the left, smiling broadly. He wears a black suit jacket over a light-colored collared shirt. A text overlay identifies him as \"Richard H. Thaler, PhD.\" To his right, a young woman with long, dark brown hair and tan skin also smiles. She is wearing a black top, and a text overlay identifies her as \"Selena Gomez.\" In the blurred background between them, another woman in a leopard-print top holds a glass.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at a crowded indoor social gathering, likely a party or reception. In the foreground, a man with white hair wearing a dark suit jacket and a woman with dark brown, styled hair are seen smiling. Other attendees are visible in the blurred background, with one woman wearing a leopard-print top and holding a drink. White text overlays are superimposed on the video. In the lower-left corner, text identifies \"Richard H. Thaler, PhD\" and lists his professional credentials, including \"Father of 'Behavioral Economics'\". In the upper-right area, another overlay identifies \"Selena Gomez, International Pop Star\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
