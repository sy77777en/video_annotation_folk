    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on how much of the subject is visible. \n\nNext, describe the **subjects and elements\u2019 position in the video**. Indicate their approximate location within the frame, such as **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right,top left, centre**. Describe their depth in the scene, such as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Try to analyze as many elements as you can see.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end of  this text.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes within the frame, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.  \n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not comprehensively capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the spatial framing and dynamics in this video. This caption is only to help you learn the video thoroughly, so don't rely on it too much. Focus on the Spatial framing and dynamics caption.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a close-up of a textured piece of wood as a long-legged insect with a black body and orange markings enters the frame and moves across the surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a close-up of a wooden branch on a sunny, rocky ground. It is outside, probably at a beach or in a dry area. The bright sunlight suggests it is midday. The scene is still, focusing on the patterns and textures of the branch and nearby pebbles. The atmosphere is calm and peaceful, highlighting the natural details.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video shows a full shot of an insect crawling on wood. Initially, only the wood is visible, then the bug enters from the top left, moves to the right, and eventually exits the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a full shot of a textured wooden branch positioned diagonally across the frame, extending from the bottom left to the top right. The branch is in the foreground, with a rocky, sunlit background suggesting an outdoor setting. Initially, the scene focuses solely on the wood's texture. A long-legged insect with a black body and orange markings enters from the top left, moving across the branch towards the right. The insect's movement is captured at the same level as the wood, maintaining the camera's overhead perspective. The insect traverses the surface, highlighting the wood's intricate details before exiting the frame. The camera remains steady throughout, emphasizing the natural textures and the insect's path.",
