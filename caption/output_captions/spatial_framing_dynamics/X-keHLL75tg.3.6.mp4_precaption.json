    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, dark brown hair and a light to medium skin tone sits on the right side of the frame, facing left. She is wearing a white, short-sleeved collared shirt and is seen brushing her hair with both hands. To her left, a shirtless man with longish dark hair, a light skin tone, and a lean build sits up in bed, leaning against pillows. He has visible chest hair, a tattoo on his left pectoral muscle, and another on his left arm. A light-colored blanket covers him from the waist down. The man is looking at and speaking to the woman, who is listening to him. Both individuals are wearing rings on their right hands.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a bedroom with soft, warm lighting. A bed with light-colored sheets and a grey blanket is positioned against a plain, light-colored wall. The bed has a dark, upholstered headboard, and several pillows are propped against it, including some with a textured cream fabric and a solid grey one. A shirtless man with a tattoo on his chest sits up in the bed, while a woman in a white shirt sits on the edge, facing him.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video shows a woman sitting at the foot of the bed, brushing her hair, while a topless man sits on the bed. In the foreground, the woman is shown in a medium close-up shot on the right side of the frame, slightly blurred. The man is in the middleground, positioned on the left, clearly visible in a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static shot featuring two subjects in a bedroom. In the foreground, a woman is framed in a medium close-up on the right side of the frame, slightly out of focus. In the middle ground, a man is captured in a medium shot on the left, sitting up in a bed that extends across the lower half of the frame. The man is positioned in front of several pillows and a dark headboard, with a plain wall visible in the background. The camera remains stationary at the subjects' level throughout the scene.",
