    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit setting, a young woman with dark hair is lying in bed, viewed from the side. She is propped up and holds a smartphone in her left hand, looking at the screen. The phone's display is illuminated, showing a close-up image of another person's face. The woman in bed is wearing a light-colored top, and while her features are partially obscured by shadow, some details are visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit bedroom at night. A person, whose features are obscured in shadow, lies in bed while holding up a smartphone. The screen of the phone displays an open camera app, capturing subtle movements. In the softly blurred background, a single lamp emits a warm glow, serving as the primary light source and casting gentle illumination over a shelf cluttered with numerous indistinct, colorful objects.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a silhouetted woman is positioned in the foreground, occupying the left and bottom of the frame as she lies down. She holds a smartphone up in the middle ground, located in the top-center of the frame, with its illuminated screen visible. In the background, a blurry shelf fills the right side of the composition. The woman's head shifts slightly downward during the shot, but the camera remains static and positioned at her level.",
