    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man is depicted sitting at a desk, leaning forward. He is wearing a blue, short-sleeved, collared shirt and a blue baseball cap with a white triangular logo on the front. Both of his hands are on his head, clutching the cap. His face is creased with furrowed brows and a downturned mouth as he looks down and to his right at a partially unrolled sheet of paper on the desk before him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This animated scene is set in a dimly lit room, possibly an office or control room. In the foreground, a light-brown desk holds a few sheets of white paper. The background consists of shelving units; the one on the left contains several dark, screen-like objects, while the wall on the right features a built-in console with various slots and panels. The overall color palette is composed of muted blues and warm browns, rendered in a hand-drawn style with prominent black outlines. The shot slowly zooms in toward the papers on the desk.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.",
    "pre_caption": "This animated scene begins with a medium close-up of a man positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene. In the foreground, a desk with papers occupies the bottom portion of the frame. The background contains shelving units on the left and a console on the right. The camera, positioned at the man's height, slowly pushes in and tilts down, shifting the focus toward the papers in the bottom right foreground.",
