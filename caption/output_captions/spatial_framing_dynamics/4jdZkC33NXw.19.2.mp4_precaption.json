    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a streetscape scenery shot of a quiet suburban road in Japan on a rainy day. The focus is on capturing the overall atmosphere and environment rather than a specific subject, with the wide, stationary perspective allowing the viewer to take in the entire scene. In the foreground, a lush flowerbed filled with bright yellow and purple blossoms lines a wide, paved sidewalk, contrasting with the grey, wet conditions. Cars travel along the wet, two-lane road, which is flanked by residential houses and some commercial buildings. In the distance, the distinctive netting of a large golf driving range stands out against the cloudy sky, with a complex web of power lines overhead, contributing to the tranquil, everyday ambiance of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot captures a rainy day on a street in a Japanese suburb. From a paved sidewalk, the view looks across a flower bed filled with yellow and purple blossoms towards a wet, two-lane road where cars are driving. The pavement is dark from the rain under an overcast sky. In the background, residential houses with tiled roofs, numerous overhead power lines, and a large, netted structure resembling a golf driving range are visible. A blue and white sign with Japanese characters is attached to a building on the right. A black lamppost stands in the flower bed, and green trees and shrubbery line the roadside.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a stationary wide shot of a suburban street scene, captured from an eye-level perspective. In the foreground, a paved sidewalk occupies the bottom left, while a flowerbed with yellow and purple flowers extends from the bottom right across the lower portion of the frame, with a black lamppost positioned in the center-right. The middle ground is dominated by a wet, two-lane road that curves from the right side of the frame towards the center-left, where cars are seen driving. This road is flanked by residential buildings, trees, and a small traffic island in the center-left. In the background, a large, netted golf driving range is visible in the center, with more houses and a dense network of power lines filling the upper portion of the frame against a cloudy sky. A blue and white sign is attached to a building in the top right.",
