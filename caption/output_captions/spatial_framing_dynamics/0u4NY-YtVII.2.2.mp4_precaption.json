    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a top-down aerial scenery shot of a bustling container port, where rows upon rows of multi-colored shipping containers are stacked high, creating a vibrant, geometric pattern. The containers, in shades of red, green, blue, white, and yellow, are separated into massive blocks, divided by wide concrete lanes where trucks with white and red trailers maneuver. Large gantry cranes are positioned over the stacks, ready to move the cargo. There is no single main subject, as the high vantage point is used to emphasize the immense scale and organized complexity of the logistics hub, focusing on the overall environment and atmosphere rather than any specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a top-down view of a container port during the day. Long, neat rows of colorful shipping containers are stacked high, with reds, greens, blues, whites, and yellows mixed randomly. Between the stacks are gray, paved lanes where a few semi-trucks, one white and one red, are seen maneuvering. Large, blue and yellow gantry cranes straddle some of the container rows. A small, white overlay of the number \"[2]\" in brackets is visible in the bottom-left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static, extreme wide scenery shot filmed from a high-angle, top-down perspective. The frame is dominated by vertical columns of stacked, multi-colored shipping containers that occupy the left, center, and right portions of the scene. These columns are separated by three vertical concrete lanes. In the wide central lane, a white truck and a red truck are positioned near the center of the frame. Gantry cranes are visible straddling the container stacks on the far left and far right. A small, white text overlay is fixed in the bottom-left corner. The camera remains stationary, looking directly down upon the entire scene.",
