    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a young woman with light skin and dark braided hair, wearing a light-colored dress with short sleeves and a fitted waist, carrying a large rectangular suitcase in one hand and a smaller bag on her other arm. She is shown walking and gradually coming into view, moving past a wooden fence. She frequently lowers her head to look at the ground, and her steps are unsteady. When she turns her face toward her right side at the end, her facial expression appears nervous. The scene emphasizes her emergence in front of the center of the fence, with her clothing and belongings clearly visible as she is revealed.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor rural setting with a wooden fence in the foreground, constructed from rough, weathered planks and posts, some of which are angled and uneven. Beyond the fence, several farm buildings with pitched roofs and simple wooden siding are visible, spaced across a flat expanse of land. The sky is dark and overcast, with heavy clouds and a visible tornado funnel extending from the clouds to the ground, creating a dramatic and tense atmosphere. The ground appears dry and textured, with patches of grass and dirt. A person carrying a bag and a suitcase enters from the right foreground, moving toward the center-left foreground. The overall color scheme is monochromatic, dominated by sepia tones, giving the scene a vintage appearance. There are no overlay elements such as text or icons present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a wide shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a rural landscape, showing a wooden fence spanning the lower foreground of the frame, with farm buildings and a tornado in the background. Initially, no major subject is present, and the scenery fills the frame, with the fence occupying the bottom and middle ground, and the buildings and tornado positioned in the center and background. As the shot progresses, a young woman enters from the right foreground, carrying a suitcase and a bag, and walks toward the center-left foreground, gradually becoming the main subject. She remains in the foreground, with her full figure visible, while the fence stays in the lower foreground and the farm buildings and tornado remain in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject\u2019s height throughout, maintaining a level perspective as she moves across the frame. There are no significant changes in camera angle or height, and the spatial relationship between the subject, fence, and background elements remains consistent as the woman moves into view.",
