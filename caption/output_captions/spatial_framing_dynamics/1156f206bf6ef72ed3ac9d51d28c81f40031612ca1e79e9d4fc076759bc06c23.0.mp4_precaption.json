    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with medium-length dark hair, wearing a sleeveless top. She is illuminated by colorful lights, including red, green, and purple hues, which create dynamic patterns on her skin and clothing. Her profile is visible as she moves, and the lighting emphasizes her facial features and the contours of her body. The vibrant lights and her movement suggest a lively atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a dark, indoor environment against a black background. The space is illuminated by dynamic, colored lights that shift between red, green, and purple. These lights move across the scene, briefly highlighting a woman with medium-length dark hair worn down who is dancing. Her form is visible in profile and from behind, silhouetted by the moving illumination.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium close-up shot captures a woman in the middle ground, positioned slightly right of center against a dark background. Initially, she is seen from behind, but she turns her head to reveal her profile while remaining in the same area of the frame. She then raises her arms, which move in and out of the top of the frame. Throughout the shot, the camera remains stationary and at the subject's level.",
