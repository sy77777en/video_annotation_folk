    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a wooden table with a smooth, polished surface. Initially, two sheets of white paper with handwritten text are visible on the left side of the table. As the camera moves backward slightly, two additional sheets on the right become visible, revealing a total of four sheets of paper. The focus is on the papers and their arrangement on the table.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting, a camera pans slowly to the right across the surface of a brown wooden table. Several rectangular white sheets of paper, covered in what appears to be typed text, are laid out in a neat row on the table's surface. The background is pitch black, with a white object, possibly a radiator, in the upper left corner, drawing attention to the papers on the brightly lit tabletop.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects. \n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide, high-angle shot, the scene initially frames a wooden table that occupies the foreground and middle ground, extending diagonally from the bottom left to the top right. Two white sheets of paper are positioned in the left and center middle ground on the table's surface. In the top left background, a white radiator is partially visible against a black background that fills the top portion of the frame. The camera then slowly pans to the right, revealing two more sheets of paper on the right side of the table. This movement shifts the initial two sheets toward the left of the frame, resulting in a final composition where four sheets of paper are arranged in a horizontal row across the middle ground.",
