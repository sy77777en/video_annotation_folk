    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot featuring a wide, gently flowing river bordered by rocky banks and lush green vegetation, with distant hills and mountains rising under a clear blue sky dotted with large, billowing white clouds. The focus is on the expansive natural environment, emphasizing the scale and tranquility of the river and its surroundings rather than highlighting any specific object or individual. There is no main subject because the intent is to capture the atmosphere and beauty of the landscape as a whole, inviting viewers to appreciate the serene and unspoiled character of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows an outdoor riverside landscape during the day, with clear blue skies and scattered white clouds overhead. The river flows steadily, its surface rippling and foaming over rocks, bordered by a wide stretch of smooth, gray stones and pebbles. Dense green trees line the banks, and beyond them, low hills and forested mountains rise in the background. The sunlight casts even illumination across the scene, highlighting the natural textures of water, rocks, and foliage. No overlays or artificial elements are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture the entire landscape, with the river occupying the center and lower part of the frame in the foreground and middle ground, bordered by rocky banks that extend from the bottom left and right edges toward the center. Dense green trees line both sides of the river in the middle ground, stretching horizontally across the frame, while hills and mountains rise in the background, occupying the upper third of the frame. The sky fills the top portion of the frame, with clouds spread across the upper background. The camera is positioned at a low height, close to the river\u2019s surface, providing a slightly elevated but mostly level perspective relative to the water. There are no major subjects or individuals, and the spatial composition remains stable, emphasizing the depth and scale of the natural environment without significant movement or changes in framing.",
