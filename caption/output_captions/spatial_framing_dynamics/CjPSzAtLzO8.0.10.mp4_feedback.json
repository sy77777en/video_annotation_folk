    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a high-angle full shot of a motorcyclist positioned in the center foreground, leaning into a turn on a racetrack. A second motorcyclist is partially visible in the top center of the frame, located in the middle ground. The camera then pulls up and away, transitioning to an extreme wide shot. In the final composition, the first motorcyclist is in the bottom center of the frame, and the second motorcyclist is in the top center, both now situated in the middle ground as they ride down a straightaway. The racetrack extends from the bottom to the top of the frame, with the surrounding desert landscape visible on both sides.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two people are seen riding motorcycles on a racetrack. The person in the foreground wears a full-body racing suit that is predominantly blue with red sections on the shoulders and lower back, and white accents. The word \"Alpinestars\" is visible on the back of the suit. This rider's helmet is decorated with a red, white, and blue American flag-style design. Following behind is a second person, also in a full-body racing suit, which is primarily blue and white, paired with a matching helmet. Both individuals are leaning deeply into a turn.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures two motorcyclists on a paved racetrack located in a dry, desert landscape. The dark asphalt track is bordered by light-brown sand and dirt, with a distant mountain range visible on the horizon under a clear sky. The bright sun casts long, dark shadows of the riders and their motorcycles onto the pavement as they navigate a turn and proceed down a straightaway.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
