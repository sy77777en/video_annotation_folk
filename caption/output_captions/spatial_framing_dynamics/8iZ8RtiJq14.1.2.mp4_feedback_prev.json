    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, where a miniature McDonald's restaurant model is positioned in the center middle ground. To its left in the middle ground stands a tall McDonald's \"M\" signpost. Oversized replicas of french fries and a drink cup are located slightly behind the restaurant, in the center-right and center-left middle ground, respectively. A \"50 MILLION PRIZES\" sign is visible to the right in the middle ground. The board game surface itself occupies the foreground and middle ground, with small figurines scattered across it. Green hills form the background at the top of the frame. As the camera pulls back and rises, the scene transitions to a full shot. In this wider view, the entire board-game-like town becomes the central focal point, now more distinctly in the middle ground, surrounded by the expansive green hills and a pale, purplish sky in the background. A white picket fence appears in the far-right background. The camera remains positioned above the subject throughout this transition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The camera is positioned high above the scene at the beginning. The video displays a miniature diorama representing a McDonald's-themed town, designed to resemble a board game. Central to this diorama is a model of a McDonald's restaurant featuring a brown, sloped roof and the \"McDonald's\" name visible on its facade. Adjacent to the restaurant stands a tall, red rectangular signpost topped with the iconic golden yellow \"M\" logo. Prominently featured within the diorama are oversized replicas of McDonald's food items: a large red carton filled with yellow french fries, marked with a yellow \"M,\" and a large drink cup, primarily white with red and yellow accents. Another smaller, upright sign, appearing red and white with the number \"50\" and text, is also visible. As the camera zooms out, more of the landscape comes into view. Several small, indistinct human-like figurines are scattered throughout the scene, some posed as if walking. The entire setup is laid out on a flat surface divided into squares and paths, characteristic of a board game, with additional small, dark green block-like structures and a small, dark, car-like object populating the miniature landscape. Surrounding the chessboard are green trees and rolling hills.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows a miniature, stylized outdoor scene depicting a McDonald's-themed board game. The game board, featuring light-colored squares and pathways, is set against a backdrop of rolling green hills under a pale, purplish sky, suggesting daytime or dusk. Prominent visual elements include a miniature McDonald's restaurant with a brown roof and yellow arches, a tall red sign with the yellow McDonald's \"M\" logo, and oversized representations of a McDonald's drink cup and a red box of french fries. Another sign, predominantly red and yellow with black lettering, displays the text \"50 MILLION PRIZES.\" Small, indistinct figures are positioned on the game board. A white picket fence is visible in the distance along the edge of the green hills.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video opens with a medium shot of a board-game-like McDonald's town. As the camera pulls back and rises into a full shot, the board-game-like town becomes the focal point, set against the hills.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
