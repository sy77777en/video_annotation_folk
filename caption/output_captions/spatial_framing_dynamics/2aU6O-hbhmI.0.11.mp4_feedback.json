    "pre_caption": "The video features an extreme wide shot of a sprawling urban landscape during sunset. The camera captures the entire cityscape, with numerous high-rise buildings and construction cranes filling the frame. Initially, the cranes are positioned towards the top right and center of the frame, dominating the upper portion of the scene in the foreground and middle ground. As the camera pans, the cranes shift from the right side to the left, maintaining their prominence in the foreground. The high-rise buildings are scattered throughout the frame, occupying the middle ground and background, with some structures appearing closer to the camera in the foreground. The sky, painted with hues of pink and orange, forms the backdrop, situated at the top of the frame. The camera maintains a high vantage point, positioned above the buildings and cranes, providing a comprehensive aerial view of the city. The transition from one side of the frame to the other is smooth, with the camera panning horizontally while keeping the same height and angle relative to the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a sprawling urban environment at sunset with a focus on the skyline and the interplay of natural and artificial light. The scene includes numerous high-rise buildings, construction cranes, and a sky illuminated by the setting sun. The emphasis is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the city rather than any specific object, highlighting the expansive nature of the urban landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a drone POV showing an aerial view of an urban landscape at sunset. The setting is outdoors, featuring a cityscape with numerous high-rise buildings and construction cranes. The sky is a blend of soft pink and orange hues, indicating the time of day as evening. The buildings are primarily modern, with glass facades reflecting the warm colors of the sunset. Construction cranes are prominent, with their metallic structures silhouetted against the sky. The city is bustling, with visible streets and illuminated windows suggesting activity. The overall scene captures the dynamic and evolving nature of the urban environment as day transitions to night.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
