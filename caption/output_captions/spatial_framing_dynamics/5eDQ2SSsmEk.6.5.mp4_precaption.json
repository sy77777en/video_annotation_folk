    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a moody cityscape scenery shot viewed from the interior of a car on a rainy night. The scene is bathed in a deep, cinematic blue light, with a doorway emitting faint red light inside. Through the rain-streaked windshield, the outside world is blurred and obscured, revealing only a machine, which appears to be an illuminated payphone or ATM, on the left. There is no main subject, as the focus is on establishing a somber and mysterious atmosphere. The obscured view, the dark, color-saturated lighting, and the rain work together to create a sense of isolation and suspense within the urban environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From inside a vehicle on a rainy night, the view is seen through a side window covered in water droplets. The exterior scene is cast in a blue light, illuminating a vertical, box-like terminal resembling a payphone. Faint red light is visible inside a doorway in the background, and the dark silhouette of the car's interior frames the blurry, nocturnal view. The rain on the glass distorts the outside world.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This static video presents a close-up scenery shot from the perspective of someone inside a vehicle. The dark silhouette of the car's interior frames the view from the bottom right foreground. The scene is viewed through a rain-streaked window that occupies the majority of the frame in the middle ground. In the background, an illuminated, vertical machine is positioned on the left, while a faint red light emanates from a structure in the center-left. The composition creates a sense of depth through these layers, with the camera positioned at an eye-level height from a seated position, looking out at the nocturnal environment.",
