    "pre_caption": "This medium shot frames a puppet-like girl on the right side in the middle ground, initially looking towards the top left. Piles of folded fabrics are prominent in the foreground and middle ground on the left; a blue and white floral patterned fabric is in the bottom left foreground, while a bright green fabric rests atop other textiles in the left middle ground. A dark trunk is situated in the middle ground, left of center and behind these fabrics. To the girl's left, in the middle ground and right of center, a pink sack-like bundle is visible above a red plastic basket. The background consists of a wooden wall with circular cutouts, seen across the top of the frame. The girl then turns her head slightly downwards and towards her left, her expression changing to a smile, while her body remains largely still. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A puppet-like girl with light skin, an elongated face, and large, wide-set, expressive eyes is shown facing to her left and slightly upwards. Her dark brown hair is styled in two stiff, shiny braids that fall over her shoulders, and she wears a dark blue vest over a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt. In the foreground and midground, there are piles of folded fabrics, including a bright green one and another with a blue and white floral pattern. A dark, possibly wooden or metal, trunk with a visible latch sits behind the fabrics, and further back, a pink, sack-like bundle and a red plastic basket are visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, in a dimly lit, cluttered room. Light filters in from an unseen source, illuminating a wooden wall in the background that features a pattern of circular cutouts. In the foreground and middle ground, various items are piled up, including a dark, possibly wooden or metal, trunk, stacks of folded fabrics in shades of green, patterned blue and white, and multi-colored textiles. A pink fabric bundle and a red plastic basket are also visible among the clutter. A puppet-like girl with brown braided hair, wearing a blue vest over a light-colored shirt, is positioned to the right near the piled items.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
