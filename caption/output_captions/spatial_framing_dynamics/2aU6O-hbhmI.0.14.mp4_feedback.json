    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a cityscape during sunset. The camera captures a broad view of the urban environment, showing tall buildings, construction cranes, and streets. Initially, the camera focuses on a construction site in the foreground, located towards the bottom left of the frame. As the video progresses, the camera pans upwards and to the right, transitioning the construction site from the foreground to the middle ground. The tall buildings with illuminated windows move from the right side of the frame into the center, occupying the middle ground and background. The sky, with its blend of soft blues and warm oranges, remains consistently in the background throughout the video. The camera maintains a high vantage point, positioned above the city, providing a sweeping aerial perspective. The streets and scattered lights appear in the lower part of the frame, enhancing the depth of the scene. The camera's movement creates a dynamic shift in the spatial framing, highlighting various elements of the urban landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures the urban environment with a focus on the architecture and skyline rather than a specific object. The scene includes tall buildings with illuminated windows, construction cranes, and a vibrant sunset sky, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere of the city. The dynamic angles and lighting highlight the bustling and expansive nature of the urban landscape, creating a sense of movement and energy without centering on a single subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of an urban environment during sunset. The setting is outdoors, showcasing a cityscape with a mix of modern high-rise buildings and construction sites. The sky is a blend of soft blues and warm oranges, indicating the transition from day to night. Notable visual elements include cranes and partially constructed structures, suggesting ongoing development. The buildings are primarily glass and steel, reflecting the fading sunlight. Streets below are visible, with scattered lights beginning to illuminate the scene. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, with the drone's movement providing a sweeping perspective of the city's architectural features and the vibrant colors of the sunset.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
