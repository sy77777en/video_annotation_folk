    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person perspective of a person climbing a rocky surface. The individual's hands are visible in the bottom center of the frame, gripping the edge of a large, uneven rock in the foreground. The bright yellow jacket with black and blue accents is prominently visible, contrasting with the gray rocky terrain. The rocky surface extends across the frame, with numerous gray rock fragments scattered in the middle ground. In the background, the view opens up to green valleys and distant cliffs, emphasizing the height and scale of the environment. The camera is positioned at the climber's height, capturing the rugged texture of the rocks and the expansive landscape below. As the video progresses, the hands and jacket remain central, while the rocky terrain and distant scenery shift slightly, indicating the climber's careful navigation of the uneven terrain.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person wearing a bright yellow jacket with black and blue accents, standing on a rocky surface. The individual is seen from a first-person perspective, with their hands gripping the edge of a large, uneven rock. The rocky terrain is composed of numerous gray rock fragments, and near the cliff's edge, a view opens up to the green valleys below. The person's hands are positioned firmly on the rock, suggesting a climbing or balancing activity. The view emphasizes the rugged texture of the rocks and the vibrant color of the jacket, highlighting the contrast between the person and the natural environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, capturing the experience of a person climbing a rugged mountain. The setting is outdoors, high above a rocky landscape, with jagged stone surfaces and loose gravel underfoot. The time of day is likely midday, as the scene is brightly lit with clear visibility. The climber's hands are visible, gripping the rough, textured gray rocks, while a predominantly bright yellow jacket with blue and black striped accents adds a vibrant contrast to the natural backdrop. The expansive view includes distant cliffs and valleys, emphasizing the height and scale of the environment. The scene conveys a sense of motion as the climber carefully navigates the uneven terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
