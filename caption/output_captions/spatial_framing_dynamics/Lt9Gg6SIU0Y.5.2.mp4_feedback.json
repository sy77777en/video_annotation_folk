    "pre_caption": "The video frames a dense field of small, glowing blue dots distributed throughout three-dimensional space, with the majority of dots and connecting lines converging toward a central vanishing point located at the center of the frame and in the background. The dots are dispersed across the entire frame, occupying the left, right, top, and bottom edges, and extend from the foreground through the middle ground to the background, creating a tunnel-like effect. Faint linear connections between the dots radiate outward from the central point, reinforcing the sense of depth and perspective. The camera appears to be positioned at the same height as the central vanishing point, looking directly toward it, which emphasizes the symmetrical arrangement and the receding lines. As the video progresses, the dots and lines shift slightly, maintaining their overall radial organization while enhancing the impression of continuous movement through the abstract digital space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a dense array of small, glowing blue dots arranged in three-dimensional space, forming lines and patterns that converge toward a central vanishing point. The dots vary slightly in size and brightness, creating a sense of depth and perspective. The overall arrangement gives the impression of a digital or abstract network, with the dots connected by faint, linear paths that radiate outward. There are no recognizable people, animals, or conventional objects; the primary subjects are these luminous points and their geometric organization, which together create a visually complex and abstract scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an abstract, digital environment filled with countless small, glowing blue dots arranged in three-dimensional space, creating the impression of depth and movement. These dots are connected by faint lines, forming geometric patterns that radiate outward from a central point, resembling a tunnel or a starburst effect. The background is dark, which enhances the brightness and clarity of the blue elements. The overall scene is dynamic, with the dots and lines shifting and converging, giving a sense of continuous motion through a virtual or futuristic space. There are no discernible natural or architectural features, and the setting is entirely digital, with a focus on the interplay of light, color, and geometric forms.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
