    "pre_caption": "The video features an extreme wide shot of a vast icy landscape, captured from an aerial perspective. The scene is composed of large, irregularly shaped icebergs positioned primarily in the center and top of the frame, with dark water surrounding them. The icebergs occupy the foreground and middle ground, while the water extends into the background. The camera maintains a high angle, looking down at the scene, emphasizing the scale and isolation of the environment. The shot remains steady, with no noticeable changes in framing or camera position, allowing the viewer to take in the expansive and serene icy setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is an aerial landscape scenery shot focusing on a vast expanse of icebergs floating in dark water, with creatures, likely penguins, scattered across the icebergs. The emphasis is on the environment and atmosphere, showcasing the contrast between the bright white ice and the deep, dark water, while also highlighting the beautiful blue-green hue of the sea near the icebergs. The icebergs have irregular shapes, with some featuring smooth surfaces and others having jagged edges. The water appears calm, with a rich, dark hue that accentuates the ice's stark whiteness. The video captures the scale and majesty of the natural setting, rather than focusing on a specific object, creating a sense of vastness and isolation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, filmed by a drone, captures an aerial view of a vast, icy landscape. The setting is outdoors, featuring large, white ice formations surrounded by dark, cold water. The layered folds on the ice surface reveal subtle undulations in elevation, and its surface is dotted with numerous small, dark shapes, likely animals, scattered across the expanse. The water is a deep, almost black hue, contrasting sharply with the bright ice. Patches of turquoise water are visible in areas where the ice has melted, adding a striking color contrast. The scene is likely set during daylight, as the ice and water are clearly visible. The overall atmosphere is serene and expansive, highlighting the natural beauty and isolation of the icy environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
