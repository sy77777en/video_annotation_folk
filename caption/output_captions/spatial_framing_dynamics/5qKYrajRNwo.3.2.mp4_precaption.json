    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A stop-motion puppet of a young girl with brown hair styled in two braids is depicted kneeling. She wears a dark blue pinafore dress over a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt. Her most striking features are her large, closed, pinkish, oval-shaped eyes, which lack visible pupils or irises, enhancing her unusual, doll-like appearance. She has a somewhat wide nose and a larger-than-expected, downturned mouth, further contributing to her distinctive, doll-like look. She picks up a gold-colored pocket watch from the ground in front of her.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors in a cluttered space with various indistinct items piled up in the background, including what appear to be bags and a dark green, rectangular box. The lighting creates a soft bokeh effect in the background. A gold-colored pocket watch with a chain lies on the floor in the foreground, which the girl picks up.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot centers on a girl puppet positioned in the middle ground of the frame. Initially, a gold-colored pocket watch rests on the ground in the center-bottom foreground. The background is occupied by various cluttered items, including bags to the left and a dark green box slightly left of center, all situated in the background. The girl, remaining in her central, middle ground position, reaches down and picks up the pocket watch, which moves from its initial foreground position to the middle ground as she holds it in her hands. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
