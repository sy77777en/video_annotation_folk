    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing motocross gear is on a blue and white dirt bike, which is positioned on a mound of loose brown dirt. The rider wears white and blue boots, one of which has a black Nike swoosh on the side, along with blue and white shin guards displaying the number \"60\" and a Nike logo on top. They also have on black pants and blue and white gloves. The motorcycle features a white front fork with a red \"FIRELLI\" sticker and knobby tires caked with brown mud. The rider's left foot is planted on the dirt mound.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene captures a dynamic outdoor setting on a dirt track, where a motocross rider navigates through reddish-brown terrain. The environment is characterized by loose, textured soil being kicked up by the bike's knobby tires, indicating motion and speed. The rider is equipped with protective gear, including blue and white boots, which contrast with the earthy tones of the track. The sunlight casts clear shadows, suggesting a bright, clear day. The focus is on the interaction between the bike and the terrain, highlighting the rugged surface and the rider's maneuvering skills.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, the lower portion of a motocross bike and rider are framed from a low, level angle. The rider's booted foot is planted in the bottom right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a mound of brown dirt. To the upper left and center, the bike's front wheel and fork are also in the middle ground, with the tire partially buried in the dirt. A large, out-of-focus mound of dirt occupies the bottom left foreground, partially obscuring the view of the bike. The background in the top right is indistinct. The camera maintains a static frame throughout the shot.",
