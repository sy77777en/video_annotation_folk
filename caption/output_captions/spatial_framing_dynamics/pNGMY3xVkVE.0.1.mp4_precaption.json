    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of several young adults, seen from behind, walks down a long, narrow tunnel in two rows on the left and right sides. Leading the line on the left side is a man with short dark hair, wearing a black short-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and white sneakers. Behind him is a man in a dark hoodie over a t-shirt and dark pants. On the right side, a woman in a dark top and pants is followed by a man wearing a light-colored t-shirt and dark pants. A woman with short, light-colored hair, wearing a dark checkered crop top and dark pants with a grommeted belt, is also visible on the left side of the group. All individuals are walking away from the camera toward a bright light at the end of the tunnel, with more people gradually appearing as the video progresses.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A group of people walks down a long, cylindrical corridor with corrugated metal walls and a paneled floor. The tunnel is initially cast in a dark red light from small fixtures on the ceiling. At the far end, a bright white light shines from behind a partially open roll-up door. As the figures walk toward the opening, the white light intensifies, eventually filling the entire corridor and bleaching the scene to white, silhouetting the people before obscuring them completely.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a group of people walks away from the camera down the center of a long, cylindrical tunnel, occupying the middle ground. The tunnel's corrugated walls frame the scene on the left and right, converging toward a partially open door in the center background, from which a bright light emanates. As the group moves from the middle ground deeper into the background, more people appear in the foreground on the left and right, expanding the group's formation. Simultaneously, the white light from the center background intensifies, eventually expanding to fill the entire frame. This growing light first silhouettes the figures and then bleaches the entire scene to white, completely obscuring them. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
