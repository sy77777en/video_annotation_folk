    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with brown skin and a beard is shown from a low, close-up, fisheye perspective. He wears a blue, knitted balaclava that covers the top of his head, a white t-shirt, and blue jeans. While squatting and looking directly into the camera, he forms a triangle shape with his hands, using his index fingers and thumbs to frame and stretch his mouth into a wide, exaggerated smile.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This low-angle shot, captured with a fisheye lens, presents a distorted, circular view of an indoor staircase. The walls are lined with vertical, warm-toned wood paneling. On the left, a colorful piece of framed art with bright purple and green hues is visible. A dark wooden handrail curves along the right side of the frame. The scene is lit by a single, warm overhead light. A person wearing a blue knitted balaclava, a white shirt, and jeans crouches in the center of the composition.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a low-angle, fisheye medium close-up, a man is positioned in the center foreground, squatting down. His hands are held even closer to the camera, forming a triangle shape that frames his mouth. The background consists of an indoor staircase, with a wood-paneled wall and a colorful painting in the left middle ground and a dark handrail curving along the right background. An overhead light is visible in the top center background. The camera is positioned below the subject's eye level and remains static.",
