    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A cartoon cat is shown dressed in a red devil costume. The cat's body is entirely red, with a lighter pinkish-white patch on its chest and belly. It has two small red horns on its head, a red cape with a high collar, and a pointed red tail. The cat wears a small gold ring-shaped ornament on a red collar around its neck and holds a red trident in one of its white hands. Its eyes are yellow, and it has a white muzzle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors at night in a city. The background is intentionally blurred, featuring indistinct, dark structures seemingly part of two tall buildings and numerous circular, white bokeh lights. A cartoon cat in a red devil costume, holding a matching red trident, is positioned in the foreground against this urban backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium shot centers on a cartoon cat in a devil costume, which is positioned in the foreground. The camera is at the subject's level. In the background, blurred city structures and out-of-focus bokeh lights fill the frame. The cat, holding a red trident in its left hand, initially has its right hand on its chest. It briefly tilts its head back before turning its upper body and head toward the right side of the frame, simultaneously extending its right arm and opening its hand in a welcoming gesture toward the right.",
