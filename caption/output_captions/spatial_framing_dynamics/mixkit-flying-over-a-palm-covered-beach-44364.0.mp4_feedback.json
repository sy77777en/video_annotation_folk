    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot focusing on an expansive natural landscape. The video opens with an extreme wide shot from a high aerial perspective, where a dense forest of green palm trees fills the bottom and middle ground of the frame. In the background, rolling green hills are positioned across the top of the frame beneath a clear sky. The camera then slowly pans from right to left, gradually revealing a sandy beach and the ocean, which enter the frame from the left and occupy the middle ground. By the end of the movement, the coastline takes up the left portion of the frame, while the vast forest remains in the center and right, and the distant mountains consistently form the horizon in the background. A few small buildings are partially visible in the bottom left foreground, nestled among the trees.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the expansive natural environment, highlighting the vastness of the forest, coastline, and mountains. The emphasis is on the atmosphere and scale, rather than any specific object, creating a sense of tranquility and grandeur.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, filmed by a drone, captures an expansive outdoor setting during the day. It showcases a lush tropical landscape with dense clusters of tall, green palm trees stretching across the scene. In the background, rolling hills and distant mountains create a natural horizon. The coastline is visible, with gentle waves lapping against a sandy beach. The sky is clear, allowing sunlight to illuminate the vibrant greenery and the shimmering surface of the water. The overall atmosphere is serene and natural, highlighting the beauty of the tropical environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
