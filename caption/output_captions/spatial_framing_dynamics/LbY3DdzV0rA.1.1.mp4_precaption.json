    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases a dramatic landscape dominated by a massive weather system. A colossal, brilliantly white cumulonimbus cloud fills the center and upper portion of the frame against a vivid blue sky. The underside of this cloud formation is a flat grey, with distinct shafts of heavy rain creating a curtain of precipitation over the distant terrain. Below, a wide, flat expanse of green and brown scrubland stretches towards a faint line of mountains on the horizon. The video emphasizes the immense scale and atmospheric power of the storm, highlighting the grandeur of the natural environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a daytime, outdoor scene, a vast, white cumulonimbus cloud dominates a deep blue sky. The top of the cloud is bright and puffy, while its flat base is a darker shade of grey. From the base of the cloud, a localized downpour of rain is visibly falling in grey sheets. The landscape below is a flat plain covered in green and brown scrubland, with the faint silhouette of distant mountains on the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a vast landscape. A large cumulonimbus cloud occupies the top and center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground against a blue sky in the background. From the cloud's base in the center of the frame, visible shafts of rain fall into the middle ground. The bottom portion of the frame is filled with a flat expanse of scrubland stretching from the foreground to the middle ground. In the far background, a thin line of mountains rests on the horizon. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the sky. While the camera remains static, the cloud formation drifts slowly from left to right across the frame.",
