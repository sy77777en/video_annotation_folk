    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a man in the center middle ground, seated behind a wooden table that occupies the foreground. Initially, a collapsed pile of Jenga blocks lies in the bottom right foreground, with two large keyboard keys on the bottom left. The man's hand hovers over the keys as the scattered blocks on the right move in reverse, rising to form a complete tower in the center foreground. Once the tower is built, the man moves his hand from the bottom left to the center, pulls a block from the lower part of the tower, and moves it to the top. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with dark hair, a short beard, and black-rimmed glasses sits at a wooden table, wearing a grey t-shirt with a muted floral pattern. In front of him, a collapsed pile of wooden Jenga blocks is shown reassembling itself into a tall, complete tower. To the left of the tower sit two large, white keyboard keys, one labeled \"Ctrl\" and the other \"Z.\" The man hovers his hand over these keys as the tower rebuilds, and once it is standing, he reaches out to pull a block from the bottom of the structure, releases it, and it falls to the top.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a solid black background, a Jenga tower made of light-colored wooden blocks is shown reassembling itself from a collapsed pile into a fully constructed tower on a dark brown wooden table. To the left of the tower sit two white keyboard keys, one with \"Ctrl\" and the other with \"Z\" printed on them. A man wearing glasses and a patterned t-shirt is seated at the table, and once the tower is complete, he reaches out to pull a block from the bottom of the structure, releases it, and it falls to the top.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
