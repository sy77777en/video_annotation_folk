    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot of a black car, which occupies the left foreground of the frame, focusing on its front wheel in the bottom left and its illuminated headlight in the top left. The camera then pulls back, transitioning to a full shot that reveals the entire front of the vehicle. In the final composition, the car is positioned in the left and center of the frame, moving forward in the foreground as it drives through a tunnel, which forms the background. The camera remains at the car's level, tracking alongside it throughout the entire sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A glossy black BMW sedan is featured with its bright white LED headlights and an orange turn signal illuminated. The car is customized with black wheels that have a red center cap, a front lip spoiler, and a license plate that reads \"REIN\". A white sticker text reading \"THE-LOWDOWN.COM\" is visible on the lower part of the windshield, accompanied by a red hollow square logo sticker to the left of the white text.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A glossy black car with its bright white headlights and an amber turn signal illuminated drives through a dimly lit tunnel. The tunnel has light-colored concrete walls and a dark road surface. The car features black wheels with red center caps, a front license plate that reads \"REIN,\" and a sticker on the windshield with the text \"THE-LOWDOWN.COM.\" The background is blurred, indicating the car's forward motion.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
