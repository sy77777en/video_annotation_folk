    "pre_caption": "In a static close-up shot, a person's face is framed in profile on the left side of the screen, occupying the foreground. A transparent nebulizer mask covers their nose and mouth, also positioned in the foreground on the left. Extending from the mask towards the right side of the frame is a cylindrical nebulizer chamber, which occupies the center and right foreground. The background is completely dark and out of focus. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. A small wisp of vapor briefly emanates from the mask's apparatus in the center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit setting with greenish-yellow lighting, a person is shown in a close-up profile view. Their skin appears moist. They are wearing a transparent plastic nebulizer mask that covers their nose and mouth, secured by a thin strap along the cheeks. Attached to the front of the mask is a translucent, cylindrical nebulizer chamber.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, indoor setting, a close-up shot focuses on a person's face partially covered by a clear, translucent plastic medical mask. The scene is dimly lit with a greenish-yellow light, casting reflections on the mask and the person's skin, while the background remains in shadow. The mask, which covers the nose and mouth, is secured by a dark strap and connects to a multi-part plastic apparatus. A small amount of condensation is visible inside the mask, and a brief wisp of vapor emanates from it.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
