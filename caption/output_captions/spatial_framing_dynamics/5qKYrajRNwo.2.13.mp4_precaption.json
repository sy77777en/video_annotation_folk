    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pair of light-skinned hands holds a small, red fabric pouch tied with a yellow string over an open drawer. The hands untie the string and unfold the pouch, revealing a round, gold-colored pocket watch with a white face, gold hands, and the brand name \"BIJIN\" visible. The watch is then lifted from the pouch. The drawer below contains a collection of personal items, including a wooden-framed photograph of two men with exaggerated, caricature-like features, several folded pieces of cloth, a dark green wallet, and a round, yellow-lidded container. The edge frames of the drawers are painted with a mix of colors, including blue, white, and yellow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective looks down into an open, rustic wooden drawer. The drawer frame has mottled blue and white on the edges, resembling paint. Inside, it contains various items, including several folded cloths in shades of green, gray, and gold, a dark green wallet, and a round yellow lid. A small, wood-framed photograph of three figures is located slightly above the middle of the drawer, against the back. A pair of hands holds a small, red, velvety pouch, unties its yellow string, and reveals a gold-colored pocket watch with a white face.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In an overhead close-up shot, a pair of hands occupies the center foreground, holding a red pouch over an open drawer that fills the frame. In the middle ground below, the drawer's contents are arranged with a framed photograph in the top center, folded cloths to the right and left, a wallet in the bottom left, and a lidded container in the top left. The hands remain in the center foreground as they open the pouch, revealing a gold pocket watch. The watch is then lifted slightly upward by the hands, remaining in the foreground, directly above the stationary contents of the drawer.",
