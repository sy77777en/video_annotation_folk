    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large, muscular humanoid figure with green skin and short, dark hair. The figure is shirtless, showcasing a highly defined muscular build. The expression is intense, with a wide-open mouth and furrowed brow, suggesting a state of anger or aggression. The figure's posture is upright and imposing, emphasizing its size and strength.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting with a large, muscular green figure in front of a historic building featuring arched structural elements and a glass roof. The environment is characterized by overcast skies with clouds, suggesting a gloomy atmosphere. The building's stone facade and metal framework add a sense of age and grandeur. The scene transitions from a wider view of the figure standing in front of the building to a close-up of its face, capturing its intense expression. The overall color palette is muted, with earthy tones dominating the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of the large, muscular green figure, capturing it from the waist up. This initial framing places the figure in the center of the frame, with the historic building and its arched structure in the background. The building occupies the upper portion of the frame, while the figure stands prominently in the foreground. As the scene progresses, the shot transitions to a close-up, focusing on the figure's face. In this close-up, the figure fills most of the frame, with its intense expression taking center stage. The background becomes less distinct, though the cloudy sky remains visible behind the figure. Throughout the sequence, the camera maintains a level height relative to the subject, keeping the figure's imposing presence consistent. The transition from medium shot to close-up emphasizes the figure's facial features and expression, shifting the viewer's attention from the broader setting to the subject's intensity.",
