    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a small, stylized figure resembling a person on a bicycle, depicted in black and white with minimal detail. Four colorful points follow the figure. The bicycle itself is minimalistic, with thin lines forming the frame and wheels.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, a small, complex black-and-white line-art figure moves against a solid gray, featureless background. The figure, which appears to be on a wheeled contraption, is accented with tiny red, green, and blue dots. Throughout the scene, a large, irregular polygon, rendered as a simple black outline, intermittently appears from the lower right corner, moves swiftly upward, and then disappears.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, a small, stylized figure on a bicycle is initially positioned in the lower right of the frame in the middle ground, while a large, black-outlined polygon is visible in the upper left foreground. The polygon immediately moves up and out of the frame. The small figure remains in the lower right quadrant, moving in tight, circular patterns for the duration of the video. The large polygon repeatedly enters the scene from the bottom right, moves diagonally up and to the left across the background, and exits at the top left. The camera remains static and is positioned at a level height, capturing the scene from a side-view perspective.",
