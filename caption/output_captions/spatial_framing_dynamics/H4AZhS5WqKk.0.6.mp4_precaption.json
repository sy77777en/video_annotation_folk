    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two cartoon-style animated cats in a confrontational scene. On the left, the head of a large, gray-blue cat is shown in a close-up. This cat has a white muzzle, long black whiskers, a black nose, and large yellow eyes; its expression changes from surprised to angry. Facing it on the right is a smaller, full-bodied red cat styled as a devil. This red cat has a lighter red belly, muzzle, and hands, small horns, a pointed tail, and a small black cape. It stands on a white, cloud-like object while holding a red trident and gesturing toward the larger cat with a shifting expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit, ambiguous space, a large, blue-gray cat with yellow eyes is seen in a close-up. The background is dark and out of focus, showing indistinct vertical structures, while slender white raindrops fall downward through the scene. Positioned in the foreground, a smaller, red cat wearing a devil costume with a cape and horns stands on a white, cloud-like shape. The red figure holds a matching red trident.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features two cartoon-style animated cats. The gray-blue character on the left is shown in a close-up of its head, while the red character on the right is shown in full body.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up of a large, gray-blue cat's head, which occupies the left foreground of the frame. Positioned in the right middle ground, a smaller, full-bodied red cat stands on a white, cloud-like object. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, creating a direct line of sight between them. While the large cat's head remains static, the smaller red cat on the right gestures with its left hand, extending it toward the larger cat, and slightly shifts its body and the red trident it holds. The background consists of dark, out-of-focus vertical structures, with white raindrops falling throughout the scene, occupying the space between the foreground and background elements.",
