    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot, filmed from a high angle looking down. In the middle ground, four blue, glowing human figures are visible. One figure stands on the left side of the frame. To its right, a group of three other figures lies in the middle ground, arranged in a row stretching from the center-left towards the right side of the frame. These figures are positioned on a dark, reflective surface that occupies the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. A textured, glowing yellow dot matrix wall is positioned in the background, spanning the top edge of the frame. An overlay text \"[77]\" is located in the bottom left corner of the frame, in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features four human figures rendered in a glowing, textured blue material, resembling a digital or holographic effect. All figures are dressed in military-style uniforms with caps and have their hands placed behind their backs. The figures on the far left and far right are lying on their right sides. In the center, the figure on the middle left is lying face down, while the figure on the middle right is lying face up. The upper part of the frame displays a holographic wall composed of a yellow dot matrix pattern.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor scene in a dimly lit environment. Four human figures, rendered in a blue, translucent, wireframe-like style, are the main focus. One figure stands on the left side. In the center and extending to the right, three other figures are lying down on a dark, reflective surface, with their hands placed behind their backs and their legs bent. Above these figures, a textured surface with a pattern of dots glows with orange and yellow light. The video includes an overlay text \"[77]\" located in the bottom left corner.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
