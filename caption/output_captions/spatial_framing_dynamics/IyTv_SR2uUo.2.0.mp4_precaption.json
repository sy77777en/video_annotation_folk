    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The top of a dark gray hammerhead shark's head is visible in the foreground, showcasing its distinctive wide, flat, T-shaped structure. In the mid-ground, two gray sharks with classic, streamlined body shapes swim. Multiple small, light-colored fish are visible in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to a hammerhead shark, the perspective is of a clear, turquoise underwater scene during the day. The camera glides forward over a bright, sandy ocean floor, which is illuminated by sunlight filtering through the water's surface. The distinctive, dark, T-shaped head of the hammerhead is visible at the bottom of the view. In the upper right, two additional sharks swim through the water, and several small, silvery fish can be seen in the background.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera captures the head of the whale swimming underwater, which consists of a close-up shot while also showing a wide shot of the scene underwater and other sharks.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a point-of-view shot from a camera mounted on a hammerhead shark, creating a wide shot of the underwater scene with a close-up of the shark's head. The dark, T-shaped head of the hammerhead is fixed in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame. The camera glides forward smoothly, showing the sandy ocean floor moving backward in the middle ground and background. In the background at the top right, another shark swims from right to left across the frame. A small, light-colored fish is also visible in the middle ground, swimming forward just above the hammerhead's head.",
