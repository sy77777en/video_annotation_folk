    "pre_caption": "The video, captured with a fisheye lens from a low angle at the subject's level, begins with a full shot of a skateboarder positioned in the center-right foreground, riding along a light gray concrete sidewalk that occupies the bottom foreground and extends into the middle ground. To the left, a silver hatchback is parked in the left foreground/middle ground, with a street and other cars visible in the left middle ground. Buildings, including one with white exterior stairs, are in the right middle ground, while palm trees are scattered in the middle ground and background. As the skateboarder moves forward, initially towards the center of the frame, he then veers slightly right, approaching a low, gray concrete wall in the right middle ground. He jumps onto this wall, which is positioned in front of a modern, dark gray slatted building in the right middle ground, with the camera tracking his movement and maintaining the low, distorted perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man is skateboarding. He is wearing a white tank top, black pants, white socks, and black and white sneakers. He also wears a black cap backwards and has visible tattoos on his left arm.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a level angle with a distinct fisheye lens effect causing peripheral distortion, unfolds in a sunlit urban setting. It follows movement along a light gray concrete sidewalk that runs parallel to a street where cars, including a silver hatchback, are parked. Adjacent to the sidewalk, there's a low, gray concrete wall or planter, and buildings with varied architecture: one features white exterior stairs and a light-colored facade, while another presents a modern, dark gray slatted facade with some greenery. Tall palm trees are interspersed throughout, set against a bright sky, with more buildings visible in the urban background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
