    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a cityscape scenery shot, offering a perspective down a wide Venetian canal. On either side, historic, multi-story buildings with varied facades, arched windows, and terracotta roofs press closely together, bordering the greenish-blue, slightly choppy water. The scene is animated by several watercraft: a yellow and white water taxi prominently marked \"ALILAGUNA\" traverses the middle ground, a classic black gondola with its gondolier glides further down the canal, and other smaller boats, including a blue one moored on the left, are visible. The sky is a uniform overcast grey. The focus is not on a singular subject but rather on the encompassing environment, capturing the characteristic atmosphere, architectural density, and lively maritime activity of the iconic Venetian waterway, emphasizing its scale and unique urban fabric.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy, under an overcast sky. The greenish water of the canal is slightly choppy. Lining both sides of the waterway are historic, multi-story buildings with varied facades and numerous windows. Several boats are visible on the water. A white and yellow water taxi enters from the right side of the scene, while a gondola is rowed in the middle distance. Other gondolas and smaller boats are moored along the canal's edges.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide scenery shot, looking down a wide Venetian canal that occupies the center of the frame and extends from the foreground into the background. Historic buildings line both the left and right sides of the waterway, receding into the distance. In the bottom right foreground, a water taxi moves from right to left across the scene. Further in the center middle ground, a gondola travels away from the camera. Other boats are moored along the banks, with a blue boat visible in the left middle ground. The camera is positioned at a height above the water, offering a stable, elevated perspective of the canal.",
