    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned, middle-aged man with a dark beard and mustache is shown driving a car at night. He wears a dark beanie and a dark jacket. Initially seen in profile from the passenger's side, he looks forward while gripping the steering wheel. A black assault rifle is propped up in the car next to him. The perspective then shifts to a view from inside the vehicle, looking out the front windshield. The man's hands are visible on the steering wheel as he drives along a wet, two-lane road toward a vehicle in the distance with bright headlights and flashing red and blue lights. The man remains in the driver's seat as the camera's focus moves away from him to the view ahead.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place inside a vehicle at night, looking forward through the front windshield. It is raining, and the wet, two-lane road reflects the flashing red and blue lights of emergency vehicles in the distance, along with the bright headlights of an approaching car. The interior of the vehicle is dark, revealing a portion of the dashboard, a steering wheel, and a rifle propped up on the passenger side. Windshield wipers are active, clearing the rain from the glass. Overlaid at the bottom of the screen are green text subtitles displaying dialogue, and a white text overlay that reads \"[POLICE SIRENS WAIL]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a man in profile, positioned in the foreground on the left side of the frame, with the camera at his level. The perspective then transitions to a point-of-view from the driver's seat, causing the man to disappear as the primary subject, though his hands remain visible on the steering wheel at the bottom of the frame. This new wide shot frames the car's dashboard and a rifle in the foreground. The view looks forward onto a wet road in the middle ground, leading to a vehicle with flashing lights in the center background. The camera remains at eye level from the driver's perspective throughout this final composition.",
