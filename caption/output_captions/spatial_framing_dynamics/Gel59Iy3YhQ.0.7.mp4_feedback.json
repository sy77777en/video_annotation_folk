    "pre_caption": "This wide shot frames a small, glowing humanoid creature in the center of the screen, positioned in the middle ground. At its feet, also in the center middle ground, are smaller gems, while several other small creatures are visible in the upper right, also in the middle ground. The scene is enclosed by dark, stone-block cavern walls that form the background and middle ground. In the foreground, user interface elements are overlaid on the screen: health and resource bars are in the top left, a mini-map and currency display are in the top right, control icons are in the bottom left, and an inventory bar is at the bottom center. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the framing remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, green-skinned humanoid creature with large, pointed ears stands at the center, wearing a red helmet. It holds a hammer that emits a bright, fiery orange-and-yellow glow, enveloping its upper body. To the upper right, variously colored gems are visible, including cyan and purple ones. At the feet of the glowing central character lie gems and treasures.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a dark, underground cavern. The walls are constructed from rough, rectangular stone blocks in shades of brown and purple, with a sandy dirt floor below. The scene is dimly lit, with the primary illumination coming from a bright, flickering, fiery light source emanating from a character in the center. Several smaller gems and treasures are visible in the surrounding darkness. Overlays are present on the screen: the top left corner displays health and resource bars; the top right shows currency, a settings icon, and a mini-map; the bottom left features control icons for tools and weapons; and the bottom center contains an inventory bar with various collected ores and gems.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
