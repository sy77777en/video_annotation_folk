    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an animated young boy with fair skin and short brown hair. His facial expressions transition from eye-rolling to a look of confusion, marked by continuous eye movement. Another person's hands are involved, initially using one hand to open his right eye, followed by both hands slapping his cheeks. His actions suggest he is either responding to something unseen or making exaggerated, goofy faces.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person POV, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, the scene is a close-up of a cartoon figure within an indoor setting. The background is softly blurred, featuring pale, neutral-colored walls, while green, curving, vine-like structures are on the floor. The lighting is diffuse, and the focus remains tightly on the character in the foreground throughout the shot.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot centers on an animated boy's face, which occupies the foreground for the entire duration. Initially, his face is framed by two hands in the foreground, with the right hand pulling his eye open and the left hand pushing his cheek. The hands then briefly pull back before returning to frame both sides of his face. As the shot concludes, the hands move out of the frame, and two green earpieces enter from the left and right sides, settling into his ears. Throughout the video, blurred green, vine-like structures are visible in the background, and the camera remains positioned at the boy's eye level.",
