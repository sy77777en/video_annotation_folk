    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, featuring a woman in the center middle ground of an expansive grassy field that fills the foreground and middle ground. A tall cornfield forms a horizontal line in the background, with a dark pine forest situated behind it, primarily on the right and extending to the left. Distant mountains are visible in the far background at the top left, beneath a pale sky at the top of the frame. As the woman runs towards the camera, the shot size transitions from wide to medium, then to a medium close-up, as she moves from the middle ground to the foreground while staying in the center. At her closest approach, the shot becomes a close-up where her head briefly exits the top of the frame, leaving her body from the neck down in the center foreground. As she then runs away from the camera and up a gentle slope, the shot reverts to a medium shot and then widens further, with her figure moving from the foreground back into the middle ground and shifting from the center towards the top left of the frame. The grassy field remains prominent in the foreground and middle ground, while the cornfield, forest, and mountains retain their respective background positions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with long hair that is brown at the top and gradually transitions to blonde. She is wearing a white two-piece outfit consisting of a bandeau top and loose-fitting pants, paired with white sneakers. She is seen running in a grassy field. Initially, she is visible in a wide shot. As she runs towards the camera, she becomes larger in the frame, and for a moment, only her body from the neck down is visible as her head moves out of the top of the frame. Subsequently, as she runs away from the camera, the view returns to a wider shot showing her full figure again.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot from a handheld panoramic camera, with noticeable distortion, shows a person running through a lush green grassy field. In the background, a tall, dense cornfield lines the edge of the meadow, with a dark green pine forest and distant mountains visible under a pale sky, indicating sunset or dusk. The camera moves with the person, capturing the motion through the long grass. Yellow subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen, displaying the words \"Ohh,\" \"yes,\" \"yes, yes, yes,\" and \"that's it.\" At the end of the video, part of the filmer\u2019s left hand appears, making an \"OK\" gesture.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a woman in a white dress running on an outdoor grassy field. Initially, the frame shows a wide shot. As she gets closer, she becomes larger in the frame, with her head exiting the frame, leaving only her body below the head visible. Then, as she moves away from the camera, the shot returns to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
