    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an interior scenery shot that transitions from an enclosed space to an open one. The focus is on the environment and the unsettling atmosphere it creates, rather than on a specific subject, an effect heightened by the first-person perspective. The sequence begins inside a dark, reddish-brown, enclosed water slide tube, looking toward a small circle of light. It then emerges from the slide's red-rimmed exit into a starkly lit, institutional-looking pool room. The room features white tiled walls, a pool of murky greenish water, and a simple metal railing along a set of stairs in the background, all contributing to a sense of eerie emptiness.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moves from the inside of a smooth, red, funnel-shaped structure with a matte surface and gentle curves, transitioning into a large, indoor swimming pool area. The pool is surrounded by white tiled walls and flooring, with a metal handrail leading into the water. The water\u2019s surface is calm, reflecting the bright overhead lighting, and the environment is clean and minimalistic. The space is illuminated by natural light streaming through circular windows, and an open doorway is visible in the background, contributing to the sense of depth and openness in the setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot from inside a dark, reddish-brown water slide tube, with the circular exit positioned at the center and in the background of the frame. The camera is at the same height as the slide\u2019s interior, emphasizing the enclosed space. As the camera moves forward, the shot transitions to a wide shot, emerging from the slide\u2019s exit into a large, open pool room. In this wide shot, the pool occupies the lower center and foreground, while the white tiled walls and metal railing are positioned in the middle ground and background, spanning from the left to the right side of the frame. The open doorway is visible in the background, slightly left of center, and the camera remains at a low height, close to the water\u2019s surface, maintaining a first-person perspective throughout the movement.",
