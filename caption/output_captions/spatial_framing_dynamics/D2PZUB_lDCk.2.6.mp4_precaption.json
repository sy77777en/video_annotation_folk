    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This abstract animation features a dark, deep-gold background filled with shimmering golden particles. At the bottom of the scene, a dense collection of these particles forms a wavy, fluid-like surface that glitters and shifts. From this surface, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rise upwards, each topped with a bright, star-like point of light. Smaller, floating golden specks are scattered throughout the entire space, drifting gently. A bright, horizontal glow emanates from the horizon line, creating a focal point of intense light where the wavy surface meets the dark background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a dark background, a landscape of shimmering golden particles forms gentle, rolling waves at the bottom of the scene. Thin, vertical lines of golden light continuously rise from this glittering surface, ascending towards the top. Numerous smaller, glowing specks of light float and drift throughout the space, interspersed between the rising lines. A bright, radiant glow emanates from the horizon where the wavy surface meets the dark background, creating a central point of illumination.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "This abstract scene is presented from a static, low-angle perspective. A wavy surface composed of golden particles occupies the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. A bright, horizontal glow emanates from the bottom-center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. From this central area, numerous thin, vertical lines of light rise upwards towards the top of the frame. Smaller, floating particles are scattered throughout the entire space, occupying the foreground, middle ground, and background, creating a sense of depth as they drift gently.",
