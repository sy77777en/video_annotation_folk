    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features an extreme close-up of the intricate internal mechanism of an old, complex machine. The components, which include interlocking gears of various sizes and supporting levers, are made of a dark metal with a slightly rough, non-reflective texture. The entire assembly is seen in very low light, with a cool blue light source casting subtle highlights on the edges and teeth of the static gears, emphasizing their shape and complexity against the deep shadows of the machine's interior.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A close-up, objective shot delves into the dark interior of a complex mechanical apparatus. Under dim, cool-blue lighting, the camera slowly moves through layers of static, interlocking metallic gears and cogs. The components, rendered in dark gray and silver, are tightly arranged within a shadowed framework. The limited light catches the textured surfaces and toothed edges of the wheels, revealing the intricate and dense construction of the machinery.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The lens passes through the middle of the mechanical components, revealing an extreme close-up shot with the focal length maintained at a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Due to the blurred background, the relative position of the camera cannot be confirmed.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an extreme close-up from within a dark mechanical interior, showing a blue-lit surface in the top right. The camera then pulls back and moves slightly left, passing through the middle of the mechanical components to reveal layers of interlocking gears and levers. A large gear system occupies the foreground at the bottom and center of the frame, while another set of gears is visible in the middle ground just above it. The lens maintains an extreme close-up perspective with a focal length similar to a medium shot, keeping the machinery's details in focus. Due to the blurred background, the relative position of the camera cannot be confirmed.",
