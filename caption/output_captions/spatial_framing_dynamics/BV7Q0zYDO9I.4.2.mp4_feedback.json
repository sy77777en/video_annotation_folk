A convoy of white trucks moves in a single file line from a large hangar in the top-left middle ground towards a four-way intersection in the center of the frame. To the right of the convoy's path, in the top-center middle ground, are two industrial buildings. A small guard tower is positioned in the middle ground at the bottom-right corner of the central intersection.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An aerial view shows a convoy of identical white trucks with black front and rear sections emerging from a large, arched-roof hangar. The trucks proceed in two lines along a two-lane road toward a four-way intersection marked with white crosswalks. The scene is set in an industrial area with several grey, utilitarian buildings, including a rectangular structure with a weathered, flat roof and another rectangular structure with a brown roof and vents. A small, fortified guard tower stands near one corner of the intersection. The asphalt roads are lined with yellow and white markings and flanked by sidewalks with streetlights.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of an industrial-style complex. The scene features several large, simple buildings with weathered roofs set against gray, textured ground. A network of dark asphalt roads, marked with yellow and white lines, forms a central-bottom four-way intersection. A long convoy of white trucks with black cabs proceeds in two parallel lines, emerging from a large, hangar-like building and moving toward the intersection. Low concrete barriers and streetlights line the roads, and a small, tower-like structure stands near one corner. An overlay with white text appears at the bottom-left of the screen, reading, '[39]'.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
