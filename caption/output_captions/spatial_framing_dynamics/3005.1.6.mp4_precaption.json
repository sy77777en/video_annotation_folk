    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a bustling basketball court filled with numerous people. As the main subject, a man in a dark athletic outfit, catches the basketball, many of the other individuals disappear in a time-lapse effect. As he prepares to drive towards the basket, more people vanish, ultimately leaving him alone on the court. The setting is slightly dim, creating a more intimate and focused atmosphere for his practice session.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor basketball court with wooden flooring and black painted key areas, surrounded by mostly empty tiered seating in red and green sections. Basketball hoops with nets are positioned at each end of the court. Initially, several people are scattered around, some standing and others walking. As the time-lapse effect progresses, the people gradually disappear, leaving only one person playing basketball at the end. The lighting is bright and even, and overlay text in Chinese appears at the bottom of the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a basketball court, capturing the entire space from a high vantage point above the subjects. The main subject, a man in a dark athletic outfit, is initially positioned near the center of the frame in the middle ground, preparing to catch a basketball. As he catches the ball, he moves slightly forward toward the bottom center of the frame, still in the middle ground. Other individuals are scattered across the court and seating areas, primarily in the background and foreground, but they gradually disappear through a time-lapse effect. The basketball hoops are located at the top left and top right corners of the frame, in the background. The tiered seating surrounds the court, with red seats on the left side and green seats on the right, all in the background. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining a consistent overhead perspective that emphasizes the spaciousness of the court and the diminishing presence of other individuals. The lighting is bright and even, and Chinese text appears at the bottom of the frame. The main subject's movement is subtle, primarily involving a slight shift in position as he prepares to drive towards the basket.",
