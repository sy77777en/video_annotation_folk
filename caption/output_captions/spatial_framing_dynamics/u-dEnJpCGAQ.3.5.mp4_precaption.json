    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A male lion with a tan body and a prominent dark brown mane walks from left to right across a green grassy field. The lion has a muscular build and a long tail with a dark tuft at the end.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a vast, sunlit grassy plain, likely a savanna, stretching towards a hazy horizon with rolling hills. The ground is covered in short, green grass, dotted with small, scattered white and brown patches. In the mid-ground and background, clusters of low, green trees and bushes are sparsely distributed. A male lion with a dark mane walks steadily from right to left across the open grassland. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, observing the lion in its natural habitat.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, featuring a male lion in the center of the frame, walking from left to right across the middle ground of a vast grassy field that extends from the foreground to the background. Clusters of low trees and bushes are visible in the middle ground and background, scattered across the frame, with rolling hills in the distant background along the top edge. As the lion continues its left-to-right movement, remaining in the center of the frame and the middle ground, the shot transitions to a full shot. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
