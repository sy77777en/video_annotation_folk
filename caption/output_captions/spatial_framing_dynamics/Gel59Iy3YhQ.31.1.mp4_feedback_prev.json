    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a humanoid figure seated in the center middle ground. To the left, a floor lamp stands in the foreground, while a small table is positioned in the right middle ground. In the background, large arched windows span the width of the scene. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, slowly zooms in, transitioning the scene into a medium shot that frames the figure from the waist up. The figure remains in the center middle ground, while a text overlay appears at the bottom center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A humanoid figure is seated in an office chair, later identified by the text \"THE LORD OF DOORS.\" The figure's most striking feature is its head, a tall, white, cylindrical column with a glowing green keyhole in the center instead of a face. It is clad in white and purple armor with large, pointed shoulder pads and a segmented, white covering over its legs. Initially, the figure rests a grey mug on a small saucer in its hands. As the figure lifts the mug, the words \"WORLD'S BEST LORD\" become visible on the mug, and the text \"THE LORD OF DOORS\" appears as an overlay.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dark, sparsely furnished room characterized by large, arched windows. Hazy light in shades of teal, yellow, and red filters through the windows, revealing blurry exterior views. The room contains a modern office chair, a small side table, and a floor lamp that casts a spotlight on the central area. As the scene progresses, text reading \"WORLD'S BEST LORD\" becomes visible on a mug held by a figure. An overlay of white, serif text appears at the bottom, displaying the title \"THE LORD OF DOORS.\"**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
