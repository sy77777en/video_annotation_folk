    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the foreground, a medium-skinned, middle-aged man with graying dark hair, a mustache, and glasses leans forward with a shocked expression, his mouth agape. He wears a yellow jumpsuit with a blue patch on the right shoulder with a white background. To the left and slightly behind him, another man with short, dark hair and glasses, wearing an identical yellow jumpsuit, stands with his back partially to the viewer, his left arm raised. In the background, between these two, a younger, light-skinned man with short dark hair is depicted in a white chef's coat and a striped apron, looking toward the man in the foreground with a concerned expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit, high-tech control room rendered in an illustrative, comic-book style. In the foreground, a dark computer console emits a bright cyan glow from its base. The background features brown walls and a dark ceiling, with various control panels displaying illuminated red and green lights. A white doorway is visible on the left side of the room.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a man is positioned in the foreground, slightly to the right of center, leaning forward with his hands on a console that occupies the bottom of the frame. To the left and in the middle ground, another man stands with his back partially turned, his left arm raised. Positioned in the center background between these two figures, a third man in a chef's uniform is depicted mid-stride. A white doorway is visible in the left background, while various control panels are situated in the right background.",
