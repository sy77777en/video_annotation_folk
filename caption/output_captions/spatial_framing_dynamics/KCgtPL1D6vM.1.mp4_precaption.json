    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a cityscape scenery shot of a bustling, narrow street in a historic European city. The view looks up a sloping road, defined by tram tracks and flanked on both sides by tall, traditional buildings with storefronts on the ground floor and balconies above. A vintage red tram is visible in the middle distance, while a white and yellow tram, decorated with small monkey illustrations, the brand \"MONKEY 47,\" and the \"carris\" brand with a logo in a yellow rectangle, moves across the foreground. Pedestrians can be seen on the sidewalks, and a person on a scooter drives up the street. There is no single main subject, as the camera's wide, static perspective is focused on capturing the overall environment and atmosphere of the location. The various elements\u2014the iconic trams, the distinct architecture, and the flow of people\u2014work together to create a comprehensive portrait of daily life on this specific street.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a daytime, outdoor scene in Lisbon, Portugal, a narrow street with tram tracks is flanked by multi-story buildings with yellow and stone facades and iron-railed balconies. A street sign on a corner building reads \"RUA DA MADALENA\". In the distance, a red tram is visible, while a white and yellow tram with \"carris\" and \"MONKEY 47\" branding moves across the foreground. Pedestrians are on the sidewalks, and a scooter is on the street under an overcast sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide, static scenery shot captures a street view from a street-level perspective, looking up an incline. The street and its tram tracks begin at the bottom of the frame and recede toward the center background, flanked by buildings on the left and right. In the middle ground, a red tram is positioned in the center, with pedestrians on the sidewalks and a scooter moving away from the camera. The primary movement occurs in the foreground, where a white and yellow tram enters from the right, travels horizontally across the frame, and exits on the left, temporarily obscuring the middle-ground view.",
