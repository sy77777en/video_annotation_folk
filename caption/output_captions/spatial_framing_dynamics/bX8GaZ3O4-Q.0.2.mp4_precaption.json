    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, slender tree frog with bright, light-green skin is shown climbing a fluted, silver-colored metal rod. The frog has a distinct reddish-brown stripe running from its large, coppery eye down the side of its body. Its limbs are also green, and its visible toe pads are a light reddish-pink color. The frog moves up the rod, its body pressed against the surface, before pausing. The rod it is climbing has a white plastic fitting attached to its top end.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunlit outdoor setting, a small green frog climbs a fluted, metallic-looking pole. The pole, which has a white, ringed fitting at its top, is positioned against a soft-focus background of lush green foliage. The bright light creates a slight haze and reflects off the pole's surface as the frog makes its way upward.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a frog climbing a metal rod. It starts with a close-up of the rod, then the frog enters from the bottom left, climbs up, and stops at the center of the frame, shown in a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a close-up on a fluted metal rod, which is angled diagonally from the bottom left to the top right of the frame. A green frog enters from the bottom left foreground and climbs up the rod, moving toward the center. As it moves, the framing adjusts to a full shot of the frog, which then pauses in the middle ground, positioned centrally on the rod. A white plastic fitting is visible at the top right, attached to the end of the rod, while the background is composed of out-of-focus green foliage. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
