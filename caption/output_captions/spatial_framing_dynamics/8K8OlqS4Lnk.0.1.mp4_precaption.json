    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a suburban scenery shot, capturing a magnificent double rainbow arching across a gray, overcast sky. The primary rainbow is bright and distinct, while a second, fainter arc is visible above it. The scene is framed by elements of a residential neighborhood, including lush green trees, a prominent palm tree on the right, a concrete fence, and power lines stretching across the view. The focus is not on a specific subject but on the overall atmosphere and the natural beauty of the rainbow, with the street-level environment serving as a familiar foreground to the celestial display.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A vibrant double rainbow arches across a grey, overcast sky in a tropical suburban setting. The view, which tilts slowly upward, is framed by lush green trees, including a prominent palm tree on the right. Below, a concrete fence with vertical posts runs alongside a paved road. Several black power lines crisscross the scene, and the faint silhouette of clouds is visible in the distant background.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot. Initially, a bright primary rainbow and a fainter secondary rainbow arc from the bottom left to the top right across the middle ground and background. A prominent palm tree stands in the right middle ground, with other green trees spanning the middle ground. In the foreground, a concrete fence is visible at the bottom right, and power lines cross horizontally through the middle of the frame. The camera then slowly tilts upward, shifting the composition. By the end of the shot, the view is focused on the upper portion of the double rainbow against the grey sky, with the treetops and a utility pole now occupying the bottom of the frame. The camera is positioned at street level, looking up.",
