    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot showing Tom, the animated cat, leaping off the bed on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, with the bed and nightstands occupying the center and right middle ground, and a white table with a vase and a striped chair in the bottom left foreground. The patterned carpet covers the foreground, and the headboard and lamps are in the background. As Tom tiptoes forward in a crouched posture, he moves from the left middle ground toward the center, passing the table and approaching the window. The camera then transitions to a medium shot, centering Tom in the frame and bringing him into the foreground as he stands in front of the window. The window, with a circular cut-out, is now prominent in the background, while the table and vase are visible in the left background. Tom props himself up, bounces onto a stool (not fully visible), and flings the white bundle through the window, then pinches the glass to seal it. Throughout, the camera remains at Tom\u2019s height, maintaining a straight-on perspective as Tom\u2019s position shifts from the left middle ground to the center foreground, with the spatial focus moving from the wider room to a tighter view of Tom and the window.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an animated anthropomorphic cat named Tom, who has blue fur, a white face, chest, and paws, large yellow eyes, a small black nose, and prominent pink inner ears. In the scene, Tom leaps off the bed and tiptoes forward in a crouched, sneaky posture while holding a white bundle in his left hand. Upon reaching the table, he props himself up with his right hand and bounces onto the stool. With an exaggerated flourish, he flings the bundle out the window, then quickly pinches his fingertips together to seal the round gap in the glass. Tom's movements are highly animated, emphasizing his cartoonish and lively appearance. No other subjects are present in the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a well-lit, modern bedroom featuring a large bed with a textured dark green blanket, white pillows, and a beige upholstered headboard. On either side of the bed, there are nightstands, each with a white table lamp. The left nightstand holds a small wine barrel with a bottle of wine inside and two goblets beside it. In the foreground on the left side of the frame, there is a white table with a porcelain-like surface, featuring a delicate green vase filled with white flowers. Next to the table is a black-and-white striped chair, with only the backrest visible. The floor is covered with a patterned beige carpet. As the camera pulls back, a window is revealed with a circular section cut out of its glass, bordered by deep brown wooden frames. The environment is tidy and organized, with soft, neutral tones dominating the decor. An animated blue and gray cat with white markings and pink ears, named Tom, moves through the scene. Tom flings a white bundle through the round hole in the window and then cleverly replaces the circular glass piece, sealing the pane seamlessly. The video combines live-action elements with animation.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
