    "pre_caption": "This hand-drawn animation is presented in a medium shot, consistently showing a woman from the waist up. She is positioned in the center of the frame against a plain white background. Throughout the animation, as her attire and appearance transform, her body remains centrally located. The primary movement within the frame occurs when she fans out a piece of her clothing, which expands from her central position toward the left side of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A hand-drawn animation in blue pencil depicts the upper body of a woman undergoing a transformation in appearance and attire. Initially, she is shown with her hair tied back, bangs parted to both sides of her forehead, and adorned with a small butterfly-shaped hairpin. She is dressed in a traditional Chinese outfit with a high collar and short sleeves, resembling a qipao. The scene then shifts as her hair becomes medium-length and flows freely over her shoulders before being tied back again. Her facial features and makeup transition from an East Asian style to an Indian style, and she wears large hoop earrings. Her inner garment changes to a short-sleeved, midriff-baring top, with a long piece of fabric draped over one shoulder and wrapped around her waist, resembling a sari. She adjusts the sari, lifting the back part forward and upward with her left hand to fan it out.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A series of blue pencil-sketch animations are presented against a beige background, resembling yellowed sketch paper, with a pure white border. The sequence features the same woman whose style transitions smoothly from a Chinese-style dress to an Indian sari, creating a seamless transformation. The animations include scenes of her adjusting her garment and twirling the fabric.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a hand-drawn stop-motion animation that depicts the upper body of a woman and the process of her clothing changes.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Due to the 2D hand-drawn animation, it is difficult to describe the camera height.",
