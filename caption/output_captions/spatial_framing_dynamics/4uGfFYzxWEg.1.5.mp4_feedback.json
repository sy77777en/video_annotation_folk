    "pre_caption": "The camera captures a static medium shot from behind three out-of-focus, mannequin-like figures who occupy the foreground. A dark gray figure stands on the left, while two white figures are positioned on the right. They face a bank of eight television monitors arranged in two rows of four, which are in sharp focus and fill the middle ground and background of the frame. The monitors display various wide shots and close-ups from a game show. A desk is visible in the middle ground, situated between the figures and the wall of screens. The camera is positioned at the level of the figures, maintaining a consistent perspective throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In what appears to be a monitoring room, three smooth, featureless, mannequin-like figures are shown from behind in the foreground, out of focus. The figure on the left is dark gray, while the two on the right are white. They stand facing a wall of television monitors, which are in sharp focus. The screens display various scenes from the game show \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\". A light-skinned male contestant with short brown hair, wearing a light-colored polo shirt with a dark collar, is visible on multiple screens, appearing pensive. An older, light-skinned man with graying hair in a dark suit is also shown. The monitors display the game show's characteristic blue interface with questions, multiple-choice answers, and prize money indicators.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, indoor room, a bank of television monitors is arranged in two rows. The screens display various scenes from the game show \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\", showing different contestants, questions, and prize money amounts. In the foreground, the silhouettes of several featureless, mannequin-like figures stand with their backs to the camera, observing the monitors. The only significant light in the room emanates from the television screens. A text overlay in the bottom-left corner identifies the source as \"ITV - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (2001)\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is positioned in front of a matrix of monitors, capturing a medium shot of three figures facing the screens in a room resembling a monitoring room. The figures in front of the screens are out of focus, while the monitors in a wide shot remain in focus.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
