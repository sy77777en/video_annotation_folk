    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman and a man stand facing each other. The woman, on the left, has dark hair styled in an updo and held back by a purple headband. She has fair skin and wears a purple dress with a white high collar and silver buttons. The man on the right is bald on top with dark hair on the sides and a short, dark beard. He is wearing a khaki suit jacket over a lighter shade of khaki vest, a white collared shirt, and a burgundy tie. He appears to be speaking to the woman.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene is set within a room featuring light-colored walls and dark wood wainscoting. On the wall, two landscape paintings in dark wooden frames are visible. The smaller, more square painting and the larger, rectangular one both depict outdoor scenes in muted, earthy tones. The space is evenly lit by a warm, artificial light source.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a woman on the left and a man on the right, both positioned in the middle ground. In the background, a small painting is centered on the wall, with a larger painting to its right. Dark wood wainscoting is visible at the bottom of the frame. The camera remains static at the subjects' level throughout the scene.",
