    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a nighttime urban street scene, capturing the entire breadth of the street and surrounding buildings. Neon signs dominate the frame, positioned prominently in the middle ground and background, with their bright colors reflecting vividly on the wet pavement. Vehicles occupy the foreground and middle ground, moving along the street, while pedestrians appear intermittently in the middle ground. The camera maintains a consistent height, likely at the level of a vehicle's dashboard, providing a driver's perspective. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward steadily, causing the buildings and signs initially in the middle ground to shift towards the background, while new elements enter the frame from the front. The spatial dynamics emphasize the continuous flow of the street, with the camera's forward movement enhancing the sense of progression through the urban environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a vibrant urban environment at night, characterized by glowing neon signs and reflections on wet streets. The focus is on the atmosphere created by the interplay of artificial lights and the reflective surfaces, rather than any specific object. The scene conveys a sense of bustling nightlife and urban energy, emphasizing the scale and ambiance of the city rather than highlighting a particular subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a dashcam mounted on a vehicle, presents an urban street scene at night. The setting is outdoors, featuring a bustling city environment illuminated by vibrant neon lights in various colors, predominantly cyan, reds, greens, and some yellow. These lights reflect off the wet pavement, suggesting recent rain. The road is lined with buildings adorned with glowing signs, and street lights are also visible, creating a lively and colorful atmosphere. The street is active, with vehicles and pedestrians visible, contributing to the dynamic cityscape. The overall scene conveys a sense of motion as the vehicle moves through the illuminated urban landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
