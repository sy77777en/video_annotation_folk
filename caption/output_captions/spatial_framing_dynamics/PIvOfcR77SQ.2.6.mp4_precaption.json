    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the expansive snowy environment, highlighting the atmosphere and scale of the winter setting rather than any specific object. The wide view captures the overall ambiance and natural beauty of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a serene winter landscape in an outdoor rural setting, likely during the daytime under overcast skies. The ground is blanketed with thick, undisturbed snow, creating a smooth, white expanse. In the distance, several small, round structures with conical roofs are visible, possibly yurts, surrounded by numerous branched trees. The trees add vertical elements to the otherwise flat terrain. The camera pans to the right, transitioning from the yurts to a red wooden cabin in the midground, its vibrant color contrasting with the snow. The cabin's walls are made of horizontal wooden planks, and a small section of another wooden structure is visible on the right side of the frame in the foreground. The scene is calm, with no visible movement, emphasizing the stillness of the snowy environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a snowy landscape, capturing the expansive environment. Initially, the camera focuses on the left side of the scene, where several small, round structures with conical roofs are positioned in the middle ground, slightly towards the left. These structures are surrounded by numerous bare trees scattered across the flat terrain, which occupies the foreground and middle ground. As the camera pans to the right, the perspective shifts, bringing a red wooden cabin into the center of the frame. This cabin is located in the midground, closer to the right side of the scene. The cabin's vibrant color contrasts sharply with the white snow. A small section of another wooden structure becomes visible in the foreground on the far right. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a consistent height, positioned at a level that captures the full breadth of the snowy expanse and the structures within it. The sky remains overcast, forming the backdrop of the entire scene. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera height, ensuring a continuous and steady view of the serene winter landscape.",
