    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with short, dark brown hair and a light complexion is sitting on a bench. He wears a grey t-shirt, blue jeans, and white sneakers. He is focused on a black laptop resting on his lap, with both hands on the keyboard as if typing. The characters in the video appear faceless, resembling animated or stylized 3D models. In the background, there is a crowd of black, featureless human figures standing behind a metal barrier.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor public space, a person sits on a modern bench with a metallic frame, using a dark laptop. The floor is covered in patterned tiles in muted tones of blue and brown, with scattered trash, including discarded cups and pieces of paper, visible to the left. A patch of warm orange light is cast across the floor in front of the seated figure, located in the lower left corner. In the out-of-focus background, faceless black figures stand motionless beyond a set of white metal barricades, with a red warning sign with white lettering attached to the railing. A small watermark in white font is visible in the lower left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot, a young man is positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. He is seated on a bench that extends diagonally toward the right edge of the frame. In the foreground, at the bottom left, scattered trash lies on the floor within a patch of light. The background, visible in the upper half of the frame, is occupied by a crowd of figures standing behind metal barricades that recede from the middle ground on the right. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, slightly behind his left shoulder, creating an over-the-shoulder view of him and his laptop.",
