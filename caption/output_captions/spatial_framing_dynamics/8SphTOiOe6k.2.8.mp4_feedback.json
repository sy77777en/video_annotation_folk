    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot. Initially, two pedestrians are in the middle ground, walking from the right towards the center on a cobblestone path, while a cart with people is briefly visible in the background right, moving away from the camera. A small, arched stone bridge occupies the foreground center-left, with a traditional Japanese building in the middle ground to its left and behind it. A wooden sign is in the foreground left, and a stone pillar is in the foreground center, to the right of the bridge. As the camera pans left, the initial two pedestrians move towards the left side of the frame. The pan reveals more of the building complex, now in the center middle ground, featuring an entrance with a white banner, and a \"No Bicycle Parking\" sign to its left in the middle ground. A stone wall comes into view in the foreground, extending from the bottom left. By the end of the pan, this stone wall, topped by a wooden picket fence, stretches across the middle ground from left to right. Four new pedestrians are now visible in the middle ground, center-left, walking along the path beside this wall; two walk towards the camera and two walk away. Trees and bushes are present in the middle ground and background throughout the pan. The camera is positioned at the subjects' height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows several pedestrians walking along a cobblestone path next to a paved road in what appears to be a Japanese town or village setting. The pedestrians include two individuals walking towards the camera initially (one in a yellow jacket, one in a dark jacket), and on the far right side of the frame, a cart carrying two people is moving away from the camera. As the camera pans left, four individuals become visible in the middle-left of the frame; the two on the right are walking towards the camera, while the two on the left are walking away from it. Alongside the path are traditional Japanese-style buildings with tiled roofs and white walls, interspersed with various trees, including pines and some showing autumn colors. Stone elements like a small arched bridge, retaining walls, and inscribed pillars are visible. Various signs, including wooden informational boards, directional signs, and warning signs, are posted near the path and buildings. A low wooden fence runs along part of the stone wall.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene on a paved street in Japan during daylight hours. Adjacent to the street is a traditional Japanese building complex featuring white walls, dark wooden elements, and tiled roofs, fronted by a small, arched stone bridge over a rock-lined channel. A prominent white banner with black markings hangs near the entrance. The walkway is paved with stone slabs. Along the street, a low stone wall is topped by a simple wooden picket fence, behind which are green bushes and trees, some displaying autumn foliage. Various signs are visible, including wooden information boards with Japanese text, a circular red and white \"No Bicycle Parking\" sign, and an upright stone marker near the bridge. Pedestrians walk along the paved sidewalk beside the street. The camera pans to the left, causing the view to shift slightly and revealing more of the street and the people walking along the stone wall and fence.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
