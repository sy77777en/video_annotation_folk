    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a man with a light skin tone, dark curly hair, a mustache, and a short beard, who is seated slightly to the left of the center. He wears a light blue, fuzzy cardigan over a white tank top and purple trousers, with white nail polish on his fingernails, and is looking directly forward while bringing a coupe glass containing a pinkish liquid to his lips. On his right, another man in a colorful patterned shirt and orange pants is partially visible. Behind him to the left, a woman with dark hair and glasses holds a cigarette in her mouth. To the left of the main subject, a woman in a green pleated top is partially in view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit room with dark blue walls, where a group of people are gathered. The walls are decorated with framed pictures containing floral patterns, and a black shelf in the background holds several white candles. The subjects are positioned around a glass coffee table and on a red and white patterned couch. A man, slightly to the left of the center, wearing a light blue fuzzy cardigan and purple pants, holds a coupe glass containing a pink beverage. Other props include a pink tray and a clear glass decanter with a crystal stopper on the coffee table. The overall lighting is subdued, creating a dark, intimate atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium shot, filmed at the subjects' level, captures a man in a light blue cardigan positioned in the middle ground, just left of the frame's center. He holds a coupe glass centrally as he brings it to his lips. In the foreground at the bottom of the frame, a coffee table is visible. To the main subject's left, another man sits in the middle ground, partially seen in the top left corner. Directly behind the main subject in the middle ground is a woman with glasses, and to her right in the background is another person. A woman in a green top sits in the middle ground, occupying the bottom right of the frame. In the background at the top right, a shelf with candles is visible on the wall.",
