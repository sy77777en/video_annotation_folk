    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two human arms viewed through a glass door, which causes their hands to appear stained a dark bluish-green. The arm on the left is bare, muscular, and has a light skin tone, while the arm on the right is covered by a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt. Each arm throws a separate red, round tomato. The tomato on the right side of the frame has a small green sticker. Subsequently, the tomatoes are depicted splattering, with their red pulp and juice bursting outwards.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In bright daylight, this outdoor scene shows two red, round tomatoes being thrown towards a transparent glass surface in the foreground. A gold-colored door handle is affixed to the glass, on the right side of the frame. Behind the glass, a white, paneled garage door, featuring a small, circular metallic fixture that seems to be a lock, serves as the background. The right tomato has a small green sticker, which is occasionally visible as it spins through the air. Initially, two hands, appearing bluish-green, release the tomatoes. Upon impact with the glass, the tomatoes splatter, their red liquid and pulp spreading outwards. A dark shadow, resembling a person and likely belonging to the individual whose arm was on the left side of the frame. **\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a close-up shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. Initially, two arms are visible in the middle ground: the left arm is on the left side of the frame, and the right arm is on the right. Each hand holds a tomato, also in the middle ground. A transparent glass surface occupies the foreground across the entire frame, with a gold-colored door handle positioned on its right side. In the background, a white, paneled garage door with a small, circular metallic fixture slightly left of center is visible, along with a dark shadow in the bottom right, cast on this background door. The hands release the tomatoes, which then travel from their respective sides in the middle ground towards the foreground glass. The left tomato moves towards the left-center of the frame, and the right tomato, with a visible green sticker, moves towards the right-center. Both tomatoes subsequently impact and splatter on the foreground glass surface, with the left tomato hitting at left-center and the right tomato at right-center, their red pulp and juice spreading outwards on this surface.",
