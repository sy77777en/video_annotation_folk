    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a landscape scenery shot of a tranquil rural environment. A straight, light-colored concrete road stretches into the distance, flanked on both sides by vast, vibrant green rice paddies. The road is lined with simple, modern streetlights on both sides and small, newly planted trees on the left side. In the background, rolling green hills and mountains sit under a bright blue sky filled with large, fluffy white cumulus clouds. There is no main subject in this video, as the camera's steady forward movement along the road emphasizes the expansive scale and peaceful atmosphere of the countryside rather than focusing on a specific object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-moving view captures a straight, paved road running through a rural landscape on a bright, sunny day. On either side of the road, vast, vibrant green rice paddies extend toward a distant horizon of green hills and mountains. The sky above is a brilliant blue, filled with large, white, puffy clouds. Two lines of thin, gray metal poles, possibly for streetlights, run along both sides of the road. On the left side, a low hedge and a few small, newly planted trees are visible. In the distance, a few utility towers and the faint outlines of a village are visible at the base of the hills.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot with no main subject, captured in an extreme wide shot from a forward-moving perspective. A light-colored road begins at the bottom of the frame and extends into the middle ground, creating a central vanishing point. This road is flanked on the left and right by vast green rice paddies that occupy the middle ground. In the foreground and middle ground, lines of streetlight poles run along both sides of the road, with a low hedge and small trees positioned in the left foreground. The background is composed of green hills spanning the horizon, situated below a sky that fills the upper half of the frame with large clouds. The camera moves steadily forward, initially positioned on the left side of the road before panning slightly to the right to center the path. This movement causes foreground elements to move toward the bottom of the frame and out of view, enhancing the sense of depth against the relatively static background. The camera is positioned at a low height, looking straight down the road.",
