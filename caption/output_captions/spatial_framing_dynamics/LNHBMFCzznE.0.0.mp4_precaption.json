    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged, light-skinned woman with shoulder-length brown hair stands on a red carpet on a stage. She is wearing a dark gray, sleeveless, knee-length dress and tall black boots. Positioned in profile, she faces towards the right side of the scene. She holds a small, dark object, likely a presentation remote, in her hands, appearing to be in the process of giving a speech.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place on a dimly lit stage, featuring a raised platform with a bright red carpet. In the background, two distinct structures are illuminated with blue light. On the left, a tall, white, vertically slatted wall is marked with the number \"1733.\" To the right, a large installation is composed of numerous stacked, circular objects, creating a textured, glowing blue wall. The overall lighting is dramatic, with spotlights highlighting the background elements and the central area of the stage, while the surrounding space remains dark.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A woman is captured in a full shot, positioned on the left side of the frame. She stands in the foreground on a red carpet atop a raised stage. In the background, a tall, white, slatted wall with the number \"1733\" is visible on the far left. To the center-right in the background, a large installation of stacked, circular objects is illuminated in blue. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level.",
