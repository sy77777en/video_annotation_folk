    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a small monitor in the right foreground, which is in focus. In the left background, an Xbox console and controller are visible but out of focus. The camera's focus then smoothly shifts from the foreground monitor to the controller. The shot becomes a full shot of the Xbox controller, now in sharp focus in the left midground. The monitor becomes an out-of-focus element in the right background, while the console remains blurred in the left background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens with a focused view of a small, black, boxy monitor displaying the green-tinted original Xbox dashboard. The menu, featuring options like \"MEMORY,\" \"MUSIC,\" \"XBOX LIVE,\" and \"SETTINGS,\" surrounds a large, translucent green Xbox logo. In the blurred background, a black Xbox console is partially visible. The focus then smoothly shifts from the monitor to a large, black original Xbox controller, which appears to float in the midground. The controller has a prominent, glowing yellow and green \"XBOX\" logo at its center, while the monitor goes out of focus and the console remains out of focus throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, the scene is dominated by a green color scheme, with black elements created by shadows. An original Xbox console and controller are displayed. In the foreground, a small, boxy monitor with a green-tinted screen shows the classic Xbox dashboard menu, featuring a large, translucent green logo and options for \"MEMORY,\" \"MUSIC,\" \"XBOX LIVE,\" and \"SETTINGS.\" To the left, the black console and a large, black original Xbox controller are visible, with the controller's central logo illuminated.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
