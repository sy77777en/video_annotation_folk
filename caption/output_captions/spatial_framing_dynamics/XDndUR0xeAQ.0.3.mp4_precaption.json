    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a low-angle shot of a person's feet in black shoes and the cuffs of wide-legged black trousers. On the floor to the left is a crumpled cloth of purple fabric with a white pattern. The view tilts upward to reveal the full figure of an extremely muscular, dark-skinned man. He is shirtless, displaying a highly defined chest, abdomen, and arms, and wears the black trousers with a silver belt buckle. The man has hair in the middle of his head, a thin mustache, and a slight smile as he stands facing forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors within a large room, illuminated by overhead light fixtures. The camera begins with a low-angle view of a plain, light-colored floor, where a crumpled cloth of purple fabric with a white, swirling pattern rests on the left. The perspective slowly tilts upward, revealing the expansive room flanked on both sides by tall, dark bookshelves packed with books, which are blurred in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a low-angle close-up shot focused on a person's feet and lower legs, which are positioned in the center foreground. To the bottom left, a crumpled purple cloth rests on the floor, also in the foreground. The background consists of blurred bookshelves. The camera then tilts upward, revealing the muscular upper body of a man. This movement transitions the frame into a low-angle medium shot, with the man remaining centered in the foreground, towering over the camera's perspective.",
