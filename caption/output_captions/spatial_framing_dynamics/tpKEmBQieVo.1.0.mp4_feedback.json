    "pre_caption": "The camera is mounted on the back of a person's helmet, providing a point-of-view perspective looking upwards. Initially, the person's wingsuit occupies the bottom foreground of the frame, with their shoulders and the back of their helmet visible. A dark, rocky mountain formation is in the middle ground, positioned centrally and extending towards the top left and top right, framing a patch of blue sky with white clouds in the top center background. As the video progresses, the person appears to ascend rapidly. The wingsuit remains in the bottom foreground, with the \"wings\" spreading slightly to the bottom left and bottom right. The mountain transforms into a towering, sheer cliff face that moves downwards in the frame, coming to dominate the middle ground and background, filling most of the view above the person. The visible area of sky and clouds in the top background diminishes as the cliff face rises to occupy more of the upper frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video offers a perspective from a camera mounted behind a person's head. The person's wearing a wingsuit, which is predominantly black and bright yellow-green, with blue trim accents. A white \"GoPro\" logo is visible on the back of the suit. The view includes the yellow bottom part of the helmet. The background features brown mountains, a blue sky, and white clouds.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted on the back of a person's helmet, shows a rapid ascent or flight very close to a sheer, towering rock cliff face. The cliff, predominantly brownish-grey with a rough texture, rises steeply against a backdrop of blue sky interspersed with large, white, fluffy clouds. The bottom of the helmet is visible in the frame, and the wingsuit, featuring black and bright yellow/lime green fabric with blue trim, has a \"GoPro\" logo on the back. In the distance, another rocky slope with patches of snow can be seen. The perspective gives a sense of extreme proximity to the imposing rock formations.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
