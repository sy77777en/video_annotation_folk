    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large group of identical, mannequin-like figures with pale, grayish-white skin and bald heads stands in disorganized rows. All the figures are dressed in form-fitting, long-sleeved orange jumpsuits. One figure stands apart from the group, positioned behind a simple wooden lectern. The rest of the figures stand at attention, facing forward. A few of the figures in the crowd have black and white patterns on their heads, distinguishing them from the otherwise uniform assembly.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a large, dimly lit room with brown wood-paneled walls, a group of humanoid figures in orange jumpsuits stands in disorganized rows on a dark gray checkered floor. The figures, who have pale white heads and hands, are all facing forward. There's a single wooden lectern in the middleground in front of them, where another similar figure stands. Some of the figures' heads feature black and white patterns. The scene is illuminated from above, casting shadows across the floor. An overlay of white text appears at the bottom-left of the scene, reading, '[28]'.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot captured from a high angle, a large group of figures in orange jumpsuits occupies the center and left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a dark checkered floor. To the bottom right, another figure stands behind a wooden lectern, positioned slightly in the foreground relative to the main group. The entire scene is enclosed by dark, wood-paneled walls in the background. The camera and all elements within the frame remain completely still.",
