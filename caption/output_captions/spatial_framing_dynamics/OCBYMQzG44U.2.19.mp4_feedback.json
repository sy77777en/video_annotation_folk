    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, wide scenery shot from a low-angle perspective at water level. Dark, rippling water fills the foreground and the bottom portion of the frame. In the middle ground, a dark, circular opening is positioned in the center, set into a wall of white tiles that extends into the background. To the right in the background, a set of white stairs ascends out of the water. The tiled ceiling and overhead lights are visible at the top of the frame in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an interior scenery shot of a liminal, pool-like environment. Filmed from a low angle at the surface of dark, murky water, the scene captures a large room where the walls are covered in small, white, grid-like tiles. Overhead fluorescent lights cast a white, institutional glow on the scene, illuminating a dark, circular tunnel opening at the waterline on the far wall and a set of white, tiled stairs ascending out of the water on the right. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is entirely on the unsettling atmosphere of the environment. The composition emphasizes the strange, empty space rather than any specific entity within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person point of view at water level, the scene is set within a large, indoor pool area. The camera is positioned in dark, rippling water, looking across the surface. The surrounding walls are covered in a grid of small, off-white square tiles, which reflect the glow from rectangular light fixtures on the ceiling. Directly ahead, a large, circular, black opening is embedded in the tiled wall at the water's edge. In the background to the right, a set of wide, white stairs ascends out of the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
