    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a group of men occupies the center of the frame, walking forward along a paved walkway. A man in a blue blazer is positioned in the foreground-left, while three other men\u2014one in a blue suit and two in black coats\u2014are arranged across the foreground-center and foreground-right. In the middle ground, other men and a small child walk behind the main group. The scene is flanked by two long buildings on the left and right, extending from the foreground into the background. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, moves backward to track the group's advance, maintaining their central position within the frame. A text overlay is visible in the bottom-left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of men walks together. In the foreground, a tall man on the right with dark hair wears a black coat. To his right, a man in a black coat over a white collared shirt is speaking. Next to him is a man in a blue suit with a green tie and a beard. On the far left, a man with long, dark, wavy hair, wearing a dark blue blazer over a light blue shirt, holds his hand to his mouth. In the background, other men accompany the group, and a small child in a red sweater is visible among them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A group of men in suits and coats walks along a paved outdoor walkway situated between two long, identical, single-story buildings. The buildings feature white walls, red-tiled roofs, and are lined with large, brown, grid-like ventilation units. The scene is set during the day under an overcast sky. The camera maintains a low angle and moves backward in front of the advancing group. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays white text that reads, \"\u00c7iftlik Bank - Mavi Yumurta Sakarya Tesisi A\u00e7\u0131l\u0131\u015f Klibi (2017)\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
