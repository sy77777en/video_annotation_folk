    "pre_caption": "This is a static, extreme wide scenery shot captured from a high-angle perspective, looking down on the landscape. The top two-thirds of the frame are dominated by a vast sky of dark clouds in the background. A vibrant sunset with visible rain is positioned in the center of the frame along the horizon, also in the background. Two parallel highways originate in the foreground at the bottom left and bottom right corners, extending through the middle ground and converging toward the central vanishing point at the sunset. The dark landscape fills the lower portion of the frame, flanking the highways on the left and right from the foreground into the middle ground, with distant mountains silhouetted in the background. The time-lapse captures traffic as streaks of light moving away from the camera on the right highway and towards the camera on the left highway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic time-lapse landscape scenery shot. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky filled with deep blue and purple storm clouds, which contrast sharply with a fiery orange and red sunset glowing on the horizon. Sheets of rain are visible in the distance, illuminated by the setting sun. Below, two parallel highways stretch through the darkened, expansive terrain, converging toward the distant light. Headlights and taillights of cars and trucks blur into streaks of light as they travel along the roads. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural environment, with the highway serving to guide the eye and provide a sense of journey through the epic scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a level-angle perspective, a divided highway cuts through a vast, dark landscape, its parallel asphalt roads converging toward the horizon. The sky above is filled with turbulent, deep blue clouds. Below this dark cloud cover, a vibrant sunset casts a fiery orange and yellow glow across the horizon, illuminating distinct shafts of rain falling in the distance. The surrounding terrain and distant mountains are visible as dark silhouettes against the bright sky. A time-lapse captures the flow of traffic, with the headlights and taillights of cars and trucks creating streaks of light as they travel in both directions along the highway.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
