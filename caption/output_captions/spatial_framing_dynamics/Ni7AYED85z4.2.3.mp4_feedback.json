    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing the main subject\u2014a man in a dark blue jacket and light blue jeans\u2014standing near the bottom right of the frame in the foreground, facing toward the center left where the street musician is seated in the middle ground. The musician, with a guitar and a hat for tips on the ground, is positioned left of center in the frame and also in the middle ground. Several other people are scattered throughout the plaza, mostly in the background and middle ground, with some groups standing or walking across the open space, distributed from left to right. The camera is at the same height as the main subject, providing a level perspective. The visible camera interface overlay at the bottom of the frame reinforces the first-person point of view, with the camera body and lens occupying the bottom center foreground. The buildings and caf\u00e9 tables with umbrellas form the background, stretching across the top and sides of the frame, while the sky fills the uppermost portion. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positions during the video; the framing remains stable, maintaining the spatial relationships between the main subject, musician, and surrounding elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with light skin, gray hair, and a short gray beard, who appears to be middle-aged and is wearing a dark blue jacket and light blue jeans; he stands with his hands in his pockets, facing toward a street musician. The musician, who is also a man with light skin and dark hair, is seated and playing an acoustic guitar; he wears a dark jacket and pants, and has a hat placed on the ground in front of him for tips. Several other people are present in the scene, including small groups and individuals walking or standing nearby, most dressed in casual clothing such as jackets and jeans. The main subject\u2019s attention is directed toward the musician, while the other people appear to be either passing by or observing from a distance, establishing the musician as the focal point of the main subject\u2019s interest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, shows an outdoor plaza bordered by tall, reddish-brown and beige buildings with green shutters and arched windows, some featuring ornate stonework. The ground is paved with large, light gray stone tiles. Several groups of people are scattered throughout the open space, some standing and others walking, while a street musician sits on a low stool playing a guitar near an open instrument case and a hat placed on the ground. To one side, a man in a dark jacket and jeans stands with his hands in his pockets, facing the musician. Outdoor caf\u00e9 tables with umbrellas line the edge of the plaza, and the sky above is partly cloudy. Towards the end of the video, a camera slightly emerges from the bottom of the frame, indicating the perspective of someone actively recording or observing the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
