    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large African elephant prominently in the foreground. The elephant has a textured, gray skin with visible wrinkles and large, fan-like ears. Its tusks are long and curved, with a slightly worn appearance. The elephant's trunk is thick and muscular, hanging down in front of its face. Its eyes are small and dark, set beneath a prominent brow. The elephant is facing forward, occupying most of the frame, showcasing its massive size and distinctive features.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene in a natural environment, featuring a large elephant as the central subject. The setting is a rugged landscape with rocky hills in the background, suggesting a savanna or similar habitat. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, with soft, natural lighting highlighting the textures and details of the elephant's skin and tusks. The elephant's skin is gray and textured, with prominent wrinkles and markings, while its tusks are curved and ivory-colored. The surrounding vegetation is sparse, with patches of dry grass and low shrubs. The overall atmosphere is calm and serene, with the elephant standing prominently in the foreground, providing a sense of scale and presence within the expansive landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot, centering on the elephant's head and tusks, which occupy the foreground. The tusks point towards the bottom left and bottom right corners. A blurred hillside forms the background, visible mainly in the top right. The shot then transitions to a medium shot, revealing more of the elephant's upper body and shoulders. During this transition, the elephant's head shifts slightly towards the top left of the frame while remaining in the foreground. The background hillside becomes more visible across the top and right side of the frame. The camera remains at the elephant's level throughout.",
