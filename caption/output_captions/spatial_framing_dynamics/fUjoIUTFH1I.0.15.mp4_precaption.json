    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a serene cityscape of the French Quarter in New Orleans, beautifully enveloped in a thick, gray fog. The focus is on the moody, still atmosphere of the environment, with muted gray and brick buildings featuring characteristic wrought-iron balconies adorned with hanging flower baskets lining the wet, empty street. While some parked cars are visible at the end of the street, the dense fog softens the architectural details in the distance, creating a sense of quiet solitude and emphasizing the classic design of the buildings in the foreground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A quiet, foggy street in what appears to be the French Quarter of New Orleans is lined with historic buildings. The main structure is a multi-story, gray-painted building featuring a prominent second-floor balcony with ornate black wrought-iron railings, supported by slender black posts. Hanging planters with yellow and pink flowers adorn the balcony. The ground floor of the building has a series of arched doorways with black grilles, and the upper-story windows are framed by black shutters.  The damp asphalt street recedes into the dense fog, where other brick and stucco buildings with similar balconies are faintly visible. A portion of a white car is seen in the lower-left corner.As the camera pans to the right, additional details come into view, including several parked cars at the end of the street and a streetlight that becomes visible towards the conclusion of the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot captured from street level. Initially, a large, gray building with a prominent balcony occupies the foreground and middle ground, stretching from the left to the center of the frame. A street is positioned at the bottom, receding into the foggy background. To the right, another building is visible in the middle ground. The camera then pans slowly to the right, causing the gray building to shift toward the left edge of the frame. This movement reveals more of the street and the buildings on the right, bringing a streetlight and several parked cars into view in the middle ground. A portion of a white car, initially in the bottom-left foreground, exits the frame as the pan progresses.",
