    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an interior scenery shot depicting a dimly lit apartment entryway at night. A dark wooden door stands slightly ajar in the center of the frame, with a bright sliver of light peeking out from the bottom. To the left, a warm glow emanates from a lamp with a white shade resting on a wooden console table, which also holds a few framed photographs. To the right of the door, a low shoe rack sits beneath a large framed piece of art, and the silhouette of a houseplant is visible in the corner. The shot lacks a main subject, as the focus is on the quiet, atmospheric environment. The moody, low-key lighting and static composition emphasize the setting itself, creating a sense of stillness and anticipation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit entryway of a home, a dark wooden door is positioned in the center, slightly ajar with light seeping from underneath. To the left of the door, a wooden console table holds a lit lamp with a white shade, two framed photographs, and a small bowl. A standing coat rack stands in the far-left corner, and a small, framed picture hangs on the off-white wall above the table. To the right of the door, a low, light-colored wooden shoe rack holds a pair of white sneakers, positioned next to a potted plant with dark leaves. A large, vertically oriented framed artwork hangs on the wall above the shoe rack. The scene is illuminated primarily by the single lamp, which casts long shadows across the room and onto the dark wood floor.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of a home entryway, captured from a low camera angle. The scene is composed with a dark wooden door positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. To the left of the door, a wooden console table with a lit lamp sits in the middle ground, with a coat rack visible in the far-left corner. To the right of the door, a low shoe rack is placed in the middle ground, with a large framed artwork on the wall above it and a potted plant in the far-right corner. The wooden floor and a rug occupy the foreground. The framing and position of all elements remain constant throughout the shot.",
