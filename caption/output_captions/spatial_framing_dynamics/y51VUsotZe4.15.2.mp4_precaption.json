    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A red sedan, identifiable by the yellow car topper sign on its roof, is shown on a wide, multi-lane bridge at night. The car is centered on the road, consistently approaching the viewer with its headlights on. The bridge is defined by two long, symmetrical rows of tall, slender streetlights, one on each side. The lights are illuminated, casting a warm glow onto the road surface and creating a visual corridor that recedes into the darkness.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, a single car with its headlights illuminated drives toward the camera on a wide, multi-lane overpass. The dark, paved road is marked with a central yellow double line. Symmetrical rows of tall, slender streetlights line both sides of the overpass, their warm, orange-yellow glow casting light onto the road and creating a receding perspective against the black sky. In the distance, the out-of-focus lights of a city create a soft, blurred backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, capturing a red sedan in the center middle ground of the frame. The car is positioned on a wide bridge that occupies the bottom portion of the screen, extending from the foreground into the distance. Symmetrical rows of streetlights line the left and right sides of the bridge, creating leading lines that converge toward the background, where out-of-focus city lights are visible. As the car drives directly toward the camera, it moves from the middle ground to the foreground, causing the shot to transition into a wide shot. Throughout this movement, the car remains centered, and the camera maintains a high-angle perspective, looking down on the scene.",
