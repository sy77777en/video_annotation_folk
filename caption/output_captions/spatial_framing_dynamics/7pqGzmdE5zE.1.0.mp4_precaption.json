    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a static architectural scenery shot of a multi-story, white-walled building against a dark night sky. There is no main subject, as the composition emphasizes the building's structure and the quiet, nocturnal atmosphere. The facade is characterized by a mix of rectangular and arched windows, with a prominent black metal fire escape running down the center. A few windows are illuminated with a warm, interior light, while a streetlamp casts a brighter, cooler light across the building, creating distinct shadows and highlighting its textures. In the background, the silhouettes of tall palm trees are visible, reinforcing the urban setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, a static shot shows the facade of a light-colored, multi-story apartment building against a dark sky, with the sound of crickets chirping. A black metal fire escape runs down the center of the building, with landings on each floor and a small balcony on the top level. Several windows, both rectangular and arched, are illuminated from within, casting a warm light. A streetlamp on the right side of the scene also casts light onto the building. On the far left, a large, dark, stylized logo is painted on the wall. The silhouettes of tall palm trees are visible on the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This static wide shot focuses on a multi-story building that fills the center of the frame. A black metal fire escape runs vertically down the middle of the building's facade. In the middle ground on the right, a streetlamp casts light across the scene. Several windows are illuminated, including one in the top center and a few in the top right. On the far left, a large logo is painted on an adjacent wall. In the background on the right, the silhouettes of palm trees are visible against the dark sky. Dark bushes occupy the foreground in the bottom left corner. The camera remains stationary at a straight-on angle, level with the lower portion of the building.",
