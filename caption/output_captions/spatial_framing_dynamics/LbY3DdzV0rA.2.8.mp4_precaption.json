    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot of a desert environment under a turbulent sky. The composition lacks a single main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural environment. A massive, dark purple and grey storm cloud dominates the frame, appearing to swirl and advance in a time-lapse motion, with visible sheets of rain falling in the distance on the left. In stark contrast, the right side of the sky reveals patches of pale blue and soft, light-colored clouds, suggesting the scene is set during sunrise or sunset. The foreground is a vast, arid plain dotted with sparse desert scrub, leading back to a silhouette of dark mountains on the distant horizon.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse video shows a vast desert landscape under a dynamic sky at either dawn or dusk. The foreground and middle ground feature a flat, arid plain with scattered, low-lying shrubs. In the distance, a dark mountain range rests on the horizon. A massive, swirling storm cloud, colored in shades of purple and dark gray, dominates the left and central parts of the sky, with rain visible falling from its base. To the right, the sky is lighter, with patches of white clouds against a pale blue background.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a desert landscape, with the focus on the scenery rather than a specific subject. The bottom third of the frame is occupied by the foreground, a flat, arid plain with scattered shrubs that extends into the middle ground. In the background, a dark mountain range rests on the horizon, stretching across the width of the scene. The top two-thirds of the frame are dominated by the sky, where a massive, dark storm cloud occupies the top left and center. This cloud appears to swirl and advance in a time-lapse motion, with rain visible falling from its base in the left middle ground. The top right of the frame contains a lighter portion of the sky with pale blue and white clouds. The camera is positioned at a low height, looking across the desert floor toward the horizon.",
