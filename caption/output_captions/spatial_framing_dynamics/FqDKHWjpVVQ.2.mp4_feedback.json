    "pre_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective. Initially, a dark military vehicle, marked as a target, is positioned center-right in the middle ground, moving slightly towards the center. To its right, a stationary white sedan is visible in the middle ground, while a partial view of another white vehicle occupies the bottom right foreground. Game interface elements are fixed: a minimap in the bottom left foreground and health/ammo indicators in the bottom right foreground. Orange objective markers are superimposed, one in the top left background, another on the left in the middle ground, and one on the target vehicle. As the viewpoint advances forward and slightly right, then more directly forward, the target military vehicle shifts to the center and then slightly left of center in the middle ground, becoming larger in the frame. The stationary white sedan on the right moves towards the right edge of the frame and then exits. The objective marker on the left also shifts towards the left edge. Debris and crates, initially on the left in the middle ground, move towards the left edge and out of view. By the end of the clip, the target military vehicle is positioned centrally in the middle ground, closer to the viewpoint.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a first-person perspective from a video game. A dark, angular military vehicle, possibly an armored truck with a mounted weapon system, is prominent in the midground, moving along a dirt road. This vehicle is marked with orange and blue digital icons, including numbers that decrease (e.g., \"30\", \"23\", \"16\") and the word \"ATTACK,\" indicating it as a target. To the right of the road, two stationary white, four-door sedans are parked. The sedan closer to the viewer is facing right, while the one farther away is facing left. In the foreground, elements of a game interface are visible: a minimap in the bottom left corner displays a blue arrow and other icons, with green subtitles positioned next to the blue map; health and ammunition indicators in the bottom right show \"100%\" and \"101/101\" in a blue digital font; and additional orange diamond-shaped objective markers with numbers like \"103\" and \"86\" are superimposed on structures in the distance. A partial view of another vehicle, with a white body and blue from floating game icons, is seen in the bottom right foreground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moves through a sunlit, outdoor urban environment. The setting is a dusty, unpaved road flanked by simple, light-colored buildings, some appearing worn. Palm trees and other green vegetation are visible. Two white sedans are parked on the right side of the road. In the center of the road, a dark, boxy, turreted military-like object with glowing orange and blue elements is approached. Scattered debris, including wooden crates, litters the ground. The sky is clear. Overlay elements include a mini-map and green text in the bottom left; targeting reticles, orange diamond icons with numbers, and the word \"ATTACK\" near the center; and a blue numerical display in the bottom right. Additional orange diamond icons with numbers are visible near buildings on the left.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
