    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a dimly lit room where a pair of legs, clad in dark pants and dark shoes, hangs motionlessly from the middle top of the frame, suggesting a hanging person. Directly beneath these suspended legs, a small, child-like figure wearing a bright yellow hooded raincoat is attempting to move a simple wooden chair. A single dark shoe lies on the floor near the chair. Additionally, a roll of paper towels is seen on the floor, rolling towards the left side of the frame, located in the middle left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person 3D game video shows a dimly lit indoor room with dark wooden plank flooring. A single spotlight illuminates the center, where a pair of legs in dark pants and shoes hangs from above. Directly beneath, a small, light brown wooden chair stands, with a small figure in a yellow raincoat initially standing beside it and then attempting to pull the chair towards the right side. To the left, a bare mattress leans against the dark wall, and a roll of white toilet paper rolls from the middle to the left side. Near the chair, a dark hat and a white piece of paper are visible on the floor. Scattered wooden planks are present in the room. The background walls are dark, with some visible pipes and a wooden door with an eye-like design on the right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot, with the camera positioned above the subjects. In the center-top middle ground, a pair of legs hangs motionlessly. Directly beneath, in the center middle ground, a small figure in a yellow raincoat is initially positioned to the right of a wooden chair, then pulls the chair slightly further to the right; both the figure and chair remain in the middle ground during this movement. A single dark shoe, a dark hat, and a white piece of paper lie on the floor in the center middle ground near the chair's initial position. A roll of paper is seen in the middle-left middle ground, rolling towards the left edge of the frame. A bare mattress is positioned on the left in the background, while a wooden door with an eye-like design and some pipes are visible on the right in the background.",
