    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man with short, afro-textured hair is shown from the waist up in a selfie-style view. He is smiling broadly, showing his teeth, and looking toward the camera. He is wearing a bright pink, short-sleeved t-shirt and has a black watch on his right wrist. He appears to be in the middle of a run, with his body angled.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a selfie POV shot where the camera is held by the person being filmed, a person in a pink shirt moves along a wide, paved waterfront promenade on a sunny day. A metal and wire mesh fence with dark posts lines the edge of the walkway, separating it from a large body of water. Across the water, the dense skyline of Lower Manhattan stands under a blue sky with scattered white clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a man is positioned in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame, holding the camera for a selfie-style perspective. He is on a paved promenade that occupies the bottom of the frame. A fence runs horizontally across the middle ground, separating the promenade from a body of water. In the background, a city skyline stretches across the upper half of the frame. As the man moves forward, the background scenery pans from right to left. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
