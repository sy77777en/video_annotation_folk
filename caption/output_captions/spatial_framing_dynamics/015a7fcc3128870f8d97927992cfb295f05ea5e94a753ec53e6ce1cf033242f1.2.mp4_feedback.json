    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of a woman, capturing her from the chest up. She is positioned centrally in the foreground, with her upper body and face clearly visible. The camera is at her eye level, providing a direct view. In the background, the indoor setting features pendant lights hanging from the ceiling, black rods, and woven bamboo objects suspended from above. These elements are arranged symmetrically, with some positioned towards the top left and right of the frame. The walls are plain and light-colored, forming the backdrop. As the video progresses, the woman gradually moves out of the frame, shifting towards the right side until she is no longer visible. This transition leaves the scene empty, focusing solely on the interior space. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining its initial position and angle, capturing the room's details more prominently as the subject exits. The final shot emphasizes the pendant lights, bamboo objects, and the overall minimalist decor, now occupying the central area of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with dark brown hair styled in an updo. She is wearing a white top, a large gold statement necklace, and earrings. Her expression is neutral, and she is facing forward. The woman gradually disappears from the frame, leaving the scene empty.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a modern, minimalist space with a neutral color palette. The environment features a series of pendant lights hanging from the ceiling, casting a soft glow. Black rods, likely part of the set design, are noticeable, from which several woven bamboo cage-like objects are hanging, adding an intriguing element to the decor. The walls are plain and light-colored, contributing to the clean and uncluttered aesthetic. The setting includes a few decorative elements, such as dried floral arrangements, adding a touch of natural texture. The lighting is consistent, suggesting an artificial, controlled environment without any indication of the time of day. The overall atmosphere is calm and composed, with a focus on simplicity and elegance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
