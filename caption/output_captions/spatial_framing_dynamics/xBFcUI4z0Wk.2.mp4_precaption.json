    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white Ford race car, numbered 98 in red with blue and red graphics, is stopped on the inside edge of a racetrack, partially on the grass, with its front end heavily damaged. Just behind it on the track, a black and yellow race car with the number 2 on its side emits white smoke. Further up the track, a white and black race car is seen driving normally. In the foreground, a blue and white race car drives past the scene, and the front of a red and yellow car is partially visible at the bottom left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at a paved, banked racetrack at night, illuminated by bright lights. The dark asphalt surface, marked with black tire scuffs and double yellow lines, curves around a green grass infield that has blue and white logos painted on it. In the background, empty grandstands and a catch fence line the outer edge of the track. Two race cars are involved in a crash on the turn. A white and blue car with the number 98 is stopped on the grass, its front end visibly damaged. On the track, a black and yellow car with the number 2 is stationary, creating a cloud of white smoke. Other cars pass by the incident on the lower part of the track, driving normally.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This high-angle wide shot captures a crash scene on a banked racetrack. In the middle ground, a damaged white car, number 98, is stationary in the center-right of the frame, positioned on the edge of the grass infield. Just behind it, in the center, a black and yellow car, number 2, is also stationary and emitting smoke. In the background at the top left, another car drives away along the upper part of the track. In the foreground, a blue and white car moves from the bottom left across the lower portion of the frame, while the front of a red and yellow car is partially visible in the bottom left corner. The track itself curves from the bottom left towards the top right, with grandstands visible in the background at the top of the frame.",
