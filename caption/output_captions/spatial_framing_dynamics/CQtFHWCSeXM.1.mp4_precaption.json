    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a large, two-story brick house. There is no main subject, as the camera's perspective is intended to capture the overall environment and architectural style of the residence rather than a specific person or object. The house features a red brick facade, a dark grey gabled roof, and a section of white stucco with dark half-timbering, characteristic of a Tudor revival style. A prominent chimney rises from the roofline, and an arched wooden door marks the entrance. The property is enclosed by a black metal fence, behind which lies a green lawn and various plants, including a distinctive, multi-trunked yucca tree in the middleground and the top of a palm tree visible in the middleground. The scene is set under a bright, overcast sky, creating a neutral and observational atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place during the daytime under an overcast sky, showing a large, two-story brick house from an exterior perspective. The house features a reddish-brown brick facade, a dark gray shingled roof, and a prominent brick chimney. An upper section of the house displays a Tudor-style design with white stucco and dark blue-gray half-timbering. In the foreground, a black metal fence with spear-point finials separates the property from the viewer. Behind the fence is a manicured green lawn with a few small blue and white security signs. The landscaping includes a tall, multi-trunked yucca tree with spiky green leaves in front of the house, a bare deciduous tree to the left, and palm trees visible behind the roofline. The camera zooms in, focusing on the upper portion of the house and its distinctive timbered detail.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This scenery video begins with a wide shot of a large house, captured from a low angle. In the foreground, a black metal fence extends across the bottom of the frame. The middle ground is occupied by the two-story brick house, which fills the center and right portions of the scene, with a bare tree on the left and a multi-trunked yucca tree in the center. A palm tree is visible in the background, rising above the house on the left, under an overcast sky at the top of the frame. The camera then slowly zooms in, transitioning to a medium shot that focuses on the upper section of the house. In the final frame, the Tudor-style half-timbering is centered, with the yucca tree still in the middle ground in front of it, and a window is positioned to the right.",
