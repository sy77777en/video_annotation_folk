    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the video, a light-skinned young adult man with short brown hair sits facing the camera. He is wearing a white t-shirt underneath an unbuttoned red and black plaid flannel shirt and has a white watch on his left wrist. He is positioned centrally at a desk, seated in a black gaming chair, with his hands resting near a keyboard. A black microphone on a stand is placed in front of him, slightly to his right and to the left of the screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors in a room with white walls, which appear dark due to dim lighting, and a sloped ceiling section. A person is seated in a black DXRacer gaming chair at a dark desk. A black cylindrical microphone on a boom arm is positioned in front of him. On the desk, a light-colored keyboard, a small potted plant, and a white rectangular object with \"SIMPLE\" printed on it are visible next to a dark monitor on the left. The background is illuminated by red light on the left wall and blue light on the right wall, where a circular fan is mounted. The structure beside the sloped ceiling resembles a vent, creating the appearance of a dark void. The camera provides an objective POV shot, capturing the scene from a detached, observational perspective.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a young adult man positioned centrally in the middle ground, seated at a desk. A black microphone on a stand is in the middle ground, in front of him and slightly to the viewer's left. His hands rest near a light-colored keyboard in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame. He is in a black gaming chair, also in the middle ground. To the left, a dark monitor, a small potted plant, and a white rectangular object are visible on the desk in the middle ground. The background features a sloped ceiling at the top, with red light illuminating the left wall and blue light on the right wall where a circular fan is mounted. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
