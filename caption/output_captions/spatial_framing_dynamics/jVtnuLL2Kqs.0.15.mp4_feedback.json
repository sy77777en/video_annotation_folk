    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a stone church tower and spire, which dominates the center of the frame and occupies the foreground, with the sky filling the background. The camera is positioned below the tower, looking up at a low angle, emphasizing the height of the structure. As the camera pulls back, the shot transitions to an extreme wide shot, revealing the broader city street scene. In this wider view, the church tower shifts to the center middle ground, while modern glass-fronted office buildings and older brick structures appear on the left and right sides of the frame, extending into the background. The paved pedestrian walkway and bollards are visible at the bottom of the frame in the foreground, and trees line the street along the middle ground. The camera remains at a low height relative to the buildings throughout, maintaining a slightly upward perspective. A small white watermark logo is present in the lower right corner of the frame in the foreground. The spatial framing emphasizes the scale and relationship between the historical tower and its urban surroundings, with the camera movement smoothly expanding the viewer\u2019s perspective from a focused architectural detail to the full cityscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, beginning with a low-angle view of a weathered, old stone church tower and its spire set against a bright, partly cloudy sky. As the camera pulls back, it reveals the tower's context within a bustling city street, flanked by a mix of modern glass-fronted office buildings and older brick structures. The shot does not have a main subject; instead, the focus is on the architectural atmosphere and the juxtaposition of historical and contemporary design. The camera's movement serves to establish the scale of the environment, emphasizing the place itself rather than any single entity within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors in an urban environment, featuring a prominent stone clock tower with a domed top and arched openings, surrounded by multi-story buildings with large windows and varied architectural styles. The sky is partly cloudy, with sunlight casting shadows on the structures and the paved street below. The scene includes a wide pedestrian walkway lined with bollards and some trees, with the buildings displaying a mix of light and dark facades. The weather is clear, and the time of day appears to be late morning or early afternoon, as indicated by the bright daylight and the angle of the shadows. Overlay elements are present, including a small, white watermark in the lower right corner, which is the logo of IO Interactive. It features two bold white letters, \"IK\" and \"KI,\" symmetrically arranged to create a mirrored appearance, with the space between these letters forming a diamond-shaped outline and a small triangle positioned above and below the diamond. The video transitions smoothly between different vantage points, showing the tower from both a low angle and a broader street view, while maintaining a consistent urban setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.",
