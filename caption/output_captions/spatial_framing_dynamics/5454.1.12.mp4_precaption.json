    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark-skinned man with cornrows and tattoos on his forehead is shown sitting in the back of a black luxury car. He is wearing black sunglasses and a black shirt and is visible from the shoulders up through the open rear window, which has a silver trim. In the background, two other people are visible but out of focus; one wears a tan jacket, while the other is dressed in darker clothing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a residential street under a sky that appears closer to sunset, casting a warm glow. A black luxury sedan with a silver chrome trim along its window line is positioned in the foreground. The rear passenger window is down, revealing a portion of the car's light-colored interior and a person with braided hair and dark sunglasses looking out. In the blurred background, two-story residential buildings with white window frames are visible, along with a partially obscured street sign.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a man wearing sunglasses sitting in the back seat of a car, with his body visible from the shoulders up through the open car window. He is looking at the camera, with a blurred building and two people in the background.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up, a man is shown from the shoulders up, positioned in the bottom right of the frame. He is framed by the open rear window of a black car that extends from the foreground into the middle ground. Through the car window, two out-of-focus people are visible in the background, positioned to the left of the main subject. A residential building occupies the top portion of the frame in the background, with a street sign in the top right. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
