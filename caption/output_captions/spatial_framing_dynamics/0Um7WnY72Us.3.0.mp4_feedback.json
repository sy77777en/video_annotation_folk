    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot initially frames a man in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, viewed from the side as he looks toward a CRT monitor in the center-left middle ground. A computer tower is positioned on the far left, also in the middle ground. A bright, out-of-focus light source is present in the bottom-right foreground, partially obscuring the man. The man then turns his head and upper body toward the right side of the frame, reorienting himself to face more toward the front while remaining in his original position. The camera is static and positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit room, a shirtless, light-skinned man with dark, curly, short hair and facial stubble is seen mostly from the side and back. He is looking at an old, beige CRT computer monitor which displays a black-and-white medical scan, possibly of a brain or skull. Text on the screen includes \"SCAN 4 SLC 6\" and a highlighted box containing the words \"EXTRACTION SUCCESSFUL.\" The man then turns his head to the right side of the frame and his body turns to the front, beginning to laugh with his mouth wide open.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark room, a shirtless man with dark, curly hair leans toward a vintage CRT monitor next to a beige computer tower. The monochrome screen displays a medical-style scan of a skull. Overlaying the scan is text that reads \"SCAN 4 SLC 6\" and, within a highlighted box, \"EXTRACTION SUCCESSFUL\". As the man watches the screen, he begins to laugh, illuminated by both the screen and a light visible in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
