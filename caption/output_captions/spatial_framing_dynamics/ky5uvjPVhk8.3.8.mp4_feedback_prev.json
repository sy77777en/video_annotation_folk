    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing two people on a path in a Japanese garden. Initially, the man in the white jacket is positioned on the left side of the frame, kneeling in the foreground, while the woman in the yellow vest stands further down the path in the middle ground, slightly to the right. As the video progresses, the man stands up and moves towards the center of the frame, aligning with the woman, who remains in the middle ground. The path curves gently, guiding the viewer's eye through the scene, with vibrant foliage in the background. The camera maintains a consistent height at the subjects' level, emphasizing their interaction within the serene garden setting. The surrounding greenery and stone elements provide a textured backdrop, enhancing the spatial depth of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two people on a path surrounded by vibrant foliage. One is a man with dark hair, wearing a white jacket, dark pants, and black shoes, holding a phone, possibly taking photos or recording a video. The other is a woman in a white shirt with a brown plaid pattern, a long yellow vest, black shorts, and black knee-high boots, standing and facing the man. She has long brown hair and is positioned slightly further down the path. The interaction suggests a photo or video session.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, capturing a serene outdoor setting in a Japanese garden during autumn. The path is paved and gently curves through the scene, bordered by lush greenery and vibrant foliage. The trees display a mix of green, orange, and red leaves, indicating the seasonal transition. On the left, small shrubs with pink flowers line the path, while on the right, a stone wall slightly lower than a person adds texture and depth. Signs with Japanese characters are placed along the path, contributing to the cultural ambiance. Two individuals are present, one in a white jacket and another in a yellow long vest, taking photos or videos along the path. The atmosphere is calm, with the natural beauty of the garden highlighted by the colorful leaves and well-maintained landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
