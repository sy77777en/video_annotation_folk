    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the shot initially looks down at a bare foot in the bottom-center foreground. The camera then tilts up to reveal a carpeted staircase descending from the foreground into the background, occupying the center of the frame. Wooden banisters on the left and right sides frame the staircase, also receding into the background. A small, white-and-black object is positioned in the background at the bottom-center of the stairs. The entire scene is rendered with a wavy, distorting visual effect that ripples across the frame, while the camera remains at a high angle, positioned at the top of the stairs looking down.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, the video shows a person with fair skin looking down while walking. Their bare foot, with red-painted toenails, is visible at the bottom of the frame, along with the hem of their blue pants. Then, the subject walks toward a carpeted staircase with wooden banisters on either side. At the bottom of the stairs, a small, white-and-black object, possibly a stuffed animal or a small pet, is sitting. A wavy, distorting visual effect is applied to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a view from the top of a dimly lit, carpeted staircase inside a house. The camera initially focuses on bare feet with red-painted toenails before tilting up to reveal the descent, and then tilts down as the person descends. The stairs are covered in a neutral-toned carpet, flanked by wooden banisters with vertical spindles. The surrounding walls are a light green, with green noticeable along the edges. A prominent visual distortion creates a wavy, rippling effect across the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
