    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A military-style convoy is shown traveling down a long, straight, four-lane highway in a desert environment. The main focus of the convoy is a large semi-truck with a dark cab and a long, white, windowless trailer that has large white patterns on its side. This central truck is escorted by several identical green, armored military vehicles, which are positioned both in front of and behind it. These escort vehicles are square in shape and appear to have turrets or equipment mounted on their roofs. Following at the very rear of the convoy is a dark-colored SUV.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective of a convoy of vehicles traveling down a long, straight, two-way, four-lane highway that bisects a vast desert landscape. The arid environment is characterized by sandy, beige-colored terrain with sparse, low-lying vegetation. In the distance, low, rocky hills line the horizon under a bright, slightly hazy sky. The convoy, consisting of several olive-green armored vehicles and a large semi-truck with a white trailer, proceeds along the dark gray asphalt road, which is marked with yellow center lines.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide, high-angle aerial shot, a military convoy is positioned diagonally, moving from the bottom left foreground toward the top right background on a desert highway. The main semi-truck occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground. It is escorted by several armored vehicles: two are in the foreground at the bottom left, another is directly behind the truck in the middle ground, and a dark SUV follows at a distance in the background on the right. The camera tracks forward with the convoy, maintaining a side-on view while gradually descending from its high position to a lower angle, closer to the vehicles' level.",
