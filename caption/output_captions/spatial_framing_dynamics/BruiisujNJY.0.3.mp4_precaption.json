    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a natural landscape scenery, guiding the viewer on a slow journey through a dark and narrow rock passage, reminiscent of a cave or tight canyon. The environment is enveloped in near-total darkness, with a faint, warm, reddish-orange light initially emanating from an unseen source further down the path. As the video progresses, this light source becomes more prominent, originating from an entrance located in the center-right side of the frame in the final scene. The light gradually illuminates the rough, layered texture of the rock walls, enhancing the mysterious and foreboding atmosphere. The camera's slow, peeking movement emphasizes a sense of exploration and discovery within the dimly lit space, focusing on the environment's ambiance rather than any specific object or character.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, moves forward through a dark, narrow passage. The walls are composed of rough, layered rock, illuminated by a dim, reddish-orange light originating from an unseen source further down the path. The environment is almost entirely dark, with the light revealing the texture of the rock formations. Small, out-of-focus particles are visible in the foreground against the darkness. In the latter part of the video, the light source becomes more prominent, appearing to originate from an entrance located in the center-right side of the frame in the final scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot. The scene opens with a wide shot from a first-person perspective, looking into a dark rock passage. The frame is initially dominated by darkness, with out-of-focus silhouettes in the foreground on the left and right, and a faint reddish-orange light visible in the middle ground, slightly right of center. The camera moves slowly forward and to the left, as if peeking around a corner. This movement reveals more of the layered rock walls in the middle ground and causes the light source, an opening, to become more prominent, shifting to a center-right position in the frame. By the end, the illuminated opening is visible in the background, framed by the dark passage walls in the middle ground and a remaining dark silhouette in the right foreground. The camera's height remains level with the passage throughout the shot.",
