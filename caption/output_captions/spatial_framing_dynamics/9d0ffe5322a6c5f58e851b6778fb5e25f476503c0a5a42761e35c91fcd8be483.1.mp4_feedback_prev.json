    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures a cityscape at sunset, with the sky filling the upper two-thirds of the frame and the urban skyline situated along the bottom third. In the initial framing, a prominent white building is visible on the bottom left in the middle ground, while a silhouette of other buildings and dark trees stretches across the bottom of the frame. The camera then performs a slow pan to the right. As it moves, the white building shifts further to the left, and the central part of the cityscape moves towards the left side of the frame, revealing more of the expansive sky and the urban landscape on the right. The entire scene is captured from a high-angle perspective, looking out over the city.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing the urban skyline against a dramatic sunset. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the environment. The composition emphasizes the interplay between the natural beauty of the sky and the man-made structures below, creating a mood of tranquil beauty. The sky is filled with a vast expanse of clouds, painted in warm hues of gold, orange, and soft yellow by the setting sun, contrasting with darker, purplish-grey tones higher up. Below, a silhouette of city buildings and lush, dark green trees stretches across the horizon, with some structures catching the last glimmers of sunlight, creating a serene and picturesque urban vista.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high vantage point overlooking a city, the scene captures a dramatic sunset. The sky is filled with a vast expanse of scattered clouds, tinged with shades of golden yellow, orange, and grey from the setting sun. Below, a silhouette of the city skyline stretches across the horizon, featuring a mix of buildings and dark green trees, including some identifiable palm trees. A prominent white, multi-story building is visible on the left, while other structures are seen in the middle distance. The camera performs a slow pan to the right, offering a wider view of the colorful, cloud-filled sky and the urban landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
