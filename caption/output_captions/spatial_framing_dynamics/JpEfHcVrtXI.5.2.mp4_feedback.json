    "pre_caption": "In a static, wide, side-view shot, a large, dark purple creature and a small, white creature are positioned in the center-right of the frame, situated in the middle ground. The small, luminous creature floats just above the back of the larger one, which stands on a wooden fence. The scene is framed by large trees in the middle ground and background. The foreground and middle ground are covered in green grass and foliage, with a nest-like structure visible in the bottom-left. The camera remains stationary at a height level with the subjects, capturing the scene in profile.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, rotund, dark purple creature with a bear-like form carries a small, white, spirit-like creature on its back. The smaller creature is luminous, with a slender body, long, pointed ears, and thin limbs, giving it a delicate, ethereal appearance. The larger creature has a bulky, rounded physique and small, dark eyes, contrasting with the bright, glowing form of its passenger.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a lush, sun-dappled forest during the day. Large, thick-trunked trees with dense green foliage populate the environment, with hazy golden light filtering through the canopy. The ground is a vibrant green, covered in grass, moss, and small purple flowers. On the left, a small nest-like structure made of woven twigs rests on the ground. To the right, a large, dark purple creature stands on a rickety wooden fence, with a small, white, glowing creature floating just above it as particles of light drift through the air.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
