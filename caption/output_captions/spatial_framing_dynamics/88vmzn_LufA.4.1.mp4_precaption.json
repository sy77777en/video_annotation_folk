    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases a black Cadillac presidential limousine from multiple angles against a neutral gray background. The long, armored vehicle has a glossy black body and features the American flag on the front passenger-side fender and the blue Presidential Seal flag on the driver-side fender. A circular Presidential Seal emblem is also present on the rear passenger door. The car is equipped with large, multi-spoke silver wheels, a prominent front grille with the Cadillac crest, and two antennas on the rear of the roof. The view pans around the vehicle, revealing its full length and the design of its rear, which includes vertical taillights and another Cadillac crest on the trunk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a studio setting with a solid dark gray background, a long, black armored limousine is showcased. The glossy vehicle, a modern Cadillac design, features tinted windows, large silver multi-spoke wheels, and two flags mounted on the front fenders: the American flag and a blue presidential flag. A circular seal is also present on the rear passenger door. The perspective smoothly rotates around the car, starting from a front three-quarter view and moving to reveal its side and rear profiles. At the beginning of the video, overlay elements briefly appear, with white text on a blue background showing up in the center at the bottom of the screen, displaying 'CADILLAC \"THE BEAST\"'.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a full shot of a black Cadillac presidential limousine, positioned centrally within the frame against a neutral gray background. The camera is at the vehicle's level, capturing the limousine in the middle ground. Initially, the car is shown from a front three-quarter view, with the American flag on the front passenger-side fender and the blue Presidential Seal flag on the driver-side fender visible in the foreground. The camera smoothly pans around the vehicle, transitioning from the front to reveal the side and then the rear profile, maintaining the car's central position. The rear view highlights the vertical taillights and the Cadillac crest on the trunk. Overlay text briefly appears at the bottom center of the screen, displaying 'CADILLAC \"THE BEAST\"' in white on a blue background. The camera movement is consistent, providing a comprehensive view of the limousine's design and features.",
