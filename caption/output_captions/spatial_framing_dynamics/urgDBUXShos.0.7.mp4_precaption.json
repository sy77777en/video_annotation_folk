    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the video, a man with white face paint, dark circles around his eyes, and red paint extending from his mouth in a smile, is shown in profile facing right. He has greasy, medium-length dark hair with some lighter streaks and is wearing a dark purple suit jacket. He is very close to a woman who is in profile facing left. The woman has long hair pinned up, revealing part of her neck, and is wearing a dark green top. The man's dark-gloved fingers press against her cheek while he holds a small, metallic, blade-like object near her cheek and mouth.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, in a dimly lit, spacious area, possibly a ballroom or a large hall during an evening event. In the blurred background, indistinct figures of people can be seen, suggesting a gathering. On the right side, there appears to be a cabinet in the scene, indicating that the main characters are positioned in a corner of the room. A prominent, textured, light-colored pillar or wall section is visible on the left. The overall lighting is subdued, creating a dark ambiance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot. A man is positioned in the left foreground, shown in profile facing right. A woman is in the right foreground, in profile facing left. The man's dark-gloved hand is in the center foreground, pressing against the woman's right cheek, while a small, metallic, blade-like object is also in the center foreground, held near her cheek and mouth. In the left background, a light-colored pillar or wall section is visible. Indistinct figures of people are in the background, and a cabinet is suggested in the right background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
