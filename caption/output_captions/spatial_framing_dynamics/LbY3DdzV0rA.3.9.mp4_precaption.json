    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This dramatic landscape scenery shot captures a powerful thunderstorm under a starry night sky, with a focus on the striking bolts of lightning that intermittently illuminate the scene. The composition emphasizes the scale and atmosphere of the natural phenomenon, with a vast, dark storm cloud dominating the frame. Brilliant flashes of white and purple lightning light up the cloud from within, while powerful bolts strike down towards the ground on the right, enhancing the dramatic impact. In the distance on the left, the dark silhouette of a mountain range is visible, with the warm, scattered lights of a distant town or highway glowing at its base.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A nighttime view captures a vast, dark landscape under a star-filled sky. A massive, dark storm cloud occupies the center of the frame. Powerful flashes of lightning intermittently illuminate the cloud from within, revealing its billowing structure in shades of white and purple. Bright bolts of lightning also strike down from the cloud towards the dark horizon on the right. In the far distance to the left, the silhouette of a mountain range is visible above a string of bright lights on the ground.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a nighttime landscape from a fixed, low-angle perspective. A starry sky occupies the top portion of the frame in the background. A large storm cloud dominates the center and right of the frame in the middle ground. In the bottom left background, the silhouette of a mountain range is visible, with a line of lights at its base along the horizon. The scene is dynamically altered by intermittent flashes of lightning that illuminate the central cloud from within and by bolts that strike down from the cloud on the right side of the frame, connecting the middle ground to the background.",
