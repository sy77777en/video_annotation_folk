    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark-skinned hand, extending from the cuff of a white, long-sleeved shirt, first uses a black smartphone. The phone's screen displays a calculator application featuring white numerals on dark gray circular buttons and orange circular operational buttons, with the calculated result shown on its display changing. The hand then places the phone onto large white architectural blueprints and picks up a light brown wooden pencil. Using the pencil, the hand proceeds to write or make notations on the blueprints, which are detailed with black and gray technical drawings, dimensions, and feature the visible text \"Structures Education,\" all spread across a light-colored wooden table. A portion of a white rolled-up paper or blueprint tube with a black end is also visible in the lower right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an overhead perspective, a large architectural blueprint with black-lined diagrams and measurements is spread across a light-colored wooden desk. A person wearing a white shirt uses a calculator app on a black smartphone that is resting on the paper. After performing a calculation, they pick up a nearby wooden pencil and point to a section of the drawing. A rolled-up white paper is also visible on the desk.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a medium to close-up shot of a hand using a phone's calculator, then picking up a pencil and writing on a table covered with large blueprints.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a medium to close-up, high-angle shot. Initially, a hand is positioned in the bottom-left foreground, operating a smartphone's calculator. The large architectural blueprints, which serve as the middle ground, are spread across the entire frame. A wooden pencil rests in the middle-left, and a rolled-up paper is in the bottom-right foreground. The hand then places the phone down in the bottom-left quadrant and moves to the middle-left to pick up the pencil. Finally, the hand, holding the pencil, moves across the center-left area of the blueprints, pointing to different parts of the drawing. The person's torso remains partially visible at the top-left edge throughout the shot.",
