    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a camera tracking a floating long-sleeve shirt with a red base color and white polka dots, moving to the right. As the camera continues, it reveals a small, rectangular suitcase with a hard shell and a handle. Once the suitcase is centered in the frame, the camera remains still, showing the suitcase open to reveal its contents. Inside, the shirt is neatly folded and positioned on the right side of the suitcase. Beside it, several rolled-up pieces of clothing in light colors, such as white and gray, are arranged. The suitcase and its contents are viewed from above, with the shirt\u2019s collar and buttons clearly visible, making it the most visually prominent item among the packed clothing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors on a pale, whitewashed wooden floor with visible horizontal planks and subtle weathered texture. A soft, fabric-textured suitcase in muted gray rests on the floor, its rectangular shape and rounded corners clearly defined. Initially, a neatly folded, long-sleeved shirt in a faded red color with white polka dots is outside the suitcase and gradually floats into it. Several rolled-up items in light gray and white tones are arranged beside the shirt. The lighting is even and cool, suggesting daytime with no direct sunlight or shadows except for a soft shadow cast by the suitcase. The scene tracks the floating shirt to the right, focusing on the suitcase and its contents within the simple, uncluttered setting after the suitcase is shown in the center of the frame. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot from above, showing a long-sleeve shirt with a red base and white polka dots floating horizontally from the center toward the right side of the frame, positioned in the middle ground above a pale, whitewashed wooden floor. As the camera tracks the shirt\u2019s movement to the right, a small, rectangular suitcase with a hard shell and handle enters the frame from the right edge, occupying the bottom right and middle ground. The camera continues to follow the shirt until the suitcase is centered in the frame, then becomes stationary. In the next shot, the suitcase is fully open and viewed directly from above, filling most of the frame and positioned in the center foreground. Inside, the shirt is now neatly folded and placed on the right side of the suitcase, occupying the bottom right and foreground, while several rolled-up pieces of light-colored clothing are arranged beside it on the left, also in the foreground. The camera remains at a high angle above the subjects throughout, with no change in camera height. The spatial dynamic shifts from a moving shot that tracks the shirt and suitcase to a static overhead view that clearly displays the arrangement of the packed items.",
