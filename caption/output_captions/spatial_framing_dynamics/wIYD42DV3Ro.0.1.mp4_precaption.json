    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a horse race on a dirt track with multiple horses and jockeys in motion. The jockeys wear colorful racing silks, including blue, white, and red, and are positioned on the horses, guiding them around a bend. The horses are of various shades of brown and are galloping closely together. The scene is set in a large stadium filled with spectators, visible in the background, with a multi-tiered grandstand and a distinctive spire-topped building. The track is bordered by a white railing, separating the racing area from the grassy infield. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, capturing the intensity and excitement of the race.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a horse racing event from a broadcast POV shot set up for television production. The setting is outdoors at a racetrack, which encircles a well-maintained grassy area. The time of day is overcast, with diffused daylight illuminating the scene. The grandstand, a multi-tiered structure, features two central spires, with the left and right sections extending beyond their height, adding architectural interest. Spectators fill the grandstand on one side, while tents are situated on the grassy area. The racetrack is a dirt path, and the horses, ridden by jockeys in colorful attire, are in motion, kicking up dust as they race. An additional building is positioned across from the stands, becoming visible only after the horses round a corner, suggesting a bustling event atmosphere. Overlay elements include a network logo in the top right corner, indicating the broadcast nature of the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot, capturing the entire racetrack, the grandstand filled with spectators, and the horses and jockeys in the foreground. The horses and jockeys are initially positioned near the bottom center of the frame, moving from the left towards the right. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a wide shot, focusing more closely on the horses and jockeys as they race along the track. The horses and jockeys move from the left side of the frame towards the right, occupying the center and right portions of the frame. The grandstand remains in the background, spanning the top left to the top right of the frame. The white railing bordering the track is consistently visible in the middle ground, separating the track from the grassy infield. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subjects, keeping the horses and jockeys in clear view as they race. The transition from extreme wide to wide shot enhances the focus on the horses and jockeys while still providing context of the surrounding environment.",
