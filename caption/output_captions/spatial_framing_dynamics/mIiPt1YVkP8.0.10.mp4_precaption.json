    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Four light-gray passenger airplanes are lined up on a dark runway at night, which is illuminated by runway edge lights. Each airplane has a glowing white text label above it, identifying its flight number. From left to right, the first airplane is a narrow-body jet labeled \"UAL 1118.\" The second is a larger, wide-body jet labeled \"UAL 863.\" The third is a narrow-body jet labeled \"PAL 115,\" and the fourth is another narrow-body jet labeled \"UAL 1.\" All four planes are positioned along a yellow dashed line on the tarmac, with the fourth airplane slightly angled more to the right compared to the others.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At an airport at night, four gray airplanes are lined up on a dark runway marked with yellow and white lines. The scene is illuminated by a series of bright, white runway lights along the edge of the tarmac, casting a glow on the aircraft. Above each plane, glowing white text displays its flight number: \"UAL 1118,\" \"UAL 863,\" \"PAL 115,\" and \"UAL 1.\" The camera arcs clockwise and zooms out, revealing each successive plane in the queue against a completely black sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot begins with two airplanes, \"UAL 1118\" on the left and \"UAL 863\" on the right, positioned in the middle ground on a runway. The camera, positioned at a low angle, arcs clockwise while simultaneously zooming out. This movement reveals two additional airplanes, \"PAL 115\" and \"UAL 1,\" appearing sequentially to the right of the initial two. The final composition shows all four airplanes lined up from left to right across the middle ground, with a row of runway lights extending from the bottom right foreground toward the center of the scene.",
