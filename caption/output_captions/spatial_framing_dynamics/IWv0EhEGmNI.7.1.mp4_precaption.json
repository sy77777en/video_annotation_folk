    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is shown from the first-person perspective of a video game character in a dark environment. The character is holding a rifle, which is visible at the bottom of the screen along with a heads-up display showing the ammunition count. The view is from inside a building, looking out through a doorway into a dark, outdoor area at night. In the distance, the rear of a light-colored car is visible under an archway. Red text appears at the bottom of the screen, displaying dialogue from a character identified as \"Al-Qatala Fighter 2.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, looks from a dark interior through an open doorway into a dimly lit outdoor area at night. The view, which slowly zooms in, is framed by the dark doorway and focuses on the rear of a light-colored car parked under an archway. To the left of the arch, a brick wall and a planter with foliage are visible. A heads-up display (HUD) is present as an overlay in the bottom right, showing a weapon icon and ammunition count. A small white reticle is in the center of the screen, and later, a \"Mount\" prompt and red subtitle text appear as overlays at the bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the scene is initially framed by a dark doorway on the left, looking out into a dimly lit outdoor area in the middle ground. A heads-up display is positioned in the bottom right as a foreground overlay. The camera slowly pushes forward and pans slightly to the right while zooming in, gradually revealing more of the scene. This movement centers on an archway in the middle ground, under which the rear of a light-colored car is visible in the background. To the left of the arch, a brick wall and a planter appear in the middle ground. During this movement, a \"Mount\" prompt and red subtitle text appear as overlays at the bottom of the frame.",
