    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a lioness with a tawny coat, lying down with her front paws extended. Her fur is smooth and light brown, with a slightly lighter underbelly and a chin that is even lighter in color. She has a focused gaze, with bright amber eyes accentuated by a ring of black lining them, and a small portion of her tongue visible. Her ears are perked up, and her facial features are defined, with a prominent nose and whiskers. The lioness is positioned in a relaxed manner, suggesting a calm demeanor.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting in a natural environment, featuring a lioness resting on the ground. The background consists of large, dark tree trunks, providing a contrasting backdrop to the lioness's tawny fur. The scene is well-lit, suggesting daytime, with the sunlight highlighting the textures and colors of the lioness's coat. The lioness is positioned prominently in the foreground, lying down with a relaxed posture. The ground beneath her is earthy, contributing to the calm and serene atmosphere, with no visible movement or changes in the environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static medium shot, a lioness is positioned in the center-right of the frame and occupies the foreground. Behind her, in the background, the dark, textured trunks of a large tree fill the left side and top of the frame. The camera remains stationary at the lioness's eye level, and there are no changes to the spatial composition of the scene.",
