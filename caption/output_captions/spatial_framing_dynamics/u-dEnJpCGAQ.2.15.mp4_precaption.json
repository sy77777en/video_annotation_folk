    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a lioness with a tawny coat, lying down with her front paws extended. Her fur is smooth and light brown, with a slightly lighter underbelly and a chin that is even lighter in color. She has a focused gaze, with bright amber eyes accentuated by a ring of black lining them, and a small portion of her tongue visible. Her ears are perked up, and her facial features are defined, with a prominent nose and whiskers. The lioness is positioned in a relaxed manner, suggesting a calm demeanor.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting in a natural environment, featuring a lioness resting on the ground. The background consists of large, dark tree trunks, providing a contrasting backdrop to the lioness's tawny fur. The scene is well-lit, suggesting daytime, with the sunlight highlighting the textures and colors of the lioness's coat. The lioness is positioned prominently in the foreground, lying down with a relaxed posture. The ground beneath her is earthy, contributing to the calm and serene atmosphere, with no visible movement or changes in the environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a lioness, capturing her from the side with her full body visible. The lioness occupies the central area of the frame, lying down with her front paws extended forward. In 2D positioning, she is situated towards the center-right of the frame, while in 3D, she is in the foreground, clearly the main focus. Behind her, large, dark tree trunks form the background, positioned to the left and behind her in 2D and in the middle ground in 3D. The camera remains steady throughout, maintaining a consistent medium shot without any noticeable changes in shot size or position. The camera is positioned at the lioness's level, offering a direct view of her relaxed posture and surroundings. There are no significant movements or transitions within the frame.",
