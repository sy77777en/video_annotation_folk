    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of a person from behind, positioned on the right side of the frame in the middle ground. In the center of the frame, a large computer monitor is displayed, while a red audio interface sits in the bottom-left foreground, and a keyboard with a prosthetic hand on it is in the bottom-center foreground. The camera then pans slightly down and to the left before the scene cuts to a full, high-angle shot looking down into a cardboard box that fills the center of the frame. Inside the box, various computer components are visible in the middle ground, and a person's foot briefly enters the top-right foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with short, light-colored hair is shown from behind, sitting at a wooden desk and using a computer. They are wearing a light-colored shirt and have a white, robotic-looking prosthetic left hand, which rests on the keyboard. On the computer monitor, a website named \"TECHGALE\" displays an order for computer components, including a \"Network Interface Card\" for \"US $45,\" with a \"Complete Order\" button at the bottom. To the left of the keyboard sits a small, rectangular, red audio interface with black knobs. The scene then transitions to a view looking down into a brown cardboard box on the floor, which contains several computer parts. Prominently visible are a small, silver computer case with an orange front and a large, finned heat sink on top, alongside at least two other circuit boards. A person's foot, wearing a grey shoe and blue jeans, is briefly seen next to the box.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit room with a purple hue, a person with a prosthetic hand sits at a wooden desk. On the desk are a keyboard, a red audio interface, and a large computer monitor. An overlay on the screen displays a website titled \"TECHGALE,\" showing an order for computer components with a \"Complete Order\" button. The scene then shifts to a view inside an open cardboard box on the floor, which contains several computer parts, including two circuit boards and a silver, finned case with orange sides.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and above the subject when the second subject is in focus.",
