    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A White-crowned Lapwing, a type of wader bird, stands and walks in a muddy area with shallow puddles. The bird has a grey head and neck, with a distinct white patch on its crown. Its beak is bright yellow, and it has a prominent yellow wattle at the base of the beak. The bird's back and upper wings are brownish-grey, with a visible black band on the folded wing, bordered by white. Its underparts are white. It has long, slender, pale-colored legs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a muddy, outdoor environment under daylight. The ground is composed of thick, brown mud with uneven surfaces and small puddles of murky, light-brown water. The mud appears wet and clumpy. A bird with a grey back, white underbelly, black wing markings, a grey head, and a prominent yellow wattle and beak walks through the mud.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a White-crowned Lapwing, initially positioned in the center-left of the frame, within the middle ground. The bird is surrounded by thick, brown mud that fills the foreground, middle ground, and background, with a prominent puddle of murky water occupying the center-right middle ground. As the video progresses, the bird walks from the center-left towards the center-right of the frame, maintaining its full shot framing and middle ground position. The camera remains positioned above the subject throughout the scene.",
