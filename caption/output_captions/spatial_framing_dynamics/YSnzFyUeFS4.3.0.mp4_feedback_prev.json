    "pre_caption": "This wide, first-person POV shot begins from behind a group of pedestrians in the foreground as they start to cross a city street from the bottom of the frame. Initially, a man in a patterned shirt is in the center-left foreground. As the camera moves forward across the crosswalk, the foreground pedestrians walk toward the left and exit the frame. This movement reveals more of the middle ground, where other pedestrians and a cyclist travel from right to left across the intersection. The camera continues forward, opening up the view to show a police car in the left middle ground, while tall buildings and green trees form the background across the entire frame. The camera is positioned at approximately eye-level, creating an immersive perspective of walking through the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of pedestrians crosses a city street at a crosswalk. The group includes several men and women dressed in casual summer attire. A man in the foreground wears a black and white patterned short-sleeved shirt with blue jeans, while another man next to him is in a black collared shirt and light-colored pants. A man in a black t-shirt, yellow shorts, and a baseball cap walks across the street. A cyclist on a black bicycle rides through the intersection. In the background, vehicles, including a white police car with its lights on, a yellow taxi, and a black SUV, are stopped or moving through the intersection. Other people can be seen walking on the sidewalks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures the experience of walking across a wide city street at an intersection. The scene is set with the low sun casting long shadows and bathing the urban landscape in a warm, golden light against a clear blue sky. Pedestrians and a cyclist move across the white-striped crosswalk on the dark asphalt. The intersection is surrounded by multi-story buildings, including red-brick structures and taller, light-colored high-rises, with a water tower visible in the distance. Large, leafy green trees line one side of the street. In the background, a yellow taxi and a police vehicle are parked on the side of the road along the perpendicular street.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
