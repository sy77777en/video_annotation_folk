    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases the animated transformation of an architectural structure into an abstract form. It begins with a blue pen sketch on a white background, depicting two block-like building sections connected by an arch. The left section features a starburst pattern, suggesting an explosion or impact, with rectangular windows, while the right section has a grid of similar windows. As the animation progresses, the structure morphs into a more organic, multi-legged form. The initial building elements evolve into curved, tapering leg-like supports, and a large, wavy canopy develops over the central area, with other parts extending into pointed or tentacle-like appendages. The drawing style is loose and sketchy, with visible construction lines and hatching for shading and form.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from an objective, observational perspective, showcases a blue pen sketch on a white background. Initially, it depicts two connected, somewhat angular building-like forms, with lines radiating from the facade of the left structure and an archway joining it to the right. This sketched edifice then undergoes a fluid transformation: the left section deconstructs as the entire entity morphs into a lower, wider organic shape. This new form is supported by multiple tapering, leg-like pillars and is covered by a broad, undulating, shaded canopy, with the sketchy lines animating to illustrate this continuous metamorphosis.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a blue pen sketch, initially depicting two building-like forms connected by an arch, all centrally located in the middle ground against a white background. The left form, featuring a starburst pattern, and the right form are positioned to the left and right of the center, respectively, with the arch connecting them in the upper-middle part of the frame. During the animation, this entire sketched entity remains in the central middle ground while it morphs: the left section deconstructs as the structure lowers and widens, evolving into an organic shape. This new form features multiple tapering, leg-like supports emerging at the bottom center and a broad, undulating canopy developing across the upper-central area, with some elements extending towards the right. The camera maintains a consistent, objective viewpoint, appearing slightly elevated or at eye-level to the 2D sketch.",
