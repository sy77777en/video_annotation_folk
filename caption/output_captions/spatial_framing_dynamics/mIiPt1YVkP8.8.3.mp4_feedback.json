    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot, filmed from above, frames an aircraft's flight management computer, which occupies the center-right of the frame in the foreground. A hand enters from the bottom left, its fingers moving across the keyboard located in the lower portion of the unit. The rectangular screen, positioned in the upper center of the console, is initially black. As the hand interacts with the keys, the screen illuminates to display green text, which then changes to show a list of arrival and approach data. A small white knob is visible on the right side of the unit, below the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person's light-skinned hand operates the keyboard of an aircraft's Flight Management Computer. The beige-colored control unit features a small, rectangular screen above an alphanumeric keyboard with various function buttons. Initially, the screen displays green text, but as the hand presses a button, it turns black and subsequently illuminates again with different text, showing arrival and approach information for \"KLAX,\" including a list of STARs like \"BASE13\" and \"BUFIE1\" and ILS approaches such as \"ILS06L\" and \"ILS07R.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Inside a dimly lit aircraft cockpit, the close-up shot focuses on a flight management computer console. The beige metallic unit features a physical keypad with black buttons and a small, white control knob. A hand interacts with the keypad, causing the initially black screen to illuminate with glowing green text. The display is titled \"KLAX ARRIVALS\" and shows a list of items referred to as STARS alongside APPROACHES.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
