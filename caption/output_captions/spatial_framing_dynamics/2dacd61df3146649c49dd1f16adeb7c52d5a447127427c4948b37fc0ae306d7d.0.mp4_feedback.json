    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an abandoned hallway, capturing the full length and breadth of the corridor. The camera remains at a consistent height, roughly at eye level, providing a clear view of the entire scene. The graffiti-covered walls occupy the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background. On the right side, large windows line the wall, positioned in the middle ground and background, allowing natural light to enter. The floor, marked with cracks and debris, spans the bottom of the frame from the foreground to the background. A pile of rubble is visible in the middle ground on the left side. The ceiling, showing signs of wear, is situated at the top of the frame, running continuously from the foreground to the background. As the camera moves forward, the perspective shifts slightly, maintaining the same shot size while bringing different sections of the hallway into clearer view. The initial and final states of the shot remain consistent in terms of framing, with the camera steadily advancing through the corridor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is an interior scenery shot of an abandoned hallway. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific object. The hallway is long and narrow, with walls covered in colorful graffiti, adding a sense of urban decay. The ceiling and floor show signs of wear, with debris scattered throughout. Large windows line one side, allowing natural light to filter in, highlighting the dilapidated state. The overall mood is one of neglect and abandonment, emphasizing the scale and emptiness of the space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a long, narrow corridor in an abandoned building, characterized by its deteriorating condition and graffiti-covered walls. The setting is indoors, with large windows on one side allowing natural light to filter in, casting a muted glow over the scene. The walls are adorned with colorful graffiti, featuring various shapes and markings, adding a chaotic yet vibrant element to the otherwise decaying environment. The floor is cracked and littered with debris, leading to a pile of rubble located midway down the corridor. The ceiling shows signs of wear, with peeling paint and exposed materials. The overall atmosphere is one of neglect and abandonment, with the corridor stretching into the distance, emphasizing the building's desolate state.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
