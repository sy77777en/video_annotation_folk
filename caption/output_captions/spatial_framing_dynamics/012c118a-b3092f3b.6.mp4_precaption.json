    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere of a nighttime urban street, rather than a specific object. The shot captures the ambient lighting, street layout, and movement of vehicles, offering an immersive experience likely intended to convey the feel of driving through the city at night.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a dashcam mounted on a vehicle, shows a nighttime urban street scene. The road is lined with parked cars on both sides, and buildings with exterior lights are visible along the street. Streetlights cast a dim glow. The vehicle moves smoothly along the road, with only one car passing in the distance. The overall atmosphere is calm, with the focus on the road ahead and the surrounding cityscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a nighttime urban street scene, capturing the full breadth of the road and its surroundings. The camera remains stationary relative to the vehicle, providing a consistent view throughout. In the initial state, the road stretches into the distance, with parked cars lining both sides. These cars occupy the left and right edges of the frame, positioned in the foreground and middle ground. Buildings with exterior lights are visible along the street, situated in the middle ground and background, flanking the road on either side. Streetlights illuminate the scene, casting light across the road and sidewalks. As the video progresses, the vehicle advances along the road, bringing the initially distant traffic closer. A single car passes in the distance, moving from the left side of the frame towards the center. This car transitions from the background to the middle ground as it approaches. The camera maintains a height level with the vehicle's dashboard, offering a driver's perspective. The overall spatial composition remains largely unchanged, with the primary dynamic being the forward motion of the vehicle and the gradual approach of the passing car.",
