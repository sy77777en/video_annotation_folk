    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit scene viewed from a high angle, a dark-skinned man in a bright yellow hoodie is crouched and looking up toward the camera. The hood is pulled over his head, and he is exhaling a plume of smoke or vapor while wearing a gold watch on his right wrist. To his right, a person with long, dark hair and wearing dark clothing is kneeling on a patterned rug with one arm extended.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, objective viewpoint, the scene unfolds in a dimly lit room at night. The floor is almost entirely covered by a large, ornate rug featuring a complex pattern in shades of red, gold, and dark blue. The space is shrouded in deep shadows, with a focused spotlight illuminating the central area. Within this circle of light, a person in a bright yellow hooded sweatshirt crouches, exhaling a plume of white smoke. Another individual is likely kneeling on the floor, mostly obscured by the darkness. A red circular object and a black case also rest on the patterned surface of the rug.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera starts with an upside-down view of the subject, transitioning to a bird's-eye perspective above them.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with an upside-down full shot, positioning a man in a yellow hoodie in the top left foreground and a second person in dark clothing in the bottom right foreground, both on a patterned rug that fills the middle ground. The camera then rotates 180 degrees, settling into a bird's-eye view from directly above the subjects. In this final framing, the man in the hoodie is now located in the bottom left, looking up toward the camera, while the other individual is in the top right of the frame.",
