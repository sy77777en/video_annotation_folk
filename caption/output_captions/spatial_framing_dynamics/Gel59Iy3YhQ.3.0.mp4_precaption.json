    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a hand holding a yellow walkie-talkie with a black antenna and buttons, partially visible in the bottom center-left. The hand appears to be of a person with medium skin. The background consists of a rocky landscape with scattered trees and a cloudy sky, suggesting an outdoor setting. The hand remains in a similar position throughout.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, looks out onto a stylized, rocky landscape under a pale, greenish-yellow sky. A dirt path meanders forward between large, angular brown rocks and scattered green pine trees. In the lower-center-left of the view, a hand is visible holding a bright yellow walkie-talkie. Thin black wires stretch across the sky from a wooden pole on the left, which eventually goes out of frame from the left, and the terrain is dotted with small bushes and patches of dry grass.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a static, first-person perspective, a hand holding a walkie-talkie is positioned in the bottom-left foreground. A dirt path originates in the bottom-center foreground and extends into the middle ground. The path is flanked by large, angular rocks, with a significant formation occupying the right side of the frame from the foreground to the middle ground. A wooden pole stands on the far left in the middle ground, from which power lines stretch across the top of the frame toward the right. Green trees and bushes are scattered throughout the middle ground, with the sky visible in the background at the top of the frame. The camera remains stationary at an eye-level height throughout the shot.",
