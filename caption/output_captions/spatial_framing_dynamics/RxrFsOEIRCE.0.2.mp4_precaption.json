    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a fast-paced, low-altitude landscape scenery shot from an aerial perspective, likely captured by an FPV drone. The camera speeds across vast, flat farmland covered in vibrant green crops, with parallel dirt tracks creating strong leading lines that stretch towards a treeline in the distance. Above, a brilliant blue sky is dotted with fluffy white clouds. The focus of the video is on the immersive experience of flight and the expansive scale of the rural environment, rather than on a specific subject. The rapid movement creates a dynamic sense of speed, making the landscape itself the central element. A small, dark, cross-shaped shadow of the drone can be seen skimming across the ground, reinforcing the first-person perspective of the flight.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a low, high-speed flight over a vast, green field under a blue sky with white clouds. The drone follows a pair of parallel, brown tracks that run through the field toward a gentle slope in the distance, covered with green trees. A small, dark, cross-shaped shadow of the drone is present in the lower center of the view. The rapid forward motion creates a blur effect on the surrounding landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a low-altitude, forward-moving perspective. The frame is dominated by a vast green field in the foreground and middle ground, which fills the lower two-thirds of the view. Two parallel dirt tracks begin at the bottom center and extend into the middle ground, creating strong leading lines. A small, dark shadow of the drone is consistently positioned in the bottom center foreground, skimming over the crops. In the middle ground, a tree-lined hill extends from the top left towards the center. The background is composed of a blue sky with white clouds, occupying the top third of the frame. The camera moves rapidly forward at a very low height, causing the foreground and middle ground elements to rush past and blur, while the drone's shadow remains fixed in the bottom center, reinforcing the first-person flight perspective.",
