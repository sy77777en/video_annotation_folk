    "pre_caption": "The video features a skier captured in a full shot, positioned centrally within the frame. The skier is in the foreground, with snow-covered trees forming the background. The camera, held at the skier's level using a selfie stick, maintains a consistent angle as the skier moves dynamically through the scene. The skier's movement causes snow to spray, partially obscuring the view and adding a sense of motion. The trees, positioned in the background, frame the scene on both sides, enhancing the depth and creating a tunnel-like effect as the skier navigates through the snowy landscape. The camera remains steady, focusing on the skier's swift maneuvers and the surrounding environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person skiing through deep snow in a forested area. The skier is wearing a light gray helmet and goggles, a blue jacket, and dark pants. They are captured from a selfie angle, likely using a selfie stick, as they navigate through snow-covered trees. The skier is holding the selfie stick with their right hand while extending their left hand, seemingly to maintain balance. They are moving at a high speed, creating a spray of snow around them, which partially obscures the view. The scene conveys a sense of dynamic movement and skillful maneuvering through the snowy landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a dynamic scene in a snowy, forested landscape during the day. It is shot from a selfie POV, with the camera facing the person holding it, who is skiing through deep, powdery snow. Tall evergreen trees, covered with a thick layer of snow, frame the scene, creating a dense, wintry backdrop. The skier, dressed in blue and wearing goggles, moves swiftly, causing snow to spray up around them, adding a sense of motion and energy. The overcast sky casts a soft, diffused light over the scene, enhancing the whiteness of the snow and the dark green of the trees. The overall atmosphere is one of exhilarating movement through a pristine, snow-covered forest.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
