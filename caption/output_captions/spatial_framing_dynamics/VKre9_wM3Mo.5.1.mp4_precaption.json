    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A stylized, translucent human figure with a red cross symbol on its upper back is on its hands and knees on a reflective dark floor. The figure is positioned in front of a translucent, frosted white cubicle that resembles a restroom stall, with its head lowered as if peeking underneath the door. The cubicle is elevated on small legs, and through the gap at the bottom, the translucent foot of another figure is visible inside. The lower left corner of the video is obscured by the text \"[10]\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, undefined space with a reflective black floor, a translucent, frosted cubicle stands in the center. The rectangular structure is open at the top and elevated on four legs, with a visible door and handle. In front of the cubicle, a translucent, human-like figure is on the floor in a kneeling position with its head down. A red cross symbol is overlaid on the figure's upper back.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: A wide shot captures a human figure wearing a red cross symbol on their back, kneeling on the floor and peeking into a white cubicle resembling a toilet, where someone's foot is visible inside. The scene is set against a dark background.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A wide shot frames the scene. In the foreground and to the bottom left, a translucent human figure with a red cross kneels on a reflective floor. Positioned in the middle ground and center-right is a translucent, frosted white cubicle. Through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, another figure's foot is visible in the middle ground. The entire scene is set against a dark, undefined background. The camera is positioned at the level of the kneeling figure.",
