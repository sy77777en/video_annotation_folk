    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of the subjects, capturing the upper bodies and some lower body parts of the gymnasts and surrounding individuals. The gymnasts, positioned in the foreground and center of the frame, are actively engaging with each other through high-fives and clapping. They occupy the central area, with two prominently in the middle and others slightly to the left and right. In the background, individuals in black athletic wear are also visible, participating in the celebration with raised hands, situated towards the left side of the frame. The gymnastics equipment, such as the uneven bars, is located in the middle ground, slightly behind the gymnasts, while the banner and seating areas are in the far background. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective that emphasizes the interactions among the gymnasts and the celebratory atmosphere. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of female gymnasts with light complexions and light brown hair celebrating near gymnastics equipment. They are wearing matching red leotards with sheer black sleeves and rhinestone embellishments. Their hair is styled in buns, and one gymnast has a red bow. The women are engaged in a joyful interaction, clapping and high-fiving each other. Several women in black athletic wear, possibly coaches or team members, are also visible, joining in the celebration with raised hands. The setting appears to be an indoor sports venue, indicated by the presence of gymnastic apparatus and a banner in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a gymnasium, featuring a gymnastics event. The setting includes gymnastic equipment like uneven bars, with a blue mat covering the floor. The environment is lively, with participants wearing red leotards adorned with sparkles, indicating a competitive or celebratory atmosphere. The gymnasium has high ceilings and visible seating areas, suggesting a space designed for sports events. The lighting is bright, typical of indoor sports venues, and the overall scene conveys a sense of activity and movement, with individuals interacting energetically around the equipment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
