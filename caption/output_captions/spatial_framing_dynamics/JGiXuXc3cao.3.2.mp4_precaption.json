    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This animated video features three light-skinned men standing together. The man on the left, who appears older, has white hair and is dressed in a light gray suit with a red tie and a white shirt, with his hands in his pockets. In the center, another older man with a wrinkled face and thinning gray hair stands with his arms crossed, wearing a mustard-yellow polo shirt. To the right, a younger man with brown hair and glasses wears a white short-sleeved polo shirt and gray pants, holding his hands clasped in front of him. All three men are facing each other as if in conversation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor, animated scene is set by a calm, blue-green body of water. In the background, a large, out-of-focus vessel with a prominent mast is moored under a hazy, light blue sky with soft clouds. The overall visual style is that of a hand-drawn illustration.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium-wide shot frames three men from the waist up, positioned centrally in the foreground. The man in the suit stands on the left, the man in the yellow shirt is in the center, and the man with glasses is on the right. Behind them, a body of water occupies the middle ground. A large, out-of-focus vessel is visible in the background on the left, under a sky that fills the top of the frame. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' eye level.",
