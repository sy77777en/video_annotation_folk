    "pre_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective in a continuous wide shot, capturing a stylized desert environment. Initially, a massive canyon wall occupies the entire left side of the frame. A sandy path with a dark green cable runs from the bottom center foreground into the middle ground. On the right, rock formations and a body of water are situated in the middle ground and background. A building is first seen in the background, to the right of the center. The camera moves forward at a steady pace, following the path. This movement brings the building from the background into the middle ground, making it the central focus of the scene. The canyon wall remains a constant element on the left, while the rock formations and water on the right shift in perspective as the camera advances. The camera's height is consistently at eye level, simulating a character's view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a first-person perspective moving through a stylized desert canyon. The environment is composed of large, smooth, orange-brown rock formations, some of which rise as blocky pillars from a body of still, blue water on the right. A sandy path, marked by a continuous dark green cable, runs along the base of a massive canyon wall on the left. Scattered throughout the scene are small, bright green, low-poly bushes. As the perspective advances, a building becomes the central focus. It is a wooden structure with a reddish-brown roof, exposed beams, and partially open walls, situated on a rocky outcrop. A small, square window with a blue frame is visible on one of its orange-colored walls.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, follows a dark cable along a narrow, sandy path within a stylized desert canyon. On the left, a sheer orange rock wall rises, while on the right, jagged rock formations border a calm body of blue water that reflects the scenery. The path, dotted with small, bright green bushes, leads toward a partially constructed building with a wooden frame and a red roof, all set under a clear blue sky.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a first-person perspective of a game character walking through a stylized desert-like environment in a game. It maintains a wide shot to capture the surrounding terrain, including rock formations, vegetation, and finally a house. The camera moves forward along a narrow path beside a body of water, with the environment unfolding naturally as the character progresses.",
