    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot of an indoor, tiled space resembling a swimming pool area. Viewed from a high, downward-facing angle, a large, bright red water slide with a wide, curved opening occupies the center of the frame, set against walls and a floor covered in small, pale green tiles. The scene is illuminated by a single overhead light, casting a slightly eerie, yellowish-green glow and creating reflections on the wet-looking surfaces. The video lacks a main subject as the focus is on the unsettling and liminal atmosphere of the environment. The unusual top-down perspective and distorted geometry make the space itself the primary point of interest rather than any single object within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A shot moves through an indoor, tiled area. The walls and floor are covered in small, greenish-white square tiles, and a metal handrail is visible on the left next to a set of steps. The scene is illuminated by a round light on the ceiling. Positioned in the center is the wide, open entrance of a large, solid red water slide, which funnels into an enclosed tube. The perspective advances directly toward and into the mouth of the slide.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot captured from a high-angle, top-down perspective, focusing on the environment rather than a specific subject. Initially, a large red water slide occupies the center foreground of the frame. The surrounding area consists of tiled walls in the background at the top and right, and a tiled floor at the bottom. In the middle ground on the left, a metal handrail is visible next to a set of steps. The camera maintains its high-angle view as it moves steadily forward, pushing directly into the central opening of the red slide, causing the slide to progressively fill the entire frame.",
