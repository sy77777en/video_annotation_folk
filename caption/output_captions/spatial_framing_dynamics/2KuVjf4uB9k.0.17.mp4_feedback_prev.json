    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a red sports car drifting along a winding desert road. Initially, the car is positioned slightly off-center towards the left in the middle ground, with the road curving away into the background. The car occupies a significant portion of the frame, allowing a clear view of its dynamic movement. As the video progresses, the car drifts sharply, moving from the left side of the frame towards the center-right while kicking up a dense cloud of white smoke from its rear tires. This transition emphasizes the car's speed and agility. The surrounding environment, consisting of arid terrain and sparse vegetation, remains in the background throughout the video, providing a stark contrast to the smooth road. The camera maintains a consistent aerial perspective, positioned above the car, capturing the full scope of the action and the expansive desert landscape. The camera's height relative to the car ensures a comprehensive view of the car's trajectory and the surrounding scenery, highlighting the car's interaction with the winding road.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a red sports car prominently drifting on a winding desert road. The car is sleek and aerodynamic, with visible decals and a spoiler on the back. It emits a thick cloud of white smoke from its tires, indicating high-speed motion and sharp turns. The road is surrounded by arid, sandy terrain with sparse vegetation, enhancing the sense of speed and agility as the car maneuvers through the curves. The car's dynamic movement and the smoke trail are central to the scene, emphasizing the action and skill involved in the driving.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a dynamic scene set on a winding desert road. The environment is arid, with sparse vegetation and sandy terrain surrounding the asphalt. The time of day appears to be midday, with clear skies and bright sunlight casting sharp shadows. A red car is prominently featured, drifting around the curves of the road, creating plumes of smoke that trail behind it. The motion of the car and the dust it kicks up emphasize the speed and agility of the vehicle as it navigates the barren landscape. The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view of the scene, highlighting the contrast between the smooth road and the rugged desert backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
