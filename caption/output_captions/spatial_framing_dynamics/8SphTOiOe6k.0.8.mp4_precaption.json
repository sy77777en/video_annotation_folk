    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a street scene with several people and vehicles. A white car is driving along the road, while a few pedestrians walk on the sidewalk. Among the pedestrians, there are two women wearing long pants and carrying bags, and a man in casual attire walking with a woman wearing a yellow top over a white shirt and blue jeans. In the distance, a cyclist is riding towards the camera. The street is lined with traditional-style buildings and trees with autumn foliage, adding a seasonal touch to the scene. The overall atmosphere is calm and typical of a small town or suburban area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene captures a quiet, sunlit street in a small town, likely in Japan, with traditional wooden buildings lining both sides. The time of day is afternoon, as indicated by the clear blue sky and the long shadows cast on the ground. The street is paved and features a narrow sidewalk bordered by low stone walls and lush greenery. A few pedestrians and cyclists move leisurely along the street, adding a sense of calm activity. In the distance, a mountain range is visible, providing a scenic backdrop. The trees along the street display autumn colors, with leaves in shades of orange and red, enhancing the picturesque setting. The overall atmosphere is serene and inviting, with a blend of natural and architectural elements.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a sunlit street scene, capturing both people and vehicles within a small town setting. Initially, a white car is positioned in the middle ground, driving from the background towards the foreground, centrally aligned in the frame. Pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk to the right, with two women carrying bags and a man walking alongside a woman in a yellow top. These pedestrians are in the middle ground, moving from the background towards the foreground. A cyclist is seen in the distance, riding towards the camera, initially in the background and gradually moving to the middle ground. The street is lined with traditional buildings on both sides, with trees displaying autumn foliage, positioned in the background. The camera is at street level, providing a natural perspective of the scene. As the video progresses, the car moves closer to the foreground, while the pedestrians and cyclist advance towards the middle ground, maintaining a calm and steady pace.",
