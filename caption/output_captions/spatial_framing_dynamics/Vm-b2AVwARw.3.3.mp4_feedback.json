    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a cityscape, focusing on a prominent skyscraper centrally positioned in the frame. This tower, with its dark, reflective facade and distinctive curved design, is situated in the middle ground, dominating the scene. Surrounding the skyscraper are various high-rise buildings, positioned in the background, creating a dense skyline. The camera, positioned above the city, captures the urban environment from a high vantage point, emphasizing the scale and complexity of the metropolis. The shot remains consistent, maintaining the skyscraper's central position and the surrounding buildings' arrangement, highlighting the grandeur of the cityscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, showcasing a sprawling urban environment with a focus on a prominent, sleek skyscraper at its center. The tower features a dark, reflective facade with a distinctive, curved design that tapers towards the top, crowned by a metallic structure. Surrounding the skyscraper are numerous other high-rise buildings, varying in height and architectural style, creating a dense and dynamic skyline. The scene captures the essence of a bustling metropolis, emphasizing the scale and complexity of the urban landscape rather than focusing on a specific object or subject. The emphasis is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the grandeur and intricacy of the city as a whole.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone offers an aerial perspective of a modern cityscape model at either dawn or dusk, characterized by soft lighting and elongated shadows. Dominating the center is a tall, slender skyscraper with a dark, possibly metallic or glass facade, featuring a distinctive twisting design that culminates in a pointed apex. The surface of this central tower appears to have a pattern due to light passing through its hollow design. Surrounding this prominent structure are numerous abstract, three-dimensional models of buildings in varying heights and contemporary designs, including cylindrical and rectangular forms, rendered in muted tones of grey and light brown. The urban layout includes visible road networks, patches of undeveloped or green land, and bodies of water, such as canals or lakes, which reflect the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
