    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-brown-skinned girl with dark, curly hair lies in a bed, smiling and laughing. She is wearing a pink, long-sleeved, textured shirt and is propped up on grey pillows under a grey comforter. In the foreground, the hands of a light-skinned adult in a white shirt hold a sterile, packaged medical swab. The focus of the video shifts from the girl's face to the adult's hands holding the swab. In the bed with the girl are several stuffed toys, including a large pillow shaped like an animal with a red and white striped body and a white and pink plush toy with a fan-like tail.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, the scene is set within a softly lit bedroom that resembles early morning light. A young girl wearing a pink shirt lies smiling in a bed that has a black, metal-slatted headboard. The bed is dressed in grey pillows and a matching comforter. Beside the girl are several plush items, including a white rectangular pillow with a cartoon animal face and a red-and-white striped base, and another white plush object with pink, petal-like features. In the foreground, the character's hands hold a long, thin object sealed in a white wrapper.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned above the subject when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins as a medium shot with a young girl positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right of center, smiling in a bed. An adult's shoulder is visible in the out-of-focus foreground on the left, while stuffed toys are in the middle ground to the girl's left, and a headboard is in the background. The focus then shifts from the girl to the adult's hands, transitioning the shot into a close-up. In the final framing, the adult's hands holding a packaged swab are in sharp focus in the foreground at the bottom center, while the girl becomes an out-of-focus element in the background on the right. The camera is initially positioned slightly above the girl and becomes level with the hands after the focus pull.",
