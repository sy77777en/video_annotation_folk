    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man as the main subject, standing on a stage with a TEDx sign in the background. He is wearing a light-colored dress shirt and dark trousers. The man has a medium-dark skin tone and is bald. In the video, he transitions from standing still to making a dynamic gesture, suggesting he is speaking or presenting. The audience is visible in silhouette, indicating their presence but not their details. The setting suggests a formal presentation or talk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors on a stage with a TEDx backdrop, featuring large red and white letters set against a black background, with a blue-lit backdrop behind them. The setting is a dimly lit auditorium with an audience seated in the foreground, creating a contrast between the darkened seating area and the illuminated stage. The stage floor is wooden, adding a warm tone to the scene. The environment is formal and structured, with a focus on the speaker who is centrally positioned on the stage. The lighting highlights the speaker and the backdrop, emphasizing the presentation setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of the main subject, a man standing on a stage. Positioned in the center of the frame, he occupies the middle ground, with his entire figure visible from head to toe. The TEDx sign is located in the background, slightly to the right, with its large red and white letters prominently displayed. The audience sits in the foreground, appearing as silhouettes along the bottom edge of the frame. The man begins in a stationary stance, then shifts slightly, raising one arm while maintaining his central position. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, capturing the scene without any noticeable changes in angle or zoom. The spatial arrangement keeps the focus on the speaker, with the audience and backdrop providing context.",
