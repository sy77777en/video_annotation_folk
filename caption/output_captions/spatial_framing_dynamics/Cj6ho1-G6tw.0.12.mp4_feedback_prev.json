    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static extreme wide shot of a waterside landscape at dusk. A dark, silhouetted shoreline occupies the foreground across the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a long, illuminated suspension bridge stretches horizontally across the scene, with its main support tower positioned in the center-right. A body of water fills the middle ground beneath the bridge, displaying reflections from the bridge lights and from buildings situated on the left. The sky occupies the background in the upper portion of the frame, where a small puff of smoke or a cloud can be seen drifting from left to right in the top left. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking out from the foreground shoreline.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a tranquil cityscape scenery shot capturing a massive, illuminated suspension bridge spanning a wide body of water at dusk. The bridge's long deck is lined with evenly spaced lights, and its towering support structures are also lit, all casting a warm, golden reflection on the calm surface of the water below. In the foreground, the dark, wet silhouette of a rocky or muddy shoreline is visible, while the sky above fades from a deep, dusky orange and blue near the horizon to complete darkness. The video lacks a specific main subject, as the static, wide composition is intended to capture the serene atmosphere and the grand scale of the architectural marvel against the twilight sky. The focus is on the peaceful interplay between the man-made lights and the natural environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At dusk, a long suspension bridge with two prominent, red, lattice-style towers spans a wide, calm body of water. The scene is viewed from a dark, wet shoreline in the foreground, where pools of water mirror the surrounding lights. A continuous line of bright lights illuminates the bridge's deck, and their reflections, along with those from buildings on the near shore, shimmer on the water's surface. The sky transitions from a faint orange glow at the horizon to a deep, dark blue above. In the timelapse, clouds can be seen changing positions against the sky on the left.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
