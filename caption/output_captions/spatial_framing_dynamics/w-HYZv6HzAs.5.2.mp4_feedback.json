Behind the man, in the middle ground, a large \"TEDx Ryerson\" sign is positioned, with a stylized city skyline in the background. The man initially walks from the center towards the left side of the stage, then turns and walks back towards the center, where he stops and gestures with both hands. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a Black man who appears to have a shaved head, with a smooth scalp and slightly darker areas on the sides indicating some remaining hair roots. He is standing on a wooden stage, wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved button-down shirt and dark trousers. Throughout the video, he gestures with his hands and walks around the stage as he speaks. In the foreground, the silhouetted figures of an audience are seen from behind, sitting in rows and facing the stage.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A man stands on a light-colored wooden stage in front of a large sign that reads \"TEDx Ryerson\" in red and white letters. Behind the sign, a stylized city skyline silhouette is illuminated with blue lights against a dark backdrop. The stage is dimly lit, with spotlights focused on the speaker and the background elements. In the foreground, the silhouettes of an audience can be seen watching the presentation from their seats.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
