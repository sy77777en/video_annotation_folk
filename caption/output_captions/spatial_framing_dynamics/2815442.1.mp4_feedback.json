    "pre_caption": "The video captures an extreme wide shot of a serene landscape dominated by a vast body of water. The camera maintains a consistent aerial perspective throughout, positioned high above the scene. The water occupies the central portion of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. On the left side, dense greenery and forested areas are visible in the middle ground, while similar vegetation appears on the right side, also in the middle ground. In the background, rolling hills and distant mountains form a continuous horizon line across the top of the frame. Small islands with clusters of trees are situated near the center of the water, slightly towards the middle ground. Boats move across the water, leaving visible trails that stretch from the foreground towards the middle ground. The camera remains steady, with no noticeable changes in shot size or position, maintaining a broad view of the entire landscape. The sky, dotted with scattered clouds, forms the upper part of the frame, completing the expansive composition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot, focusing on a vast, serene body of water surrounded by lush greenery and distant hills. The emphasis is on the expansive environment, capturing the tranquil atmosphere and natural beauty of the area. The wide view showcases the scale of the landscape, with the water reflecting the sky and the greenery providing a rich contrast. The absence of a specific main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the overall harmony and peacefulness of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of a serene outdoor setting featuring a large, calm body of water surrounded by lush greenery. The scene is set during the day under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds. The expansive lake is bordered by dense forests and rolling hills, creating a picturesque landscape. The water is a deep blue, contrasting with the vibrant green of the trees. Small islands with clusters of trees are visible within the lake, adding to the natural beauty. Boats occasionally traverse the water's surface, leaving trails behind them, which adds a dynamic element to the tranquil scene. The distant mountains provide a majestic backdrop, enhancing the sense of tranquility and vastness in the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
