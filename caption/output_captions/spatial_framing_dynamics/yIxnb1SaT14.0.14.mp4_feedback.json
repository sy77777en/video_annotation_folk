The scene is dominated by a large, multi-story building with a curved facade, brilliantly illuminated by warm, yellow lights that highlight its classical details, numerous windows, and balconies. In the center of the cobblestone square stands a dark, bronze equestrian statue on a stone plinth. To the right, a prominent red neon sign for the \"THEATRE EDOUARD VII\" glows above an entrance flanked by red umbrellas and outdoor seating, while the ground-floor colonnade is lit with a cooler, greenish-white light, creating a striking visual contrast. The camera, positioned at a low angle, slowly pulls back, expanding the view to reveal more of the architectural space and the people walking through the illuminated archways in the middle ground.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dynamic cityscape scene of a grand, semicircular courtyard at night. The slow, pulling-back camera movement captures the impressive scale and atmosphere of the entire architectural space, while a fast-moving crowd navigates through the area, adding a lively element to the serene nighttime setting. The scene is dominated by a large, multi-story building with a curved facade, brilliantly illuminated by warm, yellow lights that highlight its classical details, numerous windows, and balconies. In the center of the cobblestone square stands a dark, bronze equestrian statue on a stone plinth. To the right, a prominent red neon sign for the \"THEATRE EDOUARD VII\" glows above an entrance flanked by red umbrellas and outdoor seating, while the ground-floor colonnade is lit with a cooler, greenish-white light, creating a striking visual contrast.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A nighttime shot captures the Place \u00c9douard VII in Paris, centered on a bronze equestrian statue on a stone pedestal. The statue is positioned in a courtyard enclosed by a grand, multi-story building with a curved, light-colored stone facade. The upper levels of the building are bathed in warm, yellow light, while the ground level features a series of large arches. To the right of the statue is the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre \u00c9douard VII, marked by a prominent red neon sign. People can be seen walking in both the foreground and middle ground under the illuminated archways. The camera slowly zooms out, expanding the view of the architectural space. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANI\u0106 CINEMATOGRAPHER\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
