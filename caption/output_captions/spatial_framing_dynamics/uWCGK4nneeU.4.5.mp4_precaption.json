    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a mountain range under a clear blue sky, with a prominent white cloud at the center. Initially, the scene is static, focusing on the natural landscape. As the video progresses, a helicopter enters from the left, characterized by its small size, dark color, and a darker contrail that stands out against the clear sky. A plane enters from the right, notable for its larger size, red color, and a gray, cone-like structure attached to its rear by strings, from which it releases a white contrail. Both aircraft move toward the center, where the cloud is located, occupying about 10% of the frame's height. The helicopter and plane are distinct in their movement and color, contrasting with the serene backdrop of the mountains and sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a vast desert landscape under a clear blue sky, with rolling dunes and distant mountain ranges. A single, fluffy white cloud floats in the center of the scene, contrasting with the arid, brown terrain. The environment is dry and barren, with no vegetation visible. The time of day is likely midday, as indicated by the bright lighting and absence of shadows. In the latter part of the video, two aircraft appear, trailing smoke as they move across the sky, adding dynamic motion to the otherwise still setting. The scene maintains an objective perspective, capturing the expansive and open nature of the desert.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a mountain range and the sky, initially fully in focus, with a cloud at the center of the frame. Shortly after, a helicopter enters from the left and a plane from the right, moving simultaneously toward the frame's center, occupying about 10% of the frame's height.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subjects appear, the camera is below the subjects, and the camera height remains unchanged.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a vast desert landscape, with the entire mountain range and sky visible. The scene begins with a static view, featuring a prominent white cloud centered in the upper middle portion of the frame, positioned in the background. The mountain range spans the horizon, forming the middle ground, while the foreground consists of rolling dunes. Initially, there are no significant subjects in the frame. As the video progresses, a helicopter enters from the left side, occupying the left middle portion of the frame and moving towards the center. Simultaneously, a plane enters from the right, appearing in the right middle portion and also moving towards the center. Both aircraft maintain a consistent altitude, with the camera positioned below them, capturing their movement across the sky. The helicopter and plane gradually approach the central cloud, converging near the middle of the frame. Throughout the sequence, the camera height remains constant, keeping the subjects and scenery in a steady perspective. The helicopter and plane occupy approximately 10% of the frame's height, emphasizing their movement against the expansive backdrop.",
