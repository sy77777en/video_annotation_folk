    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A scenic landscape shot highlighting the environment and atmosphere, featuring buildings, trees, and sky to convey the scale and ambiance of the setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting at dusk, featuring a quiet, rural landscape. The scene includes a small, weathered building with a sloped roof, constructed from dark, textured material. Nearby, a simple metal structure, possibly a shed, stands with a corrugated surface. A prominent tower at the center of the frame but slightly towards the right rises against the dimming sky, adding to the rustic atmosphere. The ground is covered with scattered debris, suggesting a neglected area. A single utility pole stands without wires, contributing to the rural ambiance. The sky transitions from a pale gray to a desaturated orange near the horizon, indicating either sunset or sunrise. A small white text overlay, marked [10], is located in the bottom left corner without obstructing the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a rural landscape at dusk. The camera remains stationary throughout, capturing the scene consistently. In the foreground, the ground is covered with scattered debris, occupying the bottom portion of the frame. A small, weathered building with a sloped roof is positioned on the left side, in the middle ground. Adjacent to it, a simple metal structure, likely a shed, is also in the middle ground, slightly to the right. A prominent tower is centrally located but slightly towards the right, standing in the background. A single utility pole without wires is situated in the middle ground, near the center-left. Two trees are visible; one is in the middle ground, slightly right of center, while the other is further right, closer to the edge of the frame. The sky, transitioning from pale gray to desaturated orange near the horizon, forms the backdrop. The camera's height is level with the middle ground structures, providing a clear view of the entire scene. There are no changes in shot size or spatial position during the video. A small white text overlay, marked [10], is consistently placed in the bottom left corner.",
