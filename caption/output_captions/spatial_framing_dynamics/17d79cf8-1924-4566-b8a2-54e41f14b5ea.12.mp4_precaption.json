    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a person with a light to medium skin tone is visible, wearing a long-sleeved, light-colored shirt and blue flip-flops. A black bracelet is on their right wrist, and their right hand is extended toward a large, disorganized pile of reddish-orange clay bricks on the dirt ground. Some of the bricks are broken. To the left of the person's feet sits a shallow, wide, light-colored bowl containing a dark grey residue. In the upper left, the light-brown, fibrous bristles of a traditional broom are visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a scene at an outdoor work site during the day. The ground consists of uneven, reddish-brown earth littered with debris. A large pile of rectangular red bricks, many of which are broken and have a rough, textured surface, occupies the center of the view. Near the person's feet, which are in light blue flip-flops, rests a shallow, grey, circular basin containing some residue. In the upper left, the light-brown, fibrous bristles of a traditional broom are visible, while a thin white wire is tangled among the bricks. The person's arm, covered by a light-colored sleeve and adorned with a dark bracelet, extends towards the pile of bricks.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the scene is framed looking down towards the ground. The person's legs and feet are positioned at the bottom center in the immediate foreground, with their right arm extending from the bottom right towards the center of the frame. A large pile of red bricks dominates the top and center of the frame in the middle ground. In the foreground, a shallow bowl is located in the bottom left, and the bristles of a broom are visible in the top left corner. A thin white wire rests on the bricks in the top right.",
