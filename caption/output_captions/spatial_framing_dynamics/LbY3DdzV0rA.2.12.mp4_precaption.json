    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot, where the focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a single subject. A vast, turbulent mass of dark, brooding storm clouds dominates the sky, churning ominously over a wide, arid desert plain. The clouds are a deep grey, almost black in the densest areas, while a curtain of heavy rain is visible falling in the distance. The flat, brownish-yellow landscape below is sparsely covered with scrub brush and extends towards a faint mountain range on the horizon, creating a powerful sense of natural drama and scale.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse video shows a dramatic storm system moving across a vast, arid landscape. The sky is filled with massive, dark gray and black clouds that swirl and churn, with some brighter white clouds and a patch of blue sky visible above. Below the turbulent cloud base, a distinct shaft of heavy rain falls in the distance. The foreground consists of a flat, brown plain with sparse, dry vegetation, and a low mountain range is visible on the far horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a vast landscape, with no single subject as the focus. The top two-thirds of the frame are dominated by a massive formation of dark storm clouds in the middle ground sky, positioned above a flat desert plain that occupies the bottom third of the frame in the foreground and middle ground. On the far left horizon, a faint mountain range sits in the background. Throughout the time-lapse, the clouds churn and expand across the frame, with a prominent dark section on the right growing larger. A shaft of rain is visible falling in the background on the right. The lower, central part of the cloud base shows significant swirling motion, appearing to descend closer to the horizon. The camera is positioned at a low, stationary height, emphasizing the immense scale of the storm system.",
