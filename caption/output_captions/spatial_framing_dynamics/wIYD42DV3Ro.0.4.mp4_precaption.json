    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of horses with jockeys competes in a horse race, viewed from an overhead angle as they round a turn on a brown dirt track. The jockeys wear brightly colored silks and helmets in various combinations, including a yellow and black checkered pattern, solid purple, blue with a yellow star, and red and white. The horses, mostly brown with one grey horse visible, run in a large pack. A graphical overlay in the lower-left corner identifies the race as the \"148TH KENTUCKY DERBY\" and lists several horses by number, name, and odds, such as #6 Messier at 7-1 and #3 Epicenter, the 4-1 favorite. Another graphic in the upper-right corner displays the race time at the half-mile and three-quarter-mile marks, along with a television network logo.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A television broadcast-style viewpoint captures a horse race in progress on a wide, light-brown dirt track bordered by a white inner rail. Inside the rail, a strip of green grass is visible. A large pack of horses, ridden by jockeys in brightly colored silks, gallops along the track, moving from right to left. The scene includes several on-screen graphic overlays. In the top right corner, a gold-bordered box displays race statistics, such as \"1/2 MILE 45.36\" and \"3/4 MILE 1:10.34,\" alongside a network logo. In the bottom left corner, another overlay provides information for the \"148TH KENTUCKY DERBY,\" listing the names, numbers, and odds of several horses, including \"EPICENTER\" marked as the \"FAVORITE.\" A thick white line runs down the inside of the track, and the horses run along it.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, a large pack of racehorses and jockeys is positioned in the middle ground, occupying the center and right portions of the frame. A brown dirt track fills the scene, with a white inner rail and a strip of green grass visible in the foreground at the bottom left. As the race progresses, the pack of horses moves from right to left across the frame, following the curve of the track and shifting slightly toward the foreground. The camera pans left to track their movement, keeping the main group of racers centered. Throughout the shot, a static graphic overlay remains in the bottom-left corner of the foreground, and another is fixed in the top-right corner.",
