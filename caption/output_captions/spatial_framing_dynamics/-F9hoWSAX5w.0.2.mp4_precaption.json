    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a dimly lit urban street scene with three distinct individuals. One person, wearing dark clothing and a hooded jacket, walks slightly ahead holding an umbrella. Behind them, two others walk side by side, each carrying a coffee. The street is lined with buildings featuring illuminated signs, including a recognizable fast-food logo and a pub sign. A few pigeons are visible on the ground, adding to the urban atmosphere. The overall scene conveys a typical city street with pedestrians and ambient lighting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of an urban street scene with a somewhat dark and overcast sky, making it challenging to determine the exact time of day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a narrow city street lined with buildings. Notable elements include a McDonald's sign on the left and a pub sign further down the street, indicating a lively area. The wet pavement reflects the glow of streetlights, suggesting recent rain. Pigeons are visible on the ground, adding to the urban atmosphere. The scene captures the movement of pedestrians walking along the sidewalk, contributing to the dynamic city environment. The overall ambiance is characterized by the interplay of artificial lights and the damp street, creating a typical cityscape.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of an urban street scene, capturing the full length of the sidewalk and the surrounding buildings. Initially, one individual in dark clothing and a hooded jacket is positioned near the center of the frame, walking away from the camera in the foreground. This person holds an umbrella and moves steadily forward. As the video progresses, two additional individuals appear from the left side of the frame, entering the middle ground. They walk side by side behind the first person, each carrying a coffee. These three figures maintain their respective positions throughout the video, with the initial individual remaining slightly ahead. The buildings line both sides of the street, with illuminated signs such as a fast-food logo on the left and a pub sign further down the road, situated in the background. Streetlights cast a warm glow, reflecting off the wet pavement, which occupies the lower portion of the frame. Pigeons are scattered across the sidewalk, primarily in the foreground and middle ground. The camera remains at eye level relative to the subjects, providing a consistent perspective of the scene. The spatial arrangement and movement of the subjects create a dynamic flow along the urban street.",
