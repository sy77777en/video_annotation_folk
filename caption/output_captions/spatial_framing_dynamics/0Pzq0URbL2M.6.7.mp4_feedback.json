    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a serene outdoor landscape during sunset. The camera remains stationary throughout, capturing the expansive view. The railway track runs centrally through the scene, extending from the foreground into the middle ground and converging towards the horizon. On the left side of the frame, trees are positioned in the middle ground, while brick buildings with dark roofs occupy the right side, also in the middle ground. The buildings are closer to the camera compared to the trees. The sky, filled with warm hues of orange and yellow, dominates the upper portion of the frame, forming the background. The sun is near the horizon, slightly off-center to the left. The camera's height is elevated, providing a clear view over the railway track and the surrounding structures. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the video; the elements maintain their initial positions and proportions. The text \"[8]\" is consistently visible in the lower left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, capturing the expansive view of the sunset, sky, and surrounding buildings. The emphasis is on the overall mood and scale of the scene rather than a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting at sunset, showcasing a quiet rural scene with a road and railway track running parallel. The environment features a few brick buildings with simple, angular shapes and dark roofs, positioned on either side of the road. The sky is filled with soft, warm hues of orange and yellow, with scattered clouds partially obscuring the sun as it sets on the horizon. Trees with sparse foliage are visible, contributing to the tranquil atmosphere. There is added text in the lower left corner that shows \"[8]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
