    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a group of people sitting on a sun-dappled, leafy hillside from a low angle, looking upward. In the center, an individual with dark curly hair and a dark t-shirt is seated facing slightly to the right. Another person, wearing a dark hooded garment, is seated higher up on the left. The composition includes out-of-focus foliage in the foreground, partially obscuring parts of the scene, while other less distinct figures form a scattered group in the natural setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds on a sunlit, wooded hillside under a clear blue sky. The ground slopes upward, covered in brown fallen leaves, green plants, and scattered concrete blocks. In the background, a line of tall, bare trees is silhouetted against the bright sky. The entire scene is viewed through a hazy, soft-focus filter, creating bright, circular lens flares and a dream-like visual quality. Blurred green foliage is visible in the foreground. A group of people are resting on the hillside, sitting and lying among the rocks and vegetation.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, a group of people is framed from a low-angle perspective on a hillside. Out-of-focus foliage occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame, creating depth. The group is positioned in the middle ground on the upward slope; a central figure sits in the middle of the frame, while another person is located higher up in the upper left. Other individuals are scattered around them in the middle ground. The background, filling the top of the frame, consists of bare trees against the sky. The camera is positioned below the subjects, looking up at them.",
