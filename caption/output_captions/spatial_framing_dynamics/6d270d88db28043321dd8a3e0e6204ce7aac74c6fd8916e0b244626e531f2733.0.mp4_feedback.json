    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide, high-angle aerial shot of a vast waterscape. A sandy peninsula, which hosts numerous boats and a small hut, is positioned in the bottom right foreground. The large body of water extends from the foreground through the middle ground, where several low-lying islands are scattered; a distinct island sits in the center, with larger land formations on the left. The background is composed of flat plains that stretch across the upper portion of the frame, meeting an overcast sky at the distant horizon. The camera maintains a fixed position, capturing the expansive and static composition of the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an aerial landscape scenery shot of a vast, tranquil river or lake under a soft, overcast sky tinged with pink and purple hues. The expansive body of water is dotted with low-lying, sandy islands and peninsulas, one of which hosts a small settlement with a simple wooden structure and numerous long, narrow boats moored along its shore. In the distance, flat, green plains stretch to a hazy horizon. The video lacks a main subject because its high-angle, wide perspective is intended to emphasize the immense scale of the natural environment and create a serene, atmospheric mood. The composition highlights the relationship between the water, the land, and the small human presence within the vast landscape, rather than focusing on any single element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of a vast, tranquil waterscape at either dawn or dusk. The scene is dominated by a large, calm body of water with a greenish hue, its low levels exposing sandy peninsulas and small, sparsely vegetated islands. An overcast sky with soft pink and purple tones hangs above a hazy, flat landscape in the distance. In the foreground, a sandy spit of land serves as a mooring point for numerous long, narrow blue boats, which are gathered near a small, rustic hut. A few people are visible on the shore near the boats.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
