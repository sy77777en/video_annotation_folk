    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video shows a first-person perspective of a Minecraft gameplay session. The player is building a large, complex structure made of smooth, white blocks high up in the sky. A white block is visible in the bottom-right corner, as if it is being held. The player places the block onto the structure and then breaks the excess ones, causing them to shatter into a cloud of smaller white particles. The game's user interface is present, with a hotbar at the bottom showing various blocks, including white, glowing blue, diamond, and red types. In the top-left corner, a small avatar with orange hair and a green shirt is visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, takes place high in the sky within a Minecraft world. The scene is set during the daytime, with a clear blue sky and blocky white clouds. The viewpoint is focused on a large, complex structure made of smooth, white blocks, which has a layered design. In the distance below, a green landscape is visible. During the clip, some white blocks are placed onto the structure, and the excess ones are then broken, causing them to shatter into small particles. A small character model is visible in the upper left corner. The scene includes several overlay elements: in the bottom left, an inventory hotbar displays various blocks, with the white block selected. In the bottom right, controller prompts for \"Place,\" \"Mine,\" \"Drop,\" and \"Emote\" are visible. A small black crosshair is centered on the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the camera is positioned below a large, white block structure that dominates the foreground from the center to the top and right of the frame. In the extreme foreground, a white block being held is visible in the bottom-right corner. The background on the left and top of the frame shows a blue sky with clouds, while a distant landscape is visible in the bottom-right background. A small avatar is fixed in the top-left corner, an inventory bar is at the bottom-left, and button prompts are at the bottom-right. The camera's central crosshair aims up at the structure, and a block is placed in the center-right, extending the structure toward the viewer. The camera then re-aims at this block, which shatters into particles that expand outward from the center of the screen.",
