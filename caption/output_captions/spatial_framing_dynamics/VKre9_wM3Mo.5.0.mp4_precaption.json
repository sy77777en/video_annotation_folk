    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A translucent white humanoid figure is depicted kneeling on a reflective surface, its face pressed to the ground, oriented towards a solid gray, opaque toilet stall. A distinct red cross pattern is visible on the back of this kneeling figure. The view then moves to reveal, through a gap at the bottom of the stall door, the bare, light-skinned lower legs and feet of a second humanoid figure, who appears to be seated on a white toilet, of which only the lower portion is visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark environment with a reflective gray floor. In the foreground, a translucent, white, human-like figure is on its hands and knees, facing away from the viewer. A red cross-shaped overlay is visible on its upper back. In front of this figure is a gray, translucent bathroom stall. The stall door is closed, but the bottom of the stall is open, revealing a white toilet and a pair of white feet standing inside. The camera moves forward and downward towards the stall.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a humanoid subject with a red cross pattern behind them, kneeling on the ground in front of what appears to be a toilet stall in a dark background. The subject's face is pressed to the floor, facing the toilet stall. As the camera moves closer and descends, it reveals the lower legs of another humanoid subject in the toilet stall, who seems to be sitting on a toilet.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a translucent white humanoid figure kneeling in the foreground, positioned in the bottom left of the frame, its back with a red cross pattern facing the viewer. A gray, opaque toilet stall occupies the middle ground, extending from the center to the right side of the frame. Initially, only the bare feet of a second figure are visible in the center, within the middle ground, seen through the gap at the bottom of the stall door. The camera then moves forward and descends. As it moves, the kneeling figure in the foreground becomes larger, and its upper body moves towards the bottom edge of the frame. Simultaneously, the toilet stall in the middle ground also appears to move closer and fills more of the frame. The downward tilt of the camera reveals more of the interior of the stall, showing the lower legs of the second figure and the lower portion of a white toilet, both remaining in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The camera is initially positioned above the kneeling subject and then changes to be at the subject's level, looking slightly upwards towards the gap in the stall.",
