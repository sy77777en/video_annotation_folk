    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, showing a large, luminous blue orb in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. A small, white, bipedal creature stands on a platform slightly left of center, also in the middle ground. Gnarled tree branches frame the scene from the foreground and middle ground, while misty clouds occupy the bottom foreground. A notification is fixed in the top-left corner, and a heads-up display is at the bottom center. As the central orb's light fades, the shot transitions to a wide shot, zooming in and tilting up. The small white creature jumps from its platform toward the top-center of the frame. A large winged creature then descends from the top-center before flying upwards and away into the background. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a mystical, dark forest setting, a large, luminous blue-white orb is encased within a dark, swirling, vine-like structure, emitting powerful beams of purple and white light. The scene is a 2D game environment presented from a side view, featuring an unconventional character design. A small, bipedal creature, entirely white and glowing with long ears and a slender body, is present.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video, the scene is set within a dark, mystical forest environment. Gnarled, dark tree branches and trunks dominate the landscape, framing a central, large, glowing blue orb that pulsates with purple light and is encased in a thorny, cage-like structure. The ground is composed of floating platforms amidst misty, purple-blue clouds, with waterfalls cascading in the background. A small, white, glowing creature is seen on a platform as a larger, winged creature flies away from the central orb. The air is filled with floating, glowing particles. Overlays are present on the screen: a notification in the top-left corner reads \"ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED RUN FOR YOUR LIFE,\" and a heads-up display with various icons is visible at the bottom center.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
