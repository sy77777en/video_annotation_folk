    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot from an elevated perspective, capturing a historic European square as it transitions from bright daylight to illuminated night and back to daylight, highlighting the full cycle of the day. The focus is not on a singular subject but rather on the grand architectural ensemble and the evolving atmosphere of the urban space, emphasizing the scale and timelessness of the structures. Central to the view is an octagonal baptistery, distinguished by its white and green marble striped facade, arched windows, and pyramidal roof, standing adjacent to a partially visible, elaborately decorated cathedral with a prominent bell tower. The paved square below teems with people during the day, their movements transforming into blurred streaks under the artificial glow of streetlights and building illuminations at night, conveying a sense of continuous activity against the backdrop of enduring historical architecture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a high-angle view of a bustling European city square, identified as Piazza del Duomo in Florence, Italy, transitioning from bright daylight to illuminated night and then back to daylight. Dominating the center is the octagonal Florence Baptistery, constructed with distinctive white and green marble in horizontal bands and featuring arched windows and a domed roof. To the left, a portion of the larger Florence Cathedral (Duomo) is visible, showcasing similar white and green marble, a prominent rose window, and part of its bell tower. The square is paved and surrounded by multi-story buildings of varying architectural styles, predominantly in shades of yellow and beige, with numerous windows. During the day, many people are seen walking around the square. As the scene shifts to night, the buildings and the Baptistery are illuminated by artificial lights, and the movement of people becomes blurred streaks, indicating a time-lapse effect. The sky changes from clear blue to dark and then back to daylight, with streetlights and building lights creating a warm glow in the urban environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video utilizes an extreme wide shot from a high-angle, elevated perspective, maintaining a static frame throughout. The octagonal Florence Baptistery is the central element, positioned in the middle ground of the frame. To its left and extending towards the top left, a portion of the Florence Cathedral and its bell tower are visible, also situated in the middle ground. The paved square surrounds the Baptistery, occupying the foreground and extending into the middle ground, primarily visible in the bottom and center-right portions of the frame, where numerous people are seen moving during daylight, transitioning to blurred light streaks at night. Multi-story buildings are positioned on the right side of the frame and also form the background behind the main structures, existing in both the middle ground and background.",
