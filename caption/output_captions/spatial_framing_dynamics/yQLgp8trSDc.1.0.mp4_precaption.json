    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is an East Asian man with a thin mustache and black hair styled away from his face, wearing a dark blue, round-collared tunic. He stands in the center with a tense expression, looking forward and slightly to his right. He is surrounded by other East Asian men dressed in official-looking grey and black robes with distinctive black, boxy hats. The man immediately to the main subject's left is holding the other end of the sword, while an older man to his right holds the sword with the blade resting on his shoulder. Two men in similar attire are visible in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors within a dimly lit room with dark-colored walls. A light-colored, repeating geometric meander pattern is visible as a decorative border along the top of the wall in the background. A man in a simple, dark blue tunic stands in the center, surrounded by several other men dressed in grey and black period uniforms accented with yellow fabric. These uniformed men wear tall, black, rectangular hats. A straight, metallic sword is held horizontally in the scene, its blade positioned behind the central man.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. He is flanked by a man to his left, who is slightly in the foreground, and an older man to his right in the middle ground. A sword is held horizontally across the scene, with its blade positioned behind the central man's neck. Two other men stand in the background on the left and right sides of the frame. The camera then pulls back, transitioning to a medium shot that reveals more of the subjects' torsos while they maintain their relative positions. Throughout the shot, the camera remains at the subjects' level.",
