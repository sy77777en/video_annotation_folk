    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture a city intersection from a first-person perspective, with no main subject present. The sidewalk with a yellow tactile paving strip and black metal railings occupies the bottom left and extends into the foreground and middle ground, leading the viewer\u2019s eye toward the center and right of the frame. Street signs and utility poles are positioned in the left and center foreground, while a large metal-backed sign appears in the right foreground in the second frame. The road, marked with orange traffic cones, runs horizontally through the middle ground, with vehicles such as white and red cars moving from left to right across the center and right of the frame. Lush green trees and a partially visible building with a sloped roof form the background, spanning the upper half of the frame, while the blue sky with scattered clouds fills the top background. The camera remains at approximately eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent height relative to the sidewalk and street elements. The spatial framing shifts slightly as the camera moves forward along the sidewalk, causing foreground elements like railings and signs to pass from left to right and briefly obscure the view before revealing more of the intersection and background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban intersection bordered by lush green trees and a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The scene features a wide, clean sidewalk with a tactile paving strip, black metal railings, and various street signs and traffic cones, while several vehicles, including white and red cars, are visible on the road. The focus is on the overall environment, highlighting the harmonious blend of urban infrastructure and natural elements, rather than emphasizing any single object or individual. There is no main subject because the intent is to convey the atmosphere and scale of the cityscape, immersing the viewer in the setting itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moving along a city sidewalk bordered by a black metal railing with vertical bars and a yellow tactile paving strip set into gray tiles. The setting is outdoors at a street intersection, with several vehicles, including white and red cars, moving in an orderly manner at a crosswalk marked by orange traffic cones. Lush green trees line the background, partially obscuring a building with a sloped roof, while a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds suggests daytime and fair weather. Street signs, utility poles, and a large metal-backed sign with visible bolts and a reflective surface are positioned near the sidewalk, and the overall environment is clean and orderly.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
