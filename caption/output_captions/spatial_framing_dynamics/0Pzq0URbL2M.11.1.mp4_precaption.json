    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit room, four individuals with dark skin and short hair are wearing dark jackets. Two of them are seated at a long, dark brown table in the foreground, each with a white sheet of paper in front of them and a stack of papers between them. In the middle ground, two more individuals in dark jackets are positioned, while two people in white coats stand side-by-side, holding and looking down at open books. Other blurred, seated figures in dark clothing flank the standing figures.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark, shadowy room around a large, dark brown conference table. In the foreground, the silhouettes of two people are visible from behind as they sit at the table, which has papers and a stack of documents on its surface. Across from them, the background is dimly lit and heavily blurred, showing several other figures. Two of these background figures are standing, dressed in what appear to be white coats, and are holding large documents. The minimal lighting casts deep shadows, obscuring most details and creating a somber atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static medium shot, the scene is framed from the perspective of someone seated at a long, dark brown conference table. In the foreground, the backs of two figures are visible at the bottom left and bottom right, sitting at the table which extends across the lower half of the frame. On the table in the foreground are white papers and a stack of documents positioned in the center-left and center-right. The background is out of focus, showing several silhouetted figures. At the center of the background, two standing figures in white coats are positioned side-by-side, flanked by other blurred, seated figures. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
