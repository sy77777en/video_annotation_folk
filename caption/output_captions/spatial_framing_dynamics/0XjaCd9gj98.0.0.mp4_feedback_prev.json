    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a full shot of a toy rocket, which is centrally positioned in the foreground throughout the scene. Initially, the partial face of a young man occupies the right foreground. In the middle ground, several people are visible to the right, standing in a grassy field backed by bare trees. As the central toy rocket is lifted and moves horizontally from right to left, the camera, fixed at the subject's level, pans with it. This movement causes the background to shift, revealing a paved road, a red car on the left, and a dark SUV on the right. The people in the middle ground also move across the frame from right to left as the perspective changes. The toy rocket remains consistently sized and centered, while the surrounding environment is revealed through the camera's movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The central subject is a black, toy rocket with a bright red interior, inside of which stands a black, retro-style toy robot with red feet, a silver ribbed head, and a square torso. To the right, the partial face of a young man with fair skin and dark, shaggy hair, wearing a dark jacket, is visible in the foreground. In the background, several other people are present in a grassy field: a man in a blue jacket, a woman in a dark coat, and another person standing near a camera tripod. A red car and a dark SUV are also visible in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, fixed to a central object, shows a black, vintage-style toy robot with red feet standing inside an open-fronted, rocket-shaped container. The container is black on the outside with a bright red interior. The scene is set outdoors in a grassy, rural landscape under an overcast sky, with bare trees in the background. As the object is lifted and moves, the perspective pans across the scenery, revealing a narrow paved road with a parked red car, a black SUV, and a few people observing from a distance in the field.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: Overall, the video features a full shot of a flying toy resembling a rocket. However, at the beginning, part of a person's face appears on the right side of the frame, along with three other people in the middle ground. As the subject ascends into the sky, a broader landscape is revealed. The subject is shown in the same size throughout the video.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
