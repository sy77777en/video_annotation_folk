    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures a heavy metal door positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene. A small porthole is located in the upper-center of the door, with a larger wheel mechanism directly below it in the center. A rectangular sign labeled \"TOP SECRET\" is situated in the lower-center of the door. The door is flanked by dark, ribbed walls in the foreground on the left and right sides of the frame. The camera remains static and is positioned at the door's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A heavy, oblong metal door, similar in appearance to a vault or submarine hatch, is bathed in a strong, pulsating red light. The door's surface is a dark, reddish-brown color, showing signs of rust and wear. It is designed with a small, circular porthole near its top and a larger, circular wheel mechanism with six spokes in its center. Directly below the wheel, a rectangular plaque is attached, displaying the words \"TOP SECRET\" in capital letters. The door is set within a thick, matching frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene shows a heavy, weathered metal door illuminated by a strong red light. The door, which has a rounded rectangular shape, features a small circular porthole at the top and a six-spoked wheel handle in the center. It is flanked by dark, metallic walls with vertical, ribbed structures. A sign emitting a red glow with the text \"TOP SECRET\" is positioned on the lower section of the door. In the lower left corner of the screen, there is a very small white logo.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
