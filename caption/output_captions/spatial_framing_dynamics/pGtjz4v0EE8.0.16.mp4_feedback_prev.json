    "pre_caption": "This scenery video begins with a wide shot of a basilica, which is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, viewed from a low angle looking up. A clear blue sky occupies the top of the frame in the background. In the middle ground to the left, other buildings and a statue are visible. People are scattered across the foreground at the bottom of the frame, on the steps and in the square. The shot then executes a slow, steady zoom-in, transitioning to a medium-long shot that focuses on the central section of the basilica's facade. This movement brings the main portal, the circular window, and the upper pediment to dominate the frame, while the people in the foreground and the buildings on the far left are partially cropped out.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, featuring a slow zoom towards the ornate facade of a magnificent, white marble basilica under a brilliant blue sky. The Gothic Revival architecture is characterized by its intricate carvings, pointed arches, a large central circular window, and a prominent Star of David set within the main pediment. There is no single main subject, as the shot is designed to immerse the viewer in the grandeur and architectural splendor of the location. The focus is on capturing the atmosphere and impressive scale of the building, making the environment itself the primary point of interest rather than any specific person or object within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunlit outdoor square in Florence, Italy, the ornate facade of the Basilica of Santa Croce stands against a clear blue sky. The building's exterior is decorated with geometric patterns of white and green marble. It features a large, circular window above the central portal, pointed arches, and numerous spires. A prominent blue Star of David is set within the main gable. To the left, other buildings with yellow facades and a statue are visible. People are gathered throughout the square and on the steps of the basilica as the view slowly zooms in on the central architectural details of the church.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
