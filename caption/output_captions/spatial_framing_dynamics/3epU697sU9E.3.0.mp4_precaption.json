    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures the immediate aftermath of an incident at a large, dark-colored building, with thick, dark grey and white smoke billowing from a section of the structure, obscuring parts of its facade. In the middle ground towards the right rear of the scene, emergency vehicles, including red fire trucks and a yellow tanker truck, are positioned near the impact site. An individual in light-colored clothing is walking from left to right on the lawn, apparently filming the situation at the building. A silver minivan is parked adjacent to the roadside railing. In the foreground, two cars are visible driving past consecutively from right to left. The shot lacks a single main subject, aiming to convey the scale and chaotic atmosphere of the emergency by focusing on the overall environment of the disaster rather than any specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a broadcast-style viewpoint used in television production, capturing an outdoor scene at the Pentagon during the daytime. A large, dark, multi-story building is seen with thick plumes of dark grey and white smoke billowing from one section. In front of the building, on a grassy area, several emergency vehicles, including red and yellow fire trucks, are present. A paved road with a guardrail runs across the foreground, where a silver minivan is stationary next to the roadside railing, while two other cars drive past consecutively from right to left. A few individuals can be seen standing on the grass between the road and the building. An overlay in the lower-left corner displays a red and white logo with the word 'LIVE' above the number '9'.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide, static scenery shot captures a large building occupying the background and spanning the width of the frame, with smoke billowing from its center-left section. In the middle ground, emergency vehicles are positioned on the right, while a few individuals stand on the lawn; one person is seen walking from left to right near the center. The foreground is dominated by a road and guardrail running horizontally across the bottom. A stationary minivan is parked in the right foreground, as other cars drive past from right to left in the immediate foreground. A broadcast overlay is fixed in the bottom-left corner. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking across the road toward the building.",
