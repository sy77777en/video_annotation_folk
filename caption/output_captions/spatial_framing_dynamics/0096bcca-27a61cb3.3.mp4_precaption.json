    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot from the perspective of a vehicle driving down a multi-lane road at night. The scene is dark, illuminated primarily by red traffic lights, the headlights of distant cars, and a bright overhead streetlight that creates a prominent lens flare. A large semi-truck with a slatted trailer travels alongside the camera on the right, while on the left, a building is distinguished by its vibrant purple and green neon lighting. There is no main subject because the focus is on capturing the overall atmosphere and environment of an urban night drive; the moving point-of-view and wide perspective are used to convey a sense of place rather than to highlight a specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures the scene ahead as it proceeds down a multi-lane city street at night. The dark, paved road is marked with white lines and illuminated by streetlights and the red glow of traffic signals at an intersection. To the right, a large semi-truck with a slatted, cage-like trailer moves forward. On the left, a building is distinguished by a roofline outlined in bright purple and green neon lights. Dark trees line the side of the road, and the headlights of distant vehicles are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from a low, forward-facing camera position inside a moving vehicle. Initially, a large semi-truck is positioned in the right-middle ground, partially framed by dark trees in the right foreground. On the left, a building with neon lights occupies the left-middle ground, while the road extends from the bottom of the frame into the center background where red traffic lights are visible. As the camera moves forward, the semi-truck also advances, growing larger to dominate the right side of the frame before its trailer begins to exit on the right. Simultaneously, the neon-lit building on the left moves toward the edge of the frame and exits. A bright lens flare from an overhead light appears in the top-center of the frame as the vehicle approaches the intersection.",
