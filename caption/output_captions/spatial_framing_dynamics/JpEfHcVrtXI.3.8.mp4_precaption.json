    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a small figure wearing a bright yellow raincoat with a hood, which obscures their face and adds an atypical appearance against the dim surroundings. The figure is approximately half the height of the bed in the frame, suggesting a child-like or diminutive stature. The raincoat is the most striking element, contrasting sharply with the dark, muted tones of the room. The figure interacts with a bed, which has a simple metal frame and white bedding, and a wooden chest nearby. The lighting highlights the yellow raincoat, emphasizing its vividness in the otherwise shadowy environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the scene is set within a dark, sparsely furnished room with bluish-gray walls and a wooden plank floor. The space is dimly lit, containing a simple metal-frame bed with a white mattress, a wooden chest positioned to the left side of the bed, and a tall wooden crate on the right. A small metal opening, possibly a window, is affixed to the back wall. A small figure in a bright yellow raincoat moves from standing on the chest to hiding under the bed, activating a light with their right hand as they move underneath, illuminating the floor beneath the bed frame.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot filmed at the subject's level, a small figure in a yellow raincoat is positioned in the center-left middle ground, standing on a wooden chest. To the right of the figure, a metal-frame bed occupies the center middle ground, with a tall wooden crate to its right. A bucket is visible in the bottom-left foreground. The figure, whose features are obscured by a hood, drops from the chest and moves to the right, going under the bed. As the figure moves beneath the bed, a light source held in its hand illuminates the floor, shifting the focal point of light to the area under the bed frame.",
