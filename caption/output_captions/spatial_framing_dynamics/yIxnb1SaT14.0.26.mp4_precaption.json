    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, captured from a low angle looking up at grand European architecture against a deep blue night sky. On the left, a curved stone building is warmly illuminated, highlighting its detailed facade, open shutters, and an ornate iron balcony. In the middleground, a taller, turreted structure stands mostly in silhouette, its dark form creating a sense of imposing scale, while a railway on an overpass is also situated in front of it. The deep blue sky serves as the background. There is no single main subject; instead, the composition emphasizes the majestic and atmospheric quality of the urban environment, using the interplay of light, shadow, and architectural forms to evoke a feeling of nocturnal grandeur.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A low-angle, nighttime shot looks up at three ornate buildings against a deep blue sky. On the left, the curved facade of a stone building is illuminated by a warm, yellow light, highlighting its blocky texture. This building features a window with a black, wrought-iron balcony and completely open yellow shutters. In the middle ground, a taller, darker building is visible, topped with a prominent domed turret, appearing mostly in silhouette. In front of it, a railway on an overpass is also in the middle ground. An overlay of white text is present in the bottom right corner, reading \"MATHIEU STANI\u0106\" above the word \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of an urban scenery at night, framed from a low angle looking up at the buildings. In the foreground, the curved facade of an illuminated stone building occupies the left side of the frame. Positioned in the middle ground are a tall, turreted building in the center-right and a railway overpass that extends from the bottom right. The deep blue night sky serves as the background, filling the top and right portions of the frame. A text overlay is situated in the foreground at the bottom right corner.",
