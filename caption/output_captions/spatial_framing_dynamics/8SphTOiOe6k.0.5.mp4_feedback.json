    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a bustling street scene. In the foreground, a man in a dark suit with a white mask and backpack stands on the right side of the frame, while a woman in a beige coat is positioned slightly to his left. Both are in the middle ground, with the camera at their height. As the camera moves forward, these subjects gradually exit the frame to the right. In the background, a group of people walks along the street, initially positioned centrally and then moving towards the right. The street is lined with traditional wooden buildings and trees with autumn foliage, extending into the background. A red 'Do Not Enter' sign is visible in the top right, and decorative umbrellas are propped against a fence on the right. The camera maintains a consistent height, providing a first-person perspective as it advances down the street.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a bustling street scene with several people and buildings. A man in a dark suit, wearing a white mask and carrying a backpack, stands on the sidewalk, while a woman with long hair, wearing a beige coat, is nearby. As the camera moves forward, both the masked man and the woman gradually exit the frame. In the distance, a group of people walks along the street, though their clothing is not clearly visible, making it difficult to determine if they are wearing school uniforms. The buildings lining the street feature traditional architectural elements, and trees with autumn foliage add to the scene, depicting a typical day with people going about their activities.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a view down a paved street in a Japanese town during the day. The road is lined with traditional wooden buildings, detached houses with small yards, and utility poles under a blue sky with white clouds. In the distance, a green mountain is visible. A red circular 'Do Not Enter' sign is posted on a pole. Several pedestrians walk along the sidewalk on the right, and decorative pink and purple umbrellas are propped against a dark fence.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
