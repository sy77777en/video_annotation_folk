    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a high-contrast, black-and-white, pixelated style, a middle-aged man with a beard and a shaved or balding head stands with an intense expression. He appears to be shirtless or is wearing a light-colored top. He holds a pistol with his right hand, aiming it forward and to his right. As he fires the weapon, a spray of white pixels erupts from the muzzle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stark, monochromatic scene rendered in a dithered, high-contrast style of black and white, a person stands within a confined indoor space. The setting appears to be a narrow corridor or room, with a panel of buttons or lights visible in the background. The individual raises a pistol and fires it, causing a stylized muzzle flash to erupt from the barrel as a burst of white lines and dots.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot of a man standing slightly left of center in the middle ground, framed by a dark structure in the left foreground. In the background, a panel with lights or buttons is visible. The man raises a pistol with his right hand, extending it toward the right side of the frame. As he aims, the shot transitions to a medium shot, tightening on his upper body. The pistol, now positioned on the right, fires, and a muzzle flash erupts into the right foreground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
