    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the shot starts inside a wooden tower, with a door frame in the left foreground and an orange supply box held in the bottom right foreground. Through the central doorway, a mountainous landscape is visible in the background. The camera moves forward and to the right, exiting the tower onto a wooden balcony. As it moves, the interior elements recede, and the shot pans right. The final framing shows the wooden balcony railing in the foreground, extending from the bottom left to the center, with the exterior of the tower on the right. The expansive, silhouetted forest and mountain range occupy the background. A text overlay is consistently positioned in the bottom left foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective inside a wooden fire lookout tower, a vast, mountainous landscape is visible at either sunrise or sunset. The scene is bathed in a warm, golden-yellow light, with layers of silhouetted mountains and dark coniferous trees seen from a wooden balcony with a railing. On an interior wall, an orange sign with the word \"PARADISE\" in black letters hangs to the left of a small, square picture of a raccoon. To the right is a red and white \"VOLUNTEER\" poster featuring a shield emblem with a tower silhouette. In the foreground, a portion of an orange supply box with a small, angled lid is held by dark straps.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moves from inside a wooden lookout tower out onto its surrounding balcony. The interior wall has an orange \"PARADISE\" sign, a small photo of a raccoon, and a red and white \"VOLUNTEER\" poster. The view from the wooden balcony reveals a vast, mountainous forest landscape under a hazy, golden sky at either sunrise or sunset. The scene is filled with silhouetted pine trees and layered mountain ranges fading into the distance. An orange container with its lid propped open is being picked up in the foreground of the lower right corner. Two overlays are present: a green banner with white text that reads \"#48\" and a light blue banner with white text that reads \"Firewatch | 2016.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
