    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, a person is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, sitting on the balcony of a house. The camera is positioned below the subject, creating a low-angle view. The scene is framed by out-of-focus, dark green foliage in the foreground, which occupies the bottom, left, and top portions of the frame. A large tree trunk is also visible in the foreground on the right, further enclosing the central subject and the house.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person sits on the wooden railing of a house's balcony, viewed from a low angle through dense green foliage. They are wearing a red jacket over a lighter-colored shirt, brown pants, and a beige bucket hat that obscures their hair. Their legs dangle over the side of the railing, and they gesture with their hands while looking out from the illuminated interior of the modern-style home. Another person in black and white clothing is visible behind him, moving around.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene depicts an outdoor setting in a lush, forested area during twilight. A modern house with large glass windows is nestled among tall trees and dense greenery. The house features warm, wooden interiors visible through the windows, illuminated by soft, hanging lights. The exterior is surrounded by vibrant green foliage, including ferns and leafy branches, creating a serene and secluded atmosphere. The sky is a deepening blue, indicating the transition from day to night. The overall composition highlights the contrast between the natural environment and the cozy, inviting interior of the house.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
