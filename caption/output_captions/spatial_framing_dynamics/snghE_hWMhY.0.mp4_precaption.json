    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A tall, slender rocket stands vertically in the center of the view against a black night sky. The rocket's main body is painted in sections of white and a light blue-green color, topped by a white nose cone. Several smaller, white solid rocket boosters are attached to the lower part of the main stage. Throughout the video, a steady plume of white vapor vents from the base of the stationary rocket.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A tall, slender rocket stands vertically on a launchpad against a black night sky. The rocket is primarily white with a greenish-blue section on its upper half and features a pointed nose cone. Bright spotlights from the ground and nearby towers illuminate the vehicle, while other lights are visible in the distant background. White vapor continuously vents from the base of the rocket, creating a small cloud that drifts in the darkness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a tall rocket stands vertically in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground against a dark background. Bright spotlights are visible in the middle ground to the left and right of the rocket, with additional, more distant lights in the background on the right. A dark structure is partially visible in the foreground at the bottom left. Throughout the shot, the rocket remains stationary while a plume of white vapor continuously vents from its base at the bottom center of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
