    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a group of several shirtless men standing in very dim, reddish lighting against a dark background. One man is positioned centrally and appears to be the main focus, standing upright and facing forward. The other shirtless men are gathered around him, their forms less distinct due to the low illumination and their positions within the group. The group seems to rotate counterclockwise, or alternatively, the camera might be panning clockwise around them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place in an extremely dark, undefined setting containing several shirtless individuals. Initially, the figures are dimly lit and difficult to distinguish within the deep shadows. Throughout the video, the lights dim and brighten intermittently, eventually casting a distinct red glow over the scene, making the forms slightly more visible against the pervasive darkness.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video shows likely a stage show of a few shirtless men dancing, with one of them standing in the center, drawing more attention. Initially, the light is off, revealing a black screen. When the lights are on, it shows a medium shot of the men.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a black screen. When the scene becomes visible, it presents a medium shot featuring several shirtless men. A central man stands upright in the middle ground, positioned in the center of the frame. Other men are grouped around him, occupying the foreground and middle ground, visible primarily in the lower left, lower right, and bottom areas of the frame against a dark, undefined background. The entire group appears to rotate counterclockwise, or the camera pans clockwise around them, causing the surrounding figures to shift their positions across the frame while the central man remains relatively centered. The lighting intensity fluctuates, dimming and brightening with a reddish hue. The camera is positioned at the same height as the subjects.",
