An animation begins in the center-left of the frame as a bright line traces a territory, which then fills with a light-colored overlay in the same center-left position. Text and a symbol appear on this overlay, while a label for \"GENEVA\" materializes slightly above it.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated sequence unfolds on a dark, textured map featuring faint grey lines and several lake-like shapes. A white line traces a territory around a central, crescent-shaped lake, which then fills with a light, parchment-colored texture. On this territory, the words \"LEAGUE OF NATIONS\" appear in a dark font above a blue, star-like symbol. A label with the word \"GENEVA\" in a black box points to a location on this territory. To the right, a rectangular graphic with tattered edges appears, depicting the Japanese flag, which consists of a red circle on a white background. A straight white line is then drawn, connecting the League of Nations territory to the Japanese flag graphic.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set against a dark, textured background resembling a chalkboard, which displays a monochromatic map with light gray lines representing rivers and larger shapes indicating lakes. An animation begins as a bright white line traces a path on the map. An overlay appears, highlighting a region in a light, parchment-like color. This overlay is labeled with the text \"LEAGUE OF NATIONS\" and features a blue star-like symbol. The city of \"GENEVA\" is also identified with an overlay of text and a dot. To the right, a second overlay materializes: a tattered, parchment-like rectangle showing the Japanese flag, which consists of a red circle on a white background. A solid white line is then drawn, connecting the League of Nations symbol to the Japanese flag overlay.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
