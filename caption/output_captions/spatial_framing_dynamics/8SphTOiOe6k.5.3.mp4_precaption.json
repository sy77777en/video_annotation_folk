    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a bustling street scene with various people walking along a pathway lined with shops. The individuals are diverse in appearance, wearing casual clothing such as jackets and sweaters, and all of them are wearing masks. Some are holding items like bags or drinks. The street is populated with both men and women, and the atmosphere suggests a lively, everyday setting. A few people are seen walking in pairs or small groups, indicating social interactions. The scene includes a mix of ages, with adults being the most prominent. The setting is urban, with visible elements like a vending machine and shop signs contributing to the commercial environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of a lively outdoor street scene in a quaint town setting. The environment features a paved walkway lined with traditional wooden buildings, some of which have signs and displays outside. The time of day is daytime, with a partly cloudy sky overhead. People are walking along the street, some wearing casual clothing and all people in masks, indicating a bustling yet relaxed atmosphere. Trees with autumn foliage add a touch of color to the scene, while a red vending machine and a scooter provide modern contrasts to the traditional architecture. The overall setting is vibrant and dynamic, with a mix of natural and human-made elements.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a bustling street scene, capturing a diverse group of people walking along a pathway lined with shops. The camera is positioned at the height of the subjects, providing a first-person perspective. In the foreground, individuals are seen walking from the bottom left to the center, while others move from the center to the right, indicating a flow of pedestrian traffic. The middle ground features more people walking in pairs or small groups, with some holding bags or drinks, positioned towards the center and right. The background includes traditional wooden buildings with shop signs, a red vending machine, and a scooter, located towards the right side of the frame. Trees with autumn foliage are visible on the left, adding color to the scene. The camera maintains a consistent height and angle throughout, capturing the dynamic and lively atmosphere of the urban setting.",
