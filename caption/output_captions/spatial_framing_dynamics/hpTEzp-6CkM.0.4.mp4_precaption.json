    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video centers on a man wearing a black T-shirt, black pants, black and white sneakers, and a dark grey and white duck-tongue hat, who is first shown leaping over a wooden and fabric sedan chair. This sedan chair holds a seated woman dressed in a reddish-white striped kimono and is supported by two bearers; one on the left wears a dark sleeveless top with cutouts and light blue shorts, and the other on the right is similarly attired. The camera then tracks the man in black as he runs forward along the street, where other individuals, some in traditional Japanese attire, are present. Three individuals in dark blue jackets, traditional Japanese attire, and light-colored shoes are chasing the man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene on a street within a traditional Japanese-style village. The paved street, showing cracks on its surface, is flanked by wooden buildings with tiled roofs. Some of these structures have purple awnings or accents and feature paper-screened windows. Beyond the village, green, tree-covered hills rise against an overcast sky. People, some in traditional clothing, are present in the background, and a palanquin-like structure is being transported. Wooden barrels are also visible along the street.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video opens with a wide shot of a bustling street, showing a man in black wearing a duck-tongue hat leaping over a woman seated on a sedan chair carried by two bearers. The camera then follows him as he runs forward along the street, maintaining the full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, featuring a man in black in the center foreground leaping over a sedan chair positioned in the center middle ground. This chair, holding a woman, is carried by two bearers, one in the left middle ground and the other in the right middle ground. Wooden buildings frame the scene on the left and right, stretching from the middle ground to the background, with hills in the distant background and an overcast sky at the top. The street extends from the foreground to the background. The camera, maintaining a full shot and positioned at the subject's level, then tracks the man as he lands in the center foreground and runs forward along the center of the street, moving towards the middle ground. As he advances, the sedan chair and bearers shift to the background. Other people, including three individuals in traditional attire, enter from the background and move into the middle ground, following him from the right and center of the street.",
