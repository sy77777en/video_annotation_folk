    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a landscape, with the composition focusing on the scenery. A flat, reddish-brown expanse of ground occupies the bottom of the frame in the foreground. The majority of the frame, from the middle ground to the background, is filled by a vast sky. A large, dark storm cloud system stretches horizontally across the middle of the frame, positioned above the low horizon. Above this dark formation, lighter gray clouds fill the top portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at a low height and remains static, looking up at the sky. Throughout the shot, the clouds are in motion in a time-lapse effect; the dark, low-hanging cloud mass churns in the center, while the upper, lighter parts of the formation move upwards and shift across the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific main subject. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky filled with a massive, low-hanging storm cloud system. These dark, ominous clouds form a distinct shelf-like structure that stretches across the horizon, contrasting with the lighter gray sky above. Below, a flat, reddish-brown expanse of earth provides a stark, empty foreground that accentuates the sheer size and power of the weather formation, making the storm itself the central element of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a wide, open outdoor landscape with a flat, reddish-brown ground stretching across the bottom of the scene. Above, the sky is filled with large, dense storm clouds in varying shades of gray and blue, with some areas appearing darker and more turbulent. The clouds move and shift, creating a sense of changing weather, while the horizon remains low and uninterrupted, emphasizing the vastness of the sky. There are no visible structures, vegetation, or people, and the lighting suggests late afternoon or early evening as the clouds obscure direct sunlight. No overlays or additional visual elements are present.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
