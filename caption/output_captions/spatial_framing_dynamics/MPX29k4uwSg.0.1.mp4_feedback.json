    "pre_caption": "This is a static close-up shot focusing on the lower portion of a weathered wooden fence post, which occupies the foreground on the left side of the frame. Barbed wire is wrapped around the post, and a loose strand hangs in the center-left foreground. Snow covers the bottom of the frame, with a few stalks of dry grass visible at the bottom left near the post's base. In the out-of-focus background, a snow-covered barn is situated in the upper-center-right, with faint silhouettes of trees visible in the distant background on both the far left and right sides. The camera is positioned at a low angle, level with the snow at the base of the post, and remains completely still throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a snowy landscape, a weathered wooden fence post stands in the foreground on the left. The post, shown from its lower section, is constructed from several dark gray, textured wooden poles with distinct grain patterns, bound together by wraps of barbed wire. A loose strand of barbed wire hangs in a semi-circular shape in front of it. Snow is piled around the base of the post, with a few stalks of dry, brown grass poking through. In the out-of-focus background, a dark wooden barn with a snow-covered roof is visible, flanked by distant, bare trees.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stark winter landscape, a weathered gray wooden fence post wrapped in barbed wire stands in the foreground, partially buried in deep snow. A single strand of wire hangs in a loose loop beside it, with some dry, brown grass visible at the base of the post. Beyond the fence, a vast, white, snow-covered field stretches towards the horizon under an overcast sky. In the blurred distance, a dark, rustic barn with a snow-dusted roof is visible, flanked by the faint silhouettes of bare trees.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video showcases a snowy landscape with a wooden post in the foreground, positioned on the left side of the frame, and a snow-covered house and trees out of focus in the background on the right. Only the lower part of the wooden post is visible.",
