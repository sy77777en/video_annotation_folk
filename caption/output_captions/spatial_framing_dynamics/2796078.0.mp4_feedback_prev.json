    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a woman holding a fluffy dog, capturing them from the waist up. Initially, the woman and dog are centered in the frame, with the woman facing away from the camera. They occupy the foreground, while the background features a modern building with large glass windows and two men standing near it. As the video progresses, the camera pans slightly to the left, keeping the woman and dog in the center but shifting the background to include more of the outdoor seating area with wooden and metal furniture. The woman turns her head to the right, revealing her profile, while the dog remains in her arms. The camera maintains its position at the subject's level throughout, ensuring a consistent perspective. The greenery and potted plants remain in the background, enhancing the outdoor setting. The transition between initial and final frames is smooth, with the primary focus remaining on the woman and dog as they move slightly within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with curly brown hair, wearing a beige coat, holding a fluffy, light brown dog. The dog is wearing a blue and white bandana with small patterns around its neck. The woman is seen from different angles, with her hair partially tied back. The setting includes outdoor seating and greenery, suggesting a casual, outdoor environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The camera showcases an outdoor urban setting. It initially focuses on a modern building with large glass windows, where two men are standing outside. As it trucks left, the scene transitions naturally to another modern building, likely a caf\u00e9 or social space, also featuring large glass windows that reveal people inside. The exterior includes wooden and metal furniture, such as tables and chairs, arranged on a paved surface. The scene is lively, with people casually interacting in the background. A notable visual element is a person holding a fluffy, curly-haired dog adorned with a blue bandana, adding a touch of warmth and companionship to the scene. The setting is enhanced by greenery, including potted plants and trees, contributing to a relaxed and inviting atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
