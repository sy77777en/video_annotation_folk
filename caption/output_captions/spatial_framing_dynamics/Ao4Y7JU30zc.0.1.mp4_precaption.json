    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man is shown in a dark, heavily silhouetted profile shot. A bright light source from behind and to the left illuminates the outline of his head, shoulders, and hands, while the rest of his form is cast in deep shadow. His head is bowed forward, and his hands are clasped together in front of his mouth. Due to the dramatic lighting, his facial features, expression, and clothing are not visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, the silhouette of a person is captured in profile. A soft light source, positioned off-camera to the left, outlines their form, casting their features and the majority of the room into deep shadow. The person's hands are held together near their mouth. The background is indistinct and out of focus, suggesting the interior of a room.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static close-up shot, the silhouette of a man is positioned in the right foreground, his profile facing left. A strong light source from the top-left background illuminates the outline of his head and hands, which are clasped in front of his mouth. The rest of his form and the background are in deep shadow, with an out-of-focus vertical structure faintly visible in the middle ground on the left. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
