    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a sweeping aerial cityscape scenery shot, capturing the vibrant energy of a dense urban environment at night. The high-angle perspective looks down upon a complex network of streets and Haussmann-style buildings, their windows glowing like scattered embers in the darkness. Long-exposure photography transforms the moving traffic into brilliant streaks of white and red light, which flow along the roads, creating a dynamic tapestry of motion. The focus is not on any individual element but on the sprawling scale and dynamic atmosphere of the city itself, conveyed through the intricate patterns of architecture and the mesmerizing flow of artificial light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, objective viewpoint, the scene captures a dense European city at night. The streets are lined with multi-story buildings, many with dark facades punctuated by glowing yellow windows. A major thoroughfare, illuminated by streetlights, cuts diagonally across the view, with traffic creating long, white and red light trails. At a busy intersection, storefronts cast a bright glow, and one building features a prominent vertical red neon sign. In the bottom right corner, an overlay watermark reads \"MATHIEU STANI\u0106\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" written below it.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static extreme wide shot of a city at night, captured from a high-angle aerial perspective. The scene is densely filled with buildings that extend from the foreground at the bottom of the frame to the background at the top. A main street runs diagonally from the bottom left towards the upper right, intersecting with another street in the lower-left quadrant. Light trails from traffic are visible along these streets, primarily in the foreground and middle ground. A watermark is overlaid in the foreground at the bottom right corner. The camera remains stationary throughout the shot.",
