    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up shot reveals a beige and grey corkboard surface. A red, twisted string is stretched across the scene, initially out of focus. As the camera's focus shifts, the red string becomes partially clear, along with a small, white piece of paper positioned beneath it. On the paper, the word \"UNCLE JERRY\" is printed in black, capital letters. The white piece of paper is pinned by a red thumbtack, with many red strings connected to this thumbtack and radiating in all directions. Additionally, there is another red piece of paper beneath the strings to the right of the white piece.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a close-up shot, a thin, red, twisted string is stretched across a corkboard, initially out of focus. As the camera's focus shifts, the red string becomes partially clear, along with a small, white piece of paper positioned beneath it. On the paper, the word \"UNCLE JERRY\" is printed in black, capital letters. The white piece of paper is pinned by a red thumbtack, with many red strings connected to this thumbtack and radiating in all directions. Additionally, there is another red piece of paper beneath the strings to the right of the white piece. In the second part of the video, the center-upper background is heavily blurred, suggesting a rolled-up document or map. An overlay in the bottom left displays the text \"[4]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot begins with the focus on a marbled surface in the foreground. A blurry red string extends from the bottom right towards the top left, positioned over a blurry white paper in the center-left middle ground and a red thumbtack in the center-right middle ground. The camera's focus then shifts from the foreground to the middle ground, bringing the second subject into clarity. The shot resolves into a close-up of the white paper, now clearly labeled \"UNCLE JERRY,\" and the red thumbtack pinning it down. The red string is now in focus, while the marbled surface in the foreground becomes blurred. The camera remains stationary at a low angle, level with the subjects, throughout the shot.",
