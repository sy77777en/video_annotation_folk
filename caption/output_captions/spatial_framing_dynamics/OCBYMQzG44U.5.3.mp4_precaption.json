    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a surreal, liminal space resembling an endless, sterile pool hallway. The focus is on the unsettling atmosphere and bizarre environment rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of unease and mystery. The scene is a long, narrow corridor with walls, a ceiling, and a narrow walkway all covered in small, white, square tiles. Alongside the walkway runs a channel of dark, murky water, separated by a simple metal railing. The space is illuminated by bright, hazy light from recessed rectangular fixtures on the walls, casting a low-saturation bright light, predominantly white with a subtle hint of green, over everything. At the far end of the corridor, a single, large, yellow rubber duck sits in a brightly lit alcove, serving as a strange and incongruous focal point in the otherwise empty and monotonous environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person POV, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, the perspective moves down a long, narrow, and sterile corridor. The walls, walkway, and ceiling are uniformly covered in small, white square tiles, illuminated by recessed rectangular lights that create a bright, hazy atmosphere. To the left of the tiled walkway, a metal railing runs alongside a channel of dark, still water. At the far end of the corridor, both the tunnel and the dark water turn left, leading into another shadowed, dark tunnel. A large, classic yellow rubber duck is positioned under a single, small light at the turning point.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, eye-level, first-person perspective shot of a long, tiled corridor. Initially, a narrow walkway occupies the right and bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground into the distance. To the left, a metal railing in the middle ground separates the walkway from a channel of dark water. In the center background, a large yellow rubber duck is positioned at the far end of the corridor. The camera moves steadily forward along the walkway, causing the duck to grow larger and transition from the background to the middle ground, becoming the central focal point as the end of the corridor approaches.",
