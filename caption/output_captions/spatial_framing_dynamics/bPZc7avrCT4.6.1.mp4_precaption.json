    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An older woman with short, white hair and fair skin, wearing a white t-shirt with a prominent red and blue American flag design, stands on the left. She is holding a green, somewhat deflated, pliable object resembling a water-filled balloon, which she then pushes towards the head of a younger man standing to her right. The man has short brown hair, a brown beard, and fair skin. He is wearing a red t-shirt with a graphic depicting a truck with an American flag design and the word \"USA\" above it. He stands with his hands on his hips, facing forward with a neutral expression, and closes his eyes as the green object makes contact with the side of his head and deforms.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a sunny day, with a dense line of tall, green trees and a mowed green lawn forming the background. The sky is not visible. Two individuals are present; one, an older person with white hair, wears a white t-shirt with a red and blue American flag design and holds a green, oblong water balloon. The other, a younger person with short brown hair, wears a red t-shirt featuring a graphic of a truck with the American flag integrated into its design and the word \"USA\" in large letters. The water balloon is shown in slow motion, deforming as it makes contact with the younger person's head.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a medium shot, with an older woman positioned in the left-middle ground and a younger man in the right-middle ground. A green lawn occupies the foreground and middle ground, while a dense line of trees forms the background across the width of the frame. The woman, initially holding a green object, extends her arms, moving the object from the left towards the right side of the younger man's head, where it makes contact and deforms. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the action.",
