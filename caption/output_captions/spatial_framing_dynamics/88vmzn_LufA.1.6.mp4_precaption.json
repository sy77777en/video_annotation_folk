    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a sleek, black vehicle with a glossy finish, prominently displaying advanced technology on its roof. The roof is equipped with two distinct cylindrical devices: one is a taller, slender cylinder, and the other is a shorter, dome-shaped structure. These devices are likely sensors or communication equipment. The vehicle is shown on a road, and a translucent blue circular wave emanates from the roof, suggesting the activation of a radar or sensor system. The vehicle's design is modern, with smooth lines and a streamlined shape, emphasizing its technological sophistication.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an overhead view of the roof of a black vehicle driving on a paved road with white painted lines, resembling a crosswalk. The vehicle's roof is glossy black and reflects sunlight. Mounted on the roof are several black communication devices: two taller, thin rod-like antennas and two shorter, dome-shaped units on square bases. Translucent, animated blue rings emanate outwards from the rod antennas, expanding across the roof during the video. The scene occurs during daylight hours under clear conditions, and the road appears blurred due to the vehicle's movement.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video commences with a medium shot, focusing on the rear section of the black vehicle's roof, positioned centrally within the frame. A tall antenna is prominent in the center-left foreground, with a dome-shaped device situated slightly behind it in the center-right middle ground. Another tall antenna is partially visible in the top right middle ground. A translucent blue ring emanates from the foreground antenna. The shot then transitions smoothly outwards to a full shot, revealing the entire roof of the vehicle, which remains centered. In this wider view, two tall antennas are visible in the left and right middle ground, respectively, accompanied by two dome devices located slightly more centrally, also in the middle ground. The blue rings now emanate from both tall antennas, expanding across the roof surface. Throughout the sequence, the camera is positioned directly above the vehicle.",
