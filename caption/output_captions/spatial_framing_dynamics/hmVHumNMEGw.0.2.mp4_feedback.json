    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a man positioned in the center foreground, framed by green bushes and small trees in the foreground and middle ground on the left and right. In the background, reddish-brown buildings are visible at the top of the frame. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, then pulls back smoothly, transitioning into a full shot. In the final framing, the man remains in the center of the composition, now fully visible in the middle ground, which reveals more of the surrounding garden and its pathways.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young Black man with bleached blonde, close-cropped hair looking directly forward with a serious expression. He is wearing a black t-shirt with large, white capital letters, of which \"INK\" and \"RE\" are partially visible. A pink, unzipped jacket is draped over his shoulders, and he has small hoop earrings in both earlobes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in an outdoor, landscaped garden during the daytime under an overcast sky. In the background, distinctive reddish-brown, terraced apartment buildings are visible. The middle ground features a mix of green bushes and small, manicured trees, including some that resemble bonsai in planters. A person with short, bleached-blonde hair stands in the center of the composition, wearing a black t-shirt and a pink jacket draped over their shoulders, looking directly forward.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
