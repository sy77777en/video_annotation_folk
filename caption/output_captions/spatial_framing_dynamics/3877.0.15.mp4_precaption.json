    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a rugged mountain landscape with a prominent rocky cliff. At the top of the cliff, a person stands, wearing outdoor clothing suitable for hiking, including a jacket and pants, with a neutral color palette. Below, three individuals are climbing the rock face. The climber in the middle is wearing gray clothing. The climbers are positioned vertically along the cliff, showcasing their ascent. The scene emphasizes the adventurous nature of the subjects, highlighting their engagement with the challenging terrain.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, filmed by a drone, captures a dramatic outdoor scene featuring a rugged mountain landscape. The setting is a rocky cliff with jagged edges, overlooking a vast expanse of distant mountains and a serene body of water below. The time of day appears to be overcast, with a sky filled with clouds casting a muted light over the scene. The cliff is composed of dark, textured rock, with one individual standing on the cliff and three others forming a vertical human chain at the edge, adding a sense of scale to the towering formation. The video includes overlay elements, such as a prominent logo and text in the center, reading \"macpac\" and \"weather anything,\" which are not part of the natural scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot. The Macpac logo and the text \"macpac\" are overlaid in the center of the frame, appearing in the foreground relative to the landscape. A large rocky cliff occupies the right side of the frame in the middle ground. Four people are positioned on this cliff on the right: one person stands at the top right, while three others are climbing vertically below them. These subjects are in the middle ground. A body of water is visible in the bottom left and center-left in the middle ground, with distant mountains filling the background across the top and left portions of the frame. Shortly after the video begins, the text \"weather anything\" fades in below the \"macpac\" text in the central overlay. The camera remains static and is positioned level with the subjects on the cliff.",
