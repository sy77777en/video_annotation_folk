    "pre_caption": "The video showcases an abstract scene where vibrant pink and blue colors swirl and intertwine in a fluid motion. These colors occupy the entire frame, with no distinct boundaries between foreground, middle ground, and background. Initially, the pink and blue hues are concentrated towards the top center of the frame, with droplets and tendrils extending downwards. As the video progresses, the colors gradually spread outwards, moving from the top center towards the edges of the frame. The pink and blue elements maintain a central presence throughout, with some droplets drifting towards the bottom left and right corners. The camera remains stationary, capturing the dynamic interplay of colors as they blend and separate, creating a continuous sense of movement and transformation. The dark background provides a stark contrast, enhancing the vividness of the colors and emphasizing their fluid motion. There are no changes in the camera's height relative to the subject, as the focus remains on the abstract interplay of colors within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a dynamic and abstract display of vibrant colors, primarily pink and blue, swirling and intertwining in a fluid motion. The colors appear to be suspended in a liquid medium, creating a mesmerizing effect with droplets and tendrils extending in various directions. The pink and blue hues blend and contrast against each other, forming intricate patterns and textures that suggest a sense of movement and flow. The overall composition is visually striking, with the colors creating a captivating and artistic visual experience.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an abstract scene with vibrant colors swirling in a dark environment. Bright pink and cyan hues blend and intertwine, creating a dynamic and fluid motion. The colors appear to be suspended in a liquid medium, forming intricate, cloud-like shapes with a smooth texture. Droplets and wisps of color drift and merge, adding a sense of movement and transformation. The dark background enhances the vividness of the colors, making them stand out prominently. The overall effect is a mesmerizing display of color and form, with no discernible setting or time of day, focusing purely on the visual interplay of the elements.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
