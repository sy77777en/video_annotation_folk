    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a fixed point-of-view shot from a light blue and silver open-wheel formula-style race car. The car's bodywork features a white \"GoPro\" logo in front of the open cockpit, and its black wheels and front suspension are visible on either side. Inside the cockpit, a driver is seated, seen from behind. They are wearing a black helmet, a white racing suit, and black and white gloves, with red and black wristbands tied around their arms outside the suit. Their hands are gripping the steering wheel. In the distance ahead on the track, a bright green race car and another, more distant dark-colored car are also visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on a light blue, open-wheel race car shows the vehicle speeding along a paved racetrack. The track curves to the right, bordered by a dirt shoulder and an expansive plain with green grass, while green, rolling hills are visible in the far distance under an overcast sky. In the distance, other race cars, including a bright green one, can be seen ahead on the course. The front of the blue car, featuring a white \"GoPro\" logo, and the driver's hands on the steering wheel inside the cockpit are visible in the foreground.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a wide shot of a suburban road. The camera is fixed just above and behind a racing driver's head, capturing the car moving forward. The shot only shows the front half of the vehicle, the top of the driver's head, and part of their body; the rest of the frame consists of a road flanked by grass on both sides and sky.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, fixed point-of-view shot from a camera positioned just above and behind a racing driver's head. The front half of the light blue race car and the driver's helmet and hands occupy the bottom half of the frame in the foreground. The paved racetrack extends from the foreground into the middle ground, curving to the right. In the middle ground, a green race car is positioned slightly to the right of center, with another dark car visible further in the background. The track is flanked by green grass in the middle ground, while rolling hills and an overcast sky occupy the background and the top of the frame. As the car moves forward, the track and surrounding landscape rush toward the camera and flow outward from the center, while the POV car remains stationary within the frame.",
