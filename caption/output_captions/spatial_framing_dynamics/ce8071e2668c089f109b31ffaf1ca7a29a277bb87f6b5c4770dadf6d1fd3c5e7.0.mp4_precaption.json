    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Three men stand together on a sand dune. The man on the left wears a blue short-sleeved shirt and yellow shorts. The man in the center is dressed in a dark green long-sleeved shirt and red shorts. The man on the right wears a dark long-sleeved top, dark pants, and a light-colored head covering.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a wide, static view of the Wadi Rum desert in Jordan during the day. In the foreground, a large dune of fine, reddish-orange sand slopes downward, its crest marked by the footprints of three people standing near the top. Their long shadows are cast across the smooth surface of the sand. In the background, a vast expanse of rugged, layered sandstone mountains and cliffs rises under a pale blue, hazy sky, creating a dramatic and expansive landscape.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static extreme wide shot, three men are positioned as a group slightly left of center in the middle ground, standing on the crest of a large, red sand dune. This dune dominates the foreground and middle ground, sloping down from the upper left towards the bottom of the frame. In the background, a vast range of rugged, layered mountains extends across the scene, with a hazy sky visible at the top. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
