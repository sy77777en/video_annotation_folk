    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a close-up, rear view of a light-skinned person's entire thighs. This person is wearing a dark grey t-shirt and what appears to be light-colored underwear, with their hairy legs visible. In the mid-ground, another person is seen walking away, wearing a white, long-sleeved garment and holding a transparent umbrella with a black edge over their head.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors in a rural, grassy landscape on an overcast and foggy day. In the foreground on the right, the lower body of a person wearing a dark shirt is visible, standing near a large, round, grey stone. The area is covered in tall, green grass. In the hazy distance, a second person in a white garment walks away from the camera, holding a dark umbrella. A low stone wall and a wooden gate can be seen in the background. The overall color palette is desaturated and cool.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot where the back of a person's thighs and lower torso occupy the right foreground. A large, round stone is positioned in the foreground to their left, near the bottom center. In the out-of-focus background, a second person is seen in the upper left, walking away from the camera. The middle ground is filled with tall grass, with a low wall and gate visible in the background behind the second person. The camera is initially positioned at the first subject's thigh level. The shot then becomes a wide shot focused on the second subject, with the camera remaining at that subject's level.",
