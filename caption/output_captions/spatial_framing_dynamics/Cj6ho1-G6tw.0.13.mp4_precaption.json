    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the foreground of a harvested field, a large, cylindrical hay bale made of golden straw rests on the right side. In the midground, a white camper van with a raised roof section is already in motion, driving from the left past a tall, leafy green tree, and continues to move from left to right along a road, eventually moving completely out of the scene on the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a rural landscape under a partly cloudy sky, a large, round, golden hay bale rests in the foreground of a harvested field covered in dry stubble. In the mid-ground, a white campervan drives from left to right along a road that borders the field, passing a lone, leafy green tree. As the camera ascends, a line of dark green hedges and distant fields becomes visible, stretching across the horizon with a faint view of a body of water in the far background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot opens on a rural landscape with a large, round hay bale in the right foreground. In the left middle ground, a white camper van is initially positioned next to a tree. The van drives horizontally from left to right along a road in the middle ground, eventually disappearing from view as it exits the frame on the right. The camera remains static at a level height, keeping the harvested field and the hay bale in the foreground and the distant tree line in the background for the duration of the shot.",
