    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures an urban cityscape, featuring a street intersection with traffic lights, crosswalks, and surrounding buildings. It highlights the urban atmosphere and layout, showcasing the interaction between natural and urban elements. Trees with sparse foliage line the street, and a few vehicles contribute to the dynamic city setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor urban intersection during the day, featuring a crosswalk and traffic lights. The setting includes a mix of natural and architectural elements, with trees lining the street and buildings in the background. The sky is overcast, casting a muted light over the scene. Vehicles, including several cars, are visible on the road, indicating light traffic. A few pedestrians are present, adding to the scene's dynamic. The environment is clean and organized, with clear road markings and pedestrian pathways. The scene maintains a neutral color palette, with the gray of the pavement contrasting against the greenery of the trees and the brick and concrete of the buildings.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban intersection, capturing a broad view of the scene. The crosswalks occupy the foreground, positioned centrally and extending towards the bottom of the frame. Traffic lights are located in the top left and top right areas, slightly elevated in the middle ground. Trees with sparse foliage line the left side of the frame, situated in the middle ground, while buildings appear in the background on the right side. Vehicles are scattered across the middle ground, moving horizontally from left to right. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective at eye level relative to the crosswalk and street. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning, preserving a stable and comprehensive view of the intersection and its surroundings.",
