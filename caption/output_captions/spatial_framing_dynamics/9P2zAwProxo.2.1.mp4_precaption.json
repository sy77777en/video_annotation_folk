    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with a short beard and mustache is shown on a snowy slope. He is dressed in winter ski attire, including a black and white jacket, black pants, and black gloves. He wears a black helmet, and his dark-lensed ski goggles cover his eyes. He is looking directly at the camera, which he appears to be holding on a pole, capturing a selfie-style video. His body is angled forward as he moves on skis or a snowboard.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a selfie POV shot where the camera is held by the person being filmed, a skier descends a wide, snow-covered slope at a ski resort. The scene takes place during the daytime under a bright, overcast sky. The run is bordered by a forest of bare, leafless trees on both sides, with a safety fence running along the edge on the left side. In the background, the structures of ski lifts and poles can be seen further up the mountain, creating a sense of depth on the expansive slope.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a man in ski gear is positioned in the center-left foreground, holding the camera at his level for a selfie-style perspective. He remains relatively static within the frame as he moves down a wide, snow-covered slope that extends from the foreground into the background. On the right, a line of bare trees occupies the middle ground and background. To the left, a safety fence is visible in the middle ground, with additional trees and ski lift structures situated in the background. As the man and camera move forward together, the background scenery recedes and shifts past him.",
