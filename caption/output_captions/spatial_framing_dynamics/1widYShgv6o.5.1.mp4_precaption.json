    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the size of the subject in the video. If it\u2019s not clear, describe how much of the subject is visible.\n\nNext, describe the **subjects and elements\u2019 spatial position in the video**. Indicate their approximate 2D position within the frame, such as **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, centre**. Describe their 3D position within the frame, such as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Try to analyze as many elements as you can see. Each time you mention an element, you need to explain its 2D and 3D position in the frame.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end of  this text. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes within the frame, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.  \n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scene in this video but do not capture their spatial framing and dynamics. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on it completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and dynamics in this video. The given caption is only to help you learn the video thoroughly, so don't rely on it too much. Focus on the Spatial framing and dynamics and don\u2019t write too much about the subject appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a track and field event with multiple athletes running on a curved track. In the foreground, there are several men in athletic gear. The man on the right is wearing a blue uniform and is running ahead of the others. To his left, there are three other men in white, blue, and black uniforms, who are significantly further behind. In the background, there are spectators seated in a stadium, with some sections filled and others sparse. The track is marked with white lines, and there are multiple signboards along the sides, including a visible \"SEIKO\" sign. The setting is a large indoor stadium with bright lighting and colorful banners hanging from the walls.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor athletic stadium during a track event, likely a championship, as indicated by the signage. The large, modern arena features tiered seating filled with spectators. The track is a standard red running surface with marked lanes. Athletes are in motion, running along the track, with officials and equipment positioned towards the center of the stadium. The environment is vibrant, with colorful banners and digital screens displaying event information, contributing to the dynamic atmosphere of the competition.**\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a track and field event in an indoor stadium. In the foreground, athletes are running on a curved track. Initially, a man in a blue uniform is positioned on the right, running ahead of others. To his left, three other athletes in white, blue, and black uniforms are further behind. As the video progresses, the athletes move from the right to the left of the frame, maintaining their positions relative to each other. The track, marked with white lines, curves from the bottom right to the top left. In the background, spectators fill the tiered seating, with some sections more populated than others. The stadium features bright lighting, colorful banners, and digital screens displaying event information. Signboards, including a prominent \"SEIKO\" sign, line the track. The camera remains at the athletes' level throughout, capturing the dynamic movement and vibrant atmosphere of the competition.",
