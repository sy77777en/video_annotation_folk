An introductory paragraph is located in the top-center of the screen, with various lists of hyperlinked categories occupying the middle and bottom portions of the frame. A slow, continuous zoom-in begins, centering on the introductory paragraph.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a static, full-screen view of an early version of the Wikipedia homepage from July 2001. The webpage features a minimalist design with a light gray, subtly patterned background. The text is primarily black, with all hyperlinks rendered in blue and underlined. A prominent blue \"[Home]\" link is situated in the upper right corner. The main body of the page contains an introductory paragraph describing Wikipedia as a collaborative encyclopedia project with over 6,000 articles. Below this, the page is structured with lists of hyperlinks organized into categories like \"Mathematics, and Natural Science,\" \"Social Sciences,\" and \"Arts and Sciences,\" linking to various academic subjects. Another section provides links to different language versions of the site, such as German, French, and Japanese. The bottom of the page includes administrative and community links, including \"Help desk\" and \"Bug reports.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A slow zoom-in reveals a computer screen displaying an early version of the Wikipedia homepage. The website features a minimalist, text-heavy design on a light gray background with a subtle grid pattern. The content is primarily black text with blue hyperlinks. In the top right corner, \"[Home]\" is displayed in blue text. A paragraph of text explains that the collaborative encyclopedia project started in January 2001, already has over 6,000 articles, and is covered by the GNU Free Documentation License. Below this are lists of hyperlinked categories, including \"Mathematics, and Natural Science,\" \"Social Sciences,\" and \"Arts and Sciences.\" A timestamp at the bottom of the page reads, \"July 27[], 2001, servertime (Pacific Standard Time).\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
