    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a cityscape scene featuring a broad view of an urban park area dominated by a tall, intricately designed monument with tiered architecture and dark stonework, set against a dramatic sky with scattered clouds. A row of national flags lines the edge of a manicured lawn, adjacent to a red brick-paved sidewalk. Separating the sidewalk from the square is a broad asphalt road, bustling with diverse vehicles including cars, motorcycles, and bicycles. Modern buildings are visible in the background, all contributing to a sense of scale and atmosphere, emphasizing the grandeur and ambiance of the location rather than highlighting any individual object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene captures the Independence Monument in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, under a sky filled with dark, heavy clouds. The tall, dark, lotus-shaped stone monument stands in the center of a circular plaza, with a single flagpole displaying the Cambodian flag. Across the road from the monument, a row of flagpoles is positioned at the edge of the park lawn. A wide asphalt road, bustling with cars, motorcycles, bicycles, and other vehicles, separates the red brick sidewalk from the plaza. A paved walkway extends from the foreground toward the monument, bordered by a green lawn on the right and trees on the left. In the background, modern city buildings rise against the overcast sky. A person is seen walking along the path.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of a city park and monument, captured from an eye-level perspective. A paved walkway begins in the bottom center foreground and recedes into the middle ground, leading toward a large monument located in the center middle ground. A person walks away from the camera along the left side of this walkway in the foreground. To the left of the path are trees in the foreground and middle ground, while a green lawn with a row of flags occupies the right foreground and middle ground. A road with traffic crosses the middle ground, and modern buildings are visible in the background behind the monument.",
