    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a shaved head is seen in silhouette, sitting alone on a bench in what appears to be a dark, hazy locker room. He is wearing a dark, long-sleeved hooded sweatshirt, dark pants, and dark sneakers. Leaning forward with his elbows resting on his knees and his hands clasped, he keeps his head bowed in a contemplative posture. He slowly rubs his hands together and at one point briefly brings both hands close to his mouth. The scene is lit dramatically from one side, casting a long shadow on the wall behind him and obscuring his facial features.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit and hazy locker room, a silhouetted figure sits on a simple bench against a stark wall. A single light source from above and to the left creates a strong backlight, casting a prominent shadow. Above the bench, a row of empty clothes hangers is mounted on the wall next to a sign that reads, \"BUDE RFC CORNWALL & DEVON CHAMPIONS 2016.\" The room features a plain concrete floor and unadorned walls.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A man is captured in a full shot, positioned in the center-right middle ground of a dimly lit room. He is seated on a bench that extends along the wall in the background. A dark, out-of-focus object in the left foreground partially obscures the view. In the background, a sign and a row of clothes hangers are mounted on the wall behind the man, with a doorway visible on the far left. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
