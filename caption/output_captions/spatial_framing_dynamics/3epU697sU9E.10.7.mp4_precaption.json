    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a photograph of a man and a woman walking away from the camera down the aisle of an airplane. The man, on the left, has short, light-colored hair and is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved collared shirt and dark trousers, with his right arm around the woman's shoulders. The woman, on the right, has short, curly, light-colored hair and is wearing a dark, long-sleeved top and dark pants, with her left arm around the man's waist. The airplane cabin features a long, light-colored, tufted couch along the windows on the right. The photograph is presented within a gray, box-like frame, and its bottom right corner appears curled up.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within the narrow corridor of an airplane. Along the right side, a long, beige, tufted sofa sits beneath a row of windows, with a wooden side table holding a telephone at its end. A wooden handrail lines the opposite wall. This entire view is presented as a photograph displayed inside a grey, three-dimensional frame, which is situated in a dark, undefined space. The bottom right corner of the photograph appears curled, revealing a pattern resembling a keyboard underneath.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video showcases a full shot of a frame-like object displaying a photograph of two people\u2019s backs in an airplane cabin setting, fully visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a full shot of a gray, frame-like object positioned in the center of the screen and the middle ground. The frame displays a photograph of two people, a man on the left and a woman on the right, walking away from the camera down the central aisle of an airplane cabin, moving from the middle ground toward the background of the photographic scene. Within the photograph, a long couch occupies the right side, while a handrail runs along the left wall, both creating lines that recede into the background. A side table is visible in the bottom right foreground of the photograph. The bottom right corner of the photograph itself is curled upwards, revealing a keyboard-like pattern underneath. The central frame is flanked by two vertical gray structures in the foreground, one on the far left and one on the far right, all set against a dark, undefined background. The camera remains static and is positioned at the level of the subjects in the photograph.",
