    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a single human subject, a person seated at a desk in a minimalist, tiled room. The person is wearing a light blue outfit and is focused on a computer screen in front of them. The desk is equipped with a monitor, and there are shelves and storage units on the walls. The person appears to be engaged in work or study, maintaining a consistent posture throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases a simulated office environment with a minimalist design. The room features a tiled floor and neutral-colored walls. Two desks are positioned against the walls, one of them equipped with two computer monitors and a chair. Two bookshelves provide ample storage space. The spotlight effectively illuminates most of the room, while areas beyond remain dark and out of view. Added text is present in the lower left corner, indicating additional information not part of the physical scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a minimalist office environment, capturing the entire room and its contents. The human subject, seated at a desk in the center-right of the frame, occupies the middle ground. Positioned slightly towards the back of the room, the person is seen from an overhead perspective, with the camera situated above them. The desk, equipped with a computer monitor, is located in the foreground-right, while another desk with dual monitors and a chair is placed in the background-left. Two bookshelves line the walls, one on the left side and the other near the subject, both in the middle ground. The tiled floor spans the entire scene, and the spotlight illuminates the central area, leaving the edges darker. Throughout the video, the subject remains stationary, maintaining a consistent posture focused on the computer. There are no noticeable changes in shot size, position, or camera movement, preserving the same spatial framing from start to finish. The added text in the lower left corner remains static, providing additional context without altering the visual composition.",
