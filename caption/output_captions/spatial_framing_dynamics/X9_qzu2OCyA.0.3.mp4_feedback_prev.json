    "pre_caption": "A full shot from a head-mounted camera perspective captures a skier positioned in the center foreground. The camera looks down, showing the skier's torso, legs, and skis, which are located at the bottom center of the frame. The wide, snowy slope occupies the middle ground and background, extending out from the skier's position to fill the entire view. As the skier glides forward, they remain centrally framed while their arms, initially extended to the sides, are brought in closer to their body. Due to the head-mounted camera, the perspective is consistently from above the skier's body, shifting slightly with the movement of their head.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a skier from a head-mounted camera perspective as they glide down a snowy slope. They are wearing a black ski helmet and large, blue-lensed ski goggles that obscure their eyes. A black neck gaiter is pulled up over their chin. Their outerwear is a red and grey varsity-style jacket with the white letters \"CU\" on the left chest, worn over black ski pants. On their hands are tan gloves, and they hold yellow ski poles. The skier is on red and black V\u00f6lkl skis, keeping their arms extended to the sides for balance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, mounted to a skier, captures a descent down a wide, groomed snow slope under a clear, bright blue sky. The perspective looks down past a pair of red and black skis, showing the white, tracked snow rushing by. The scene is set on a sunny day on a mountain, with a distinct shadow cast on the snow as the skier moves steadily downhill.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: This is a skiing video shot with a head-mounted camera. Due to the movement of the subject's head, the camera height shifts between being above the subject and at the same level as the subject.",
