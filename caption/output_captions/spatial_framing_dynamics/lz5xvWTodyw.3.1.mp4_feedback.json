    "pre_caption": "This is a first-person point-of-view tracking shot from the front of a moving vehicle. Initially, the colorful front of the vehicle occupies the center foreground, extending from the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, other train cars travel on tracks in the bottom left and center, flanked by tall skyscrapers on the left and right. A large white arrow is positioned in the top center, pointing down at the vehicle. As the shot progresses, the camera moves forward and ascends, transitioning to a high-angle aerial view. The cityscape, with its network of tracks and a body of water on the horizon, shifts from the middle ground to the background below. The tops of the skyscrapers, which initially towered over the vehicle, are now seen from above. Throughout the shot, UI elements remain fixed in the corners and bottom of the frame: a minimap and segment counter in the bottom left, a passenger counter in the bottom center, a gauge in the bottom right, and a location marker in the top right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a colorful, futuristic locomotive in an urban environment, captured through a dynamic tracking shot. The locomotive, adorned with vibrant hues of pink, blue, and yellow, is prominently positioned in the foreground, occupying about half of the frame's height. It is connected to multiple brightly colored train cars in motion. The camera begins above the second car of the moving train, ascending and moving forward to provide a high-angle view, though not directly overhead. This perspective reveals a sprawling cityscape with tall buildings, palm trees, and a network of train tracks. The detailed urban landscape, with various structures and roads, serves as a dynamic backdrop to the train's movement, with the locomotive and its cars as the main subjects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a dynamic scene in a stylized, futuristic city at sunset, viewed from a perspective above the second car of a moving vehicle. This vehicle, resembling an urban light rail or train with a vibrant, rainbow-colored exterior, appears to float as it travels through the air, with no visible tracks. The cityscape is bathed in a pink and purple glow from the setting sun, which is a bright orb on the horizon over a body of water. Below, numerous other multi-colored, segmented vehicles navigate a complex network of tracks, with palm trees lining the streets. A large white arrow, part of the scene, points downward and aligns with the front of the vehicle. The camera angle transitions from level to high, providing a high-angle view while remaining above the second car. Overlay elements enhance the scene: \"Beach\" appears at the top right, a \"segments\" counter and circular minimap are in the bottom left, and a circular gauge with a percentage and numerical value is in the bottom right. At the bottom center, an overlay displays \"280 / 4040 Passengers,\" with a partially filled purple line underneath.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a tracking shot of a locomotive in an urban environment, starting from the ground and rising into the air. The city seems to be surrounded by the train's body, with many connected train cars visible in motion. The overall scene presents a wide view, with the locomotive occupying about 50% of the frame's height in the foreground, while the rest of the frame is revealing the surrounding urban landscape.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
