    "pre_caption": "This high-angle full shot opens with an olive-green helicopter in the top-left foreground, positioned over a ship that occupies the center and bottom of the frame in the middle ground. The ship is surrounded by dark water. The helicopter then flies away from the camera and exits the frame at the top right. As it leaves, the shot transitions into a medium shot, focusing on the bow of the ship, which remains in the center of the frame. A prominent yellow crane is visible on the ship's deck in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An olive-green military-style helicopter with a rounded nose and large pods on its sides is shown flying close to a ship on dark water. The helicopter moves away from the camera's perspective, revealing the bow of the vessel below. The ship has a white and grey hull and features a prominent, yellow, lattice-like crane structure on its deck. The deck is also equipped with various white and grey mechanical components, including vents, winches, and several small objects with red and white stripes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A drone video captures a military-style helicopter flying over a ship on the open sea. The grey-green helicopter, with its rotors in motion, initially appears close before moving away over the vessel below. The ship features a white superstructure, a grey deck, and a prominent yellow, lattice-like crane amidships. Various pieces of equipment, including white cylindrical tanks and satellite dishes, are visible on its decks. The vessel is surrounded by dark, choppy water. A subtitle overlay at the bottom of the screen reads, \"[2]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
