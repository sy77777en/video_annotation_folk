    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, a convoy of vehicles travels diagonally across the frame from the bottom left toward the top right. The convoy occupies the middle ground, situated on a two-lane highway that follows the same diagonal path. A police SUV is positioned at the bottom left, leading the procession. It is followed by three armored trucks, a large semi-truck in the center of the frame, two more armored trucks, and a final SUV at the top right. The surrounding arid desert landscape with sparse vegetation fills the foreground and extends into the background, where low hills are visible. The camera tracks parallel to the convoy, maintaining its elevated position as the vehicles move forward.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An aerial view shows a convoy of eight vehicles driving side by side, occupying two lanes on a four-lane, two-directional highway through a desert. At the front of the convoy is a black SUV with white doors, police markings, and a light bar on the roof. Following the police vehicle are three identical green, heavily armored military trucks, each with an angular body, small windows, and a turret-like structure on top. In the center of the convoy is a large white semi-truck with a long, unmarked rectangular trailer. Behind the semi-truck are two more of the same green armored military vehicles. Bringing up the rear of the entire procession is another black SUV, identical to the one leading the convoy.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective of a convoy moving along a two-lane asphalt road that stretches through a vast, arid desert landscape. The terrain is sandy and brown, dotted with sparse, dry green bushes and small trees, while low, rocky hills and mesas are visible in the distance under a clear daytime sky. The convoy occupies both lanes of the road, with some vehicles slightly overlapping. It includes a black SUV at the front, followed by several dark green, armored military-style trucks, a large white semi-truck with a trailer, and more armored vehicles bringing up the rear. The road is marked with double yellow lines down the center.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
