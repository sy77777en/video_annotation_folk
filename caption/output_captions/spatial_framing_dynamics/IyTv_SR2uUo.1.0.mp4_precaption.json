    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man is captured from a point-of-view perspective while riding a motocross bike. He is wearing a full racing uniform, including a white, red, and blue full-face helmet with a Red Bull logo and dark-lensed goggles. His long-sleeved jersey is gray on the torso and light mint green on the sleeves, with the word \"SEVEN\" printed on the chest and arms. He wears black racing pants with red and white protective gear on his knees and bright yellow gloves. He is gripping the handlebars of his bright yellow and white Suzuki dirt bike, which has the number \"7\" in black on the front number plate.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, with the camera mounted to the front of a motocross bike, captures a rider in mid-air over an outdoor dirt track during the daytime. The track is composed of reddish-brown dirt, featuring large jumps and banked curves. Beyond the track, a landscape of green fields and scattered trees extends under a bright blue sky with white clouds. The rider is positioned on a yellow and white dirt bike, which has the number seven on its front plate, as it soars through the air.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures a motocross rider and their bike from a point-of-view perspective, with the camera mounted on the front of the bike looking back at the rider. The rider and the handlebars are positioned in the center foreground throughout the clip. The scene begins with the rider in mid-air, with a reddish-brown dirt track visible in the middle ground and background below. As the rider and bike soar through the air, the entire frame, locked onto the bike, tilts to the left, showing more of the sky in the top right and the dirt track in the bottom left. The rider remains centrally framed while adjusting their position on the bike during the jump.",
