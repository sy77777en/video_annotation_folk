    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot from the subject's level, a white sneaker on a foot occupies the bottom-left foreground. The concrete pavement fills the rest of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, where a yellow line is briefly visible in the top-left corner. The foot steps forward and down, moving from the left side of the frame toward the center. As the sneaker moves, the yellow line in the background exits the frame, and the sneaker remains the dominant foreground element, shifting its position slightly toward the center-right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white, chunky sneaker is shown on a person's foot. The shoe features a thick, sculpted sole and a molded overlay covering the upper part, which has a ribbed, cage-like structure. The cuff of a pair of black pants is visible just above the sneaker.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a high-angle, close-up shot, a person wearing black pants and a chunky, all-white sneaker steps on a concrete surface. The sneaker has a complex design with a thick, sculpted sole and a cage-like overlay on its upper. The outdoor urban scene is characterized by a cool, teal-tinted color palette that affects the appearance of the pavement. In the background, a yellow painted line on the road is initially slightly out of focus and soon goes out of view, with a red brick building visible in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
