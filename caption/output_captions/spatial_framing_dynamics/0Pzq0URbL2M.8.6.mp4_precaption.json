    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a dark, irregularly shaped object with a rough, crumpled texture, resembling a piece of rock or thick, folded fabric. It is positioned inside a dimly lit enclosure, possibly a box, with light filtering in from the left through horizontal slats, casting highlights on the object's uneven surface while leaving much of it in deep shadow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a static indoor scene, presented from an objective point of view. The setting is very dark, focusing on an object within a confined, box-like space. Light enters from the left through horizontal slats, illuminating a central object that appears to be made of a dark, heavily crumpled material with a rough, stone-like texture. The object fills much of the visible space within the enclosure, casting deep shadows. The overall color palette is muted and dominated by dark tones and shadows, contrasted by the brighter light filtering through the slats.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera appears to be above the subject, looking straight down, but the lack of background information makes it hard to be certain.

    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static medium shot focused on a dark, irregularly shaped object positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the middle ground. To the left, also in the middle ground, light filters through horizontal slats, illuminating the object. The edges of an enclosure are visible on the left and right, defining the foreground and middle ground space. Deep shadows occupy the right side of the frame and the background. The camera is positioned slightly above the subject, looking down into the enclosure.",
