    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot, placing a woman in a blue hoodie in the center-left and a man in a yellow jersey on the right, both situated in the middle ground. In the left middle ground, three other people are visible, with a hilly, red-earth landscape in the background. The scene then cuts to a medium close-up that reframes the composition, focusing on the woman who now occupies the center-left foreground. The man in the yellow jersey remains on the right, now partially framed in the foreground, while the other people are no longer visible. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level for the duration of the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The primary focus of the video is a light-skinned woman with long, wavy blonde hair, who is wearing a white knit beanie, a black tank top, and a bright blue zip-up hoodie. She is standing and speaking to a light-skinned man with short brown hair, a short beard, and a tattoo on his left forearm. This man is dressed in a vibrant yellow and green long-sleeved motocross jersey and has goggles resting on the back of his head. In the background, three other people are standing and observing the interaction. This group consists of a man wearing a black t-shirt, sunglasses, and a backward baseball cap while holding a pole, and two women standing further back.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds in a dry, hilly landscape characterized by reddish-brown earth and sparse, low-lying scrub brush. The terrain is uneven, with dirt paths winding through the arid environment. In the background, larger red rock formations rise against an overcast sky. A small group of people is gathered on one of the slopes, positioned amidst the natural scenery.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
