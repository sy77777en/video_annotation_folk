    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, featuring a red car positioned in the bottom-left foreground. A large building occupies the left side of the frame in the middle ground, with a silver car parked behind the red one. In the right middle ground, a white van is parked on the opposite side of the street, with trees visible behind it. The camera, positioned at the car's level, moves forward and slightly to the right, transitioning into a full shot of the red car. In the final framing, the car fills the bottom half of the frame from the left edge to the center-right, now clearly in the foreground, while the building on the left occupies the top-left quadrant. A watermark remains fixed in the bottom-right corner throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A bright red Ferrari 360 Modena is parked on the left side of a city street, positioned within white painted parking lines. The two-door sports car has a sleek, low-profile design and features silver, five-spoke, star-shaped wheels with yellow center caps. A silver sedan is parked behind the Ferrari on the left side of the street. On the right side, a large white van is parked, and in front of it is a gray sedan. A large, multi-story building with a light-colored stone facade and numerous windows lines the left side of the street.The building on the right side of the street has a light-colored stone facade. In the bottom right corner, a watermark displays the text \"the STRADMAN\" in red and black lettering.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person point of view, the scene unfolds on a city street during the day under an overcast sky, with the camera moving closer to a parked vehicle. A bright red, low-profile sports car with five-spoke silver wheels rests in a parking bay delineated by white lines on the dark asphalt. The street is flanked by a grand, multi-story building with a light-colored stone facade and numerous rectangular windows. Further down the road, a white van is visible, along with a silver sedan and some green, leafy trees. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"the Stradman\" in red and white.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
