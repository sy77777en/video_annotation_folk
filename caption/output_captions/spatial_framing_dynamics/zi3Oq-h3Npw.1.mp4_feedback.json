    "pre_caption": "This full shot begins with two fighters positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The fighter on the right, in black shorts, is bent over the fighter on the left, who is in white shorts. The octagonal cage and a background crowd surround them, while logos are visible on the mat at the bottom of the frame and on the cage posts in the middle ground. As the fighter in white shorts lifts and slams the other fighter, the camera pans slightly right and tilts down to follow their movement toward the bottom of the frame. The shot ends with the fighters on the mat in the middle ground, as the head and shoulders of a referee enter the foreground from the bottom, partially obscuring the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two men are engaged in a mixed martial arts fight inside an octagonal cage with a grey mat. The first man is a large, muscular, bald, light-skinned individual wearing black shorts with white designs. He is attempting a takedown on the second man, who is also light-skinned with short brown hair and is wearing white shorts with black and yellow designs. However, the man with brown hair counters by wrapping his arms around the bald man's torso, lifting him off the ground, and slamming him onto the mat.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside an octagonal fighting cage with a black chain-link fence and black padded corner posts, one displaying \"UFC.COM\" and another showing \"SYNTHA6.COM\" printed vertically in yellow text. The floor is a grey mat marked with several large, colorful logos, including a circular orange and white \"GF EFLY.COM\" design, a white \"TAPOUT\" logo, and an orange and black Harley-Davidson shield. Two fighters are in the center of the mat, with one in the process of taking the other to the ground. The octagon is brightly lit, while the background shows a dimly lit crowd of spectators. Several text and logo overlays are present: a white \"FN\" logo is in the top right, and \"COURTESY: ZUFFA, L.L.C\" is in the bottom right. \"Harley-Davidson.com\" is printed on the left horizontal post.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
