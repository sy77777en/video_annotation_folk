    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a retro-style, pixelated scene with a predominantly blue and purple color scheme. The central focus is a circular object with a distinctive half green and half black design, where the green wraps halfway around the black section. The black portion features a white face-like design, making it stand out against the background. Although this object moves and is not always centered, its contrasting colors ensure it remains the main subject. Surrounding elements, such as hexagonal shapes and a grid-like path with dashed lines, suggest movement or progression but serve as secondary features. The overall aesthetic is reminiscent of classic video games, emphasizing simple, blocky graphics and a limited color palette.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a gaming scene with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is positioned directly above the character, looking down. The setting is a digital, pixelated environment with a predominantly blue color scheme. The scene features a grid-like layout with roads and pathways, marked by dashed lines and arrows, suggesting movement or direction. Notable visual elements include rectangular structures with grid patterns, possibly representing buildings or obstacles, and various geometric shapes like squares and hexagons, which may serve as interactive or collectible items. The environment is static, with no visible weather conditions, and the time of day is not discernible due to the digital nature of the scene. Overlay elements include text at the top of the screen displaying scores and level information, as well as a title or logo at the top center, which reads \"URIDIUM.\" These overlays are not part of the scene itself but provide context for the gameplay.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video displays a wide shot of a retro-style game scene, capturing the entire play area. The central subject, a circular object with a half-green, half-black design, is initially positioned near the bottom center of the frame, moving horizontally across the scene. This object occupies the foreground, while the surrounding elements form the middle ground. As the object progresses, it shifts from the left side towards the right, maintaining its prominence in the frame. The background consists of a grid-like path with dashed lines and arrows, along with rectangular structures featuring grid patterns. These elements remain static throughout the sequence. The camera maintains a top-down perspective, positioned above the action, providing a clear view of the entire scene. The spatial arrangement remains consistent, with the circular object consistently in motion while other elements stay fixed. The camera does not change height or angle, ensuring a stable view of the gameplay.",
