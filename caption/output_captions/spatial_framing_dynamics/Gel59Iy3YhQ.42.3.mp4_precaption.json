    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a scene rendered in a stark, monochromatic, 1-bit dithered art style, featuring off-white outlines and stippling against a dark background. The setting is an interior space, possibly a hallway or cabin, viewed from a wide-angle perspective. In the center-left middleground, a human figure lies face down on the floor with one arm bent, propping against the ground. Due to the stylized graphics, specific details about the person's clothing or identity are ambiguous. The space contains only two doors: one closed on the left and one open in the center. On the right side, there's a doorway but no door. Left of the right-hand doorway, a geometric, diamond-shaped ornament hangs from a hook on the wall. A bright patch of light illuminates the wooden-planked floor around the central doorway in the lower-center of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A scene rendered in a high-contrast, 1-bit dithered art style with white outlines on a dark background shows the interior of a hallway, possibly within a ship's cabin. The floor and ceiling are constructed from horizontal planks. In the middleground, a person lies on the floor. The hallway features several doorways: one closed on the left, one open in the center revealing a small room with furniture, and a doorway on the right without a door. A geometric, diamond-shaped lantern hangs on a hook to the left of the right doorway. A bright patch of light illuminates the floor around the center door.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static, wide shot from a low-angle, one-point perspective looking down an interior hallway. In the bottom-left middle ground, a figure lies on the floor. The back wall, located in the middle ground, features three doorways: a closed door on the left, an open door in the center that reveals a small room in the background, and a doorway without a door on the right. A geometric ornament hangs on the wall in the upper-right middle ground, to the left of the rightmost doorway. A bright patch of light illuminates the floor in the bottom-center middle ground, directly in front of the central open door. The camera is positioned at a low height, looking straight ahead.",
