    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a large, submerged crocodile-like creature or object resting on the ocean floor. Its textured exterior is mottled with shades of gray, resembling rocky terrain. The object's elongated body is partially illuminated by beams of light filtering through the water, highlighting its rough, scaly surface. A prominent, jagged dorsal ridge runs along the top, and its left side extends outward, tapering to a point. The right side is broad and flat, with visible ridges on the top, giving it a prehistoric appearance. There are extended structure that stick out slightly near the middle of the object, and the overall scene conveys a sense of stillness and ancient presence.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an underwater scene featuring a sunken metallic structure resting on the ocean floor. The dimly lit environment is enhanced by beams of light filtering through the water, creating a serene and mysterious atmosphere. The structure, likely a shipwreck, is adorned with marine growth, showcasing a rugged texture with a blend of rusted metal and encrusted surfaces. The clear water offers a view of the sandy seabed, illuminated by dappled light. The setting is tranquil, with no visible movement, highlighting the stillness of the underwater world. An overlay element, positioned in the bottom left corner, displays \"[2]\" without obstructing the view, ensuring it remains unobtrusive within the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a large, submerged crocodile-like object resting on the ocean floor. The subject occupies the center of the frame, extending horizontally from the left to the right. Positioned in the middle ground, the object is clearly visible against the sandy seabed. The camera is situated above the subject, providing a top-down perspective. Beams of light filter through the water from the top of the frame, casting dynamic patterns across the object and the seabed. The left side of the object tapers to a point, while the right side is broader and flatter. The object remains stationary throughout the sequence, maintaining its central position. The sandy seabed forms the foreground, while faint outlines of additional underwater elements are visible in the background. The overlay element displaying \"[2]\" is located in the bottom left corner, remaining static and unobtrusive. No significant changes in shot size or spatial position occur during the video.",
