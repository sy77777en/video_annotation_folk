    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features several colossal humanoid figures with exposed muscles and no skin, towering over a cityscape. The main subject is a central giant, distinguished by its massive size and prominent muscular structure, standing upright with a forward-facing posture. Surrounding this figure are other similar giants, each displaying the same muscular appearance, with a fluid, similar in color to the muscles, flowing from their heads, contributing to a sense of overwhelming scale. In the foreground, a harbor with a docked ship and industrial buildings is visible, emphasizing the contrast between the giants and the human-made structures. The scene conveys a dramatic juxtaposition of the immense figures against the smaller, detailed city elements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a dramatic outdoor scene set during the day, featuring a group of colossal figures with exposed muscle structures, towering over a landscape. The sky is filled with large, fluffy clouds with patches of blue visible behind them. The figures are positioned near a waterfront area with a dock, where a ship is moored. The dock is lined with buildings featuring red-tiled roofs and industrial elements, suggesting a port setting. Splashes are visible next to the boat, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The overall atmosphere combines natural and industrial features, with the massive figures dominating the skyline.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium full shot of the colossal humanoid figures, capturing their entire bodies from head to toe. The main subject, a central giant, is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. This figure stands upright, facing forward. Surrounding giants are placed symmetrically on either side, slightly further back in the middle ground. The camera is positioned below the subjects, looking up at them. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing more closely on the upper bodies of the giants. The central figure remains in the center, while the surrounding giants are still visible but less prominently. The background includes a sky with large clouds and a waterfront area with a docked ship and industrial buildings in the bottom part of the frame. The ship and buildings are in the foreground, contrasting with the giants' immense size. The camera maintains its low angle throughout, emphasizing the towering presence of the figures.",
