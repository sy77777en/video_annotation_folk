    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows several kites soaring against a pale blue sky with wispy clouds. Two kites are red, and one is yellow, while the colors of the others are unclear; all are diamond-shaped and connected by thin strings. A hand, partially visible in the lower left, holds a blue or greyish-blue cylindrical kite reel with flanges and a handle, from which a string extends towards the kites, indicating a first-person perspective of someone flying them. The dark foliage of a tree is visible on the right edge of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, looks up at a pale blue sky from an outdoor location during the day. The sky is filled with thin, wispy white clouds. Several small kites, including clearly visible red and yellow ones, fly high in the distance, while the colors of the other kites are indistinct. Their thin strings are barely visible against the sky. The top of a leafy green tree is visible on the right side of the scene. In the foreground, a hand holds a blue plastic kite winder, with the string extending upwards towards the kites.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video opens with a broad view of kites soaring in a pale sky. A hand occasionally enters the frame, holding a kite reel, suggesting a first-person perspective.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is captured from a low-angle, first-person perspective, presenting a wide shot of the sky that fills the entire background. Initially, several small kites are visible in the middle ground, scattered across the central area of the frame against a backdrop of wispy clouds in the upper half. The dark foliage of a tree occupies the right edge of the frame in the middle ground. A moment into the video, a hand holding a blue kite reel moves into the shot from the bottom, positioning itself in the foreground at the bottom left. This action establishes a clear sense of depth, as the kite string can be seen extending from the foreground reel up towards the kites in the middle ground, connecting the viewer's perspective directly to the distant objects. The reel remains in the foreground for the rest of the clip.",
