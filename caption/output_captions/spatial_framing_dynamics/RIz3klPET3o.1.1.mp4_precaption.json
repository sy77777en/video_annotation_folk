    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a small, black-and-white, cartoon-like figure with a trapezoidal head, one visible dot-like eye in profile, and a small, pointed, black-and-white hat. This figure is seated on a simple, black, curved sled and is adorned with small, distinct orange, green, and blue dots at its back. The path for this figure is represented by a thick, black, curved line that later transforms into various angular, geometric shapes composed of black lines.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile, shows a minimalist environment with a plain white background. A small, black-and-white character on a sled, which has tiny orange, green, and blue dots, moves along a dynamically changing black line. This line forms various paths, including curves and angular polygonal shapes, appearing and disappearing as the character progresses across the white void.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is presented as an extreme wide shot against a plain white background, which occupies the background layer. In the middle ground, a small, black-and-white cartoon figure on a sled is initially seen in the top right of the frame, moving along a black curved line that stretches from the bottom left to the top right, also in the middle ground. After the initial line and figure briefly vanish, the figure reappears in the top right, middle ground. Subsequently, various black, angular geometric line shapes materialize and dematerialize sequentially in the middle ground, typically appearing near the figure, which then moves along their perimeters. The figure's 2D position within the frame dynamically shifts, predominantly occupying the right and central areas, while consistently remaining in the middle ground. The camera maintains a side-view perspective, positioned level with the character's plane of movement.",
