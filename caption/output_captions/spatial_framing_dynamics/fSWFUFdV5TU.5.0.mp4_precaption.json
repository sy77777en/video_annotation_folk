    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A bald man, seen in silhouette from the back, stands in a dimly lit room wearing a dark coat. A brief flash of light illuminates a tapestry with an intricate design on the wall behind him. As the viewpoint moves closer, the man remains in silhouette, and the outline of his glasses becomes visible against his head. He appears to be adjusting something he is holding in front of him while slowly turning his head to the left, as if staring at something.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a dimly lit interior room, viewed from an objective perspective. A large, dark tapestry with an intricate design in blues and yellows hangs on the back wall. Cabinets are visible on both sides of the room. In the middle, a sofa is draped with light-colored fabric. A window with curtains on the right allows a faint, hazy light to enter the room, which has a smoky or dusty atmosphere. A silhouetted figure of a bald man wearing a coat and glasses is initially seen from the back, standing in the center of the room. The figure moves closer to the camera, remaining in silhouette throughout the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot, featuring a silhouetted man positioned in the center-middle ground of a dimly lit room. Behind him, a tapestry is visible in the center-background. Cabinets are situated in the left-middle ground and right-middle ground, while a partially obscured sofa occupies the center-middle ground. A window on the right-middle ground allows faint light into the scene. The shot then transitions to a medium close-up as the man moves towards the camera, becoming more prominent in the center-foreground. During this movement, he slowly turns his head to the left. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout.",
