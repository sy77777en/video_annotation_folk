    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a coastal scenery shot that presents a layered view of the sea from a rocky shoreline. A large, dark rock with patches of yellow lichen dominates the right foreground, creating a natural frame for the scene beyond. The midground features the dark, choppy sea, with several smaller, seaweed-covered rocks breaking the surface. In the distance, a prominent, pale, dome-shaped island sits on the horizon beneath a cloudy, overcast sky. The video lacks a distinct main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural environment. The static composition emphasizes the rugged texture of the rocks, the vastness of the water, and the imposing presence of the distant island.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a rocky shoreline, the view extends across a body of dark blue water toward the horizon. In the foreground, a large, dark brown rock with patches of yellow lichen is prominent on the right. Just offshore, several smaller rocks covered in green seaweed emerge from the gently moving water. In the distance, a large, light-colored, dome-shaped island is visible under an overcast sky filled with grey and white clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of a coastal scene. A large rock is positioned in the right foreground, framing the view. The middle ground is occupied by the sea, with several smaller rocks visible from the bottom left to the center. In the background, a large, dome-shaped island sits on the horizon, slightly to the right of the frame's center, beneath a cloudy sky that fills the top portion of the scene. The camera remains stationary at eye level throughout the shot.",
