    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot initially frames a pair of hands holding a teal spray can, both in the foreground and slightly to the right of the center; the can is initially somewhat blurred. A portion of a person's dark grey shirt is visible on the right edge of the frame, also in the foreground. In the background, an open white cabinet with blurred items on its shelves occupies the left side and extends towards the center. As the shot progresses, the hands bring the can slightly forward and rotate it, moving it more towards the center of the frame where it comes into sharper focus, still in the foreground. The cabinet and the person's shoulder maintain their respective positions. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with light skin, wearing a dark grey short-sleeved shirt, is holding a teal cylindrical spray can. The can features pink and white markings, including a depiction of Hello Kitty with a pink bow on its side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place indoors, in front of a white, open cabinet whose shelves are stocked with various blurred items. A pair of hands, belonging to a person in a dark grey shirt, holds a teal-colored cylindrical can. This can is adorned with pink and white markings, including a white cartoon character. The overall lighting is dim.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
