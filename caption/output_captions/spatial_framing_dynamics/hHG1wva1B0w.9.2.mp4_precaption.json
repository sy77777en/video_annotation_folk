    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a parking lot, a solid red, featureless human figure with a male build stands next to a row of older-model sedans. The figure is entirely monochromatic red, obscuring any clothing or facial details. It is positioned with its body slightly turned, holding its right arm with its left hand in a self-hugging gesture. To the figure's left, in the foreground, is the front of a white sedan with its headlights illuminated and shining brightly. Behind the white car is a dark black vehicle, and behind that is the pale green sedan.and two other dark-colored sedans are visible parked further down the row.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor parking lot during late afternoon, a row of vintage sedans is parked on dark asphalt marked with white lines. The sunlight creates long shadows and casts a bright glare on the glossy surfaces of the cars, which include a black vehicle and a portion of a white car in the foreground, with a light blue-green one behind them. A solid red, human-like figure stands between two of the cars. An overlay of white text is present at the bottom left of the screen, reading \"[2,3].\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot, a red human figure is positioned in the left-center of the frame and in the middle ground of a parking lot. To the figure's right, a row of cars is arranged diagonally, receding from the foreground to the background. A black car occupies the right foreground, a light green car is in the center middle ground beside the figure, and two other dark cars are visible further back in the left middle ground and background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
