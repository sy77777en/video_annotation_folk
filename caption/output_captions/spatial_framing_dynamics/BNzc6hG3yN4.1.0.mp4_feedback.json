    "pre_caption": "Initially, in a full shot, the main subject stands on an ATV in the center-left foreground. To his left, another man on a blue ATV is positioned in the middle ground. Directly behind the main subject, two other men and an orange barrier occupy the center middle ground, while a dirt bike is parked in the right middle ground. The scene is framed with the camera at the subjects' level. The camera then moves upward and tilts down, transitioning to a high-angle perspective that looks down on the group. In this final framing, the main subject is repositioned to the bottom-left, while the other subjects and vehicles are seen in the upper portion of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a Black man who is standing on the seat of a custom ATV, with his right leg stepping on the seat and his left leg stepping on the wheel. He is wearing a black puffer jacket over a colorful graphic t-shirt, a necklace, and black pants. Initially, he points his left hand upwards and then raises both arms with elbows bent inward, bringing clenched fists together in front of his chest. The ATV he is on is primarily black and purple, featuring a purple seat, purple-rimmed rear wheels, and a body covered in vibrant, graffiti-style stickers. To his right, another Black man wearing a bright yellow puffer jacket sits on a blue ATV. In the middleground behind the first man, there is a man in a long, dark plaid overcoat and a dark head covering with graffiti-style stickers. Additionally, a fourth man in a long overcoat is standing behind in the middleground. A black and yellow dirt bike with gold-colored rims is parked on the right side of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a large, gray paved area adjacent to a body of water, bordered by a low concrete wall. Several vehicles are present, including a custom ATV in the foreground with a purple and black frame, vibrant graphic decals, and purple-rimmed wheels. In the middle ground, a blue ATV is visible, along with a black and yellow dirt bike parked near an orange plastic traffic barrier. Four men are positioned around the vehicles on the pavement. The camera perspective transitions from a level-angle view to an inverted high-angle shot, looking down but not directly on the group and their vehicles.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
