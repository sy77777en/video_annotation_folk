    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light blue and dark blue airplane, with \"KLM\" visible in white on the side of its nose, is positioned on a grey concrete runway. The aircraft has four jet engines, two under each wing, and its landing gear is deployed. The fuselage is blue, while the wings and tail are white. The lower part of the aircraft is dark blue, with a white line running through the middle, slightly above the wings. White markings are visible on the runway surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a grey airport runway, where a large airplane, painted in blue and white with \"KLM\" markings, is moving forward. The runway surface, made of concrete or asphalt, features white painted lines that appear to be in motion relative to the aircraft. Four jet engines are visible beneath the wings of the plane, and its landing gear is down. The backdrop is a plain, dark grey expanse, suggesting a simplified, non-detailed environment. The overall visual style is characterized by a muted color palette of blues, whites, and greys.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a KLM airplane, initially positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, on a grey runway. The runway, featuring white painted lines, extends from the foreground into the middle ground. A plain dark grey expanse forms the background. As the airplane begins to move forward along the runway, it remains centrally framed but appears to grow larger, moving from the middle ground towards the foreground. Concurrently, the camera, initially at the airplane's level, gradually elevates and tilts slightly downwards, transitioning to a position above the subject. This shift in camera height results in the airplane appearing to move slightly lower within the frame towards the end of the clip, while the runway markings in the foreground and middle ground pass beneath and alongside it.",
