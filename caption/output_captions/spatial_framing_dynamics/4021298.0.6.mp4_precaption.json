    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a scene featuring several camels and a group of people in a rocky, mountainous area. The camera pans right and tilts down to a close-up of a camel's head, highlighting its face and decorative harness. The camels are adorned with colorful, decorative tassels and blankets, adding vibrant hues to their natural brown tones. The people are dressed in different types of clothing, including headscarves and long garments. One man wears a red jacket, while another is in a dark coat with a patterned headscarf. The setting suggests a cultural or tourist activity, with the camels and people interacting in a natural, outdoor environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a scene on a rocky, sunlit mountain path. In the background, a vast range of rugged, brown mountains stretches into the distance under a clear blue sky, suggesting an early morning or late afternoon setting. Several camels are present; some are standing, while others rest on the ground. They are adorned with colorful, patterned saddles and blankets featuring vibrant tassels in red, blue, yellow, and green. A few people in traditional-style clothing, including long robes and head coverings, stand nearby. The perspective shifts to a close-up of one camel's face, which is decorated with a harness and a tuft of black hair, as it looks directly into the camera.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a medium shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a mountainous landscape. A group of people stands in the left foreground, while several camels are positioned in the center middle ground against a backdrop of a vast mountain range. The decorated back of a camel occupies the bottom right foreground. The camera then pans right and tilts down, transitioning into a close-up that reveals a camel's head filling the center-right of the frame in the foreground. The decorated saddle and back of the camel are visible on the left, with the rocky ground and distant mountains in the background. In the final framing, the camera is positioned at the camel's eye level.",
