    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with light skin and brown, styled hair is shown in a dimly lit, blue-toned setting. He wears a dark jacket over a white collared shirt, which is unbuttoned at the top. The man, who has a mustache, is seen from various angles, including from behind, in profile, and facing forward with his eyes closed and a neutral expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting at dusk, the scene is bathed in a cool, blue-toned light. Several older-model buses, painted a muted yellow, are positioned in the background, with some of their headlights illuminated. A man wearing a dark coat over a white collared shirt stands stationary in the space. The slight blur in the background suggests movement as the camera arcs around him.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot from behind a man who is positioned in the center foreground. In the background, several out-of-focus yellow buses are visible. The camera then arcs smoothly from right to left around the man, who remains relatively stationary. This movement transitions the view from his back to his right profile, then to a frontal view, and finally toward his left profile, all while he stays in the center of the frame. As the camera moves, the background buses appear to shift and blur, enhancing the focus on the central subject.",
