    "pre_caption": "This medium full shot is framed from an over-the-shoulder perspective, with the back of a person's head and right shoulder occupying the foreground on the right side of the screen. In the middle ground, an elderly man stands in the center of the frame, with a younger man positioned to his left. The two men are situated within a hall filled with dark wooden latticework that extends from the middle ground into the background. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of this video is an elderly man with long white hair in a topknot and a long, full white beard, who stands in the center of the scene. He wears a long, dark gray, open-front robe over white undergarments, with a black sash at his waist. He stands with a stern expression, his hands held behind his back. To his right stands a younger man with black hair, a mustache, and a goatee, wearing a dark blue robe with light gray sleeves and a white yin-yang symbol on the chest. In the foreground, viewed from over the left shoulder, is a person with dark hair tied back in a ponytail, wearing a dark blue top and facing the two men.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead. The view looks into a dimly lit, traditional East Asian hall filled with dark, intricately carved wooden latticework screens and partitions. In the midground, two men stand. The central figure is an older man with long white hair and a beard, dressed in a grey and white layered robe. To his side stands another man in a dark blue robe featuring a circular symbol on the chest and a flat-topped hat. Small, decorative lanterns and pagoda-like structures are visible amongst the wooden framework, with hints of red and gold in the deep background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
