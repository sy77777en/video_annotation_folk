To the character's left is a fenced garden plot with mature plants, and to the right is another fenced plot containing small saplings, both situated in the middle ground.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A scarecrow-like character with a round, orange pumpkin for a head stands in a garden. The pumpkin head has a simple, carved smiling face with oval eyes and a curved mouth. The character's body consists of thin, stick-like limbs, and it wears a blue, hooded cloak with a light-colored belt on the chest. In one garden plot, there are thirteen mature, leafy green plants. In an adjacent plot, there are several small, withered-looking saplings, some of which are surrounded by a faint blue, sparkling aura.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a third-person 3D game scene set in a quaint, outdoor garden environment at night. The setting features a small, partially enclosed garden with neatly arranged rows of plants. The garden is bordered by a white picket fence, and the ground is covered with a mix of grass and soil. The character, visible on screen, is engaged in tending to the garden, moving between the rows of plants. The garden's soil is dark and freshly tilled, with some areas showing signs of watering, indicated by a slight sheen. Surrounding the garden are patches of green grass and a few decorative stones lining the paths. The overall atmosphere is calm and pastoral, with a warm color palette enhancing the serene rural setting. Overlay elements include a heads-up display at the bottom of the screen, showing various icons and a numerical counter, which are not part of the scene itself.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
