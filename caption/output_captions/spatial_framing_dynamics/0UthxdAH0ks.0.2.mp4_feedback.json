    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a long, arched structure resembling a greenhouse or animal enclosure. The camera captures the entire length of the corridor, showing metal railings lining both sides. The corridor extends from the foreground to the background, with the far end visible at the center of the frame. The sides of the corridor feature transparent panels, allowing a view of the outdoors. The camera remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective. The spatial position of the corridor remains unchanged, with the central pathway running directly towards the viewer. The camera is positioned at a height that aligns with the corridor's midline, providing a clear view of the entire scene. The subtitles appear at the bottom of the frame, overlaying the scene without altering the spatial composition. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a long, arched structure resembling a greenhouse or animal enclosure, with metal railings lining both sides. A black dog is centrally positioned, barking at the camera. The setting is dimly lit, creating a muted atmosphere. The dog appears to be moving through the corridor, which is flanked by enclosures containing animals, likely pigs. The overall scene suggests a controlled environment, possibly for livestock or agricultural purposes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting within a large, industrial livestock farm. The environment features a long, arched ceiling, while the sides are transparent, allowing a view of the outdoors. The interior is divided into different sections by metal railings, likely for pig farming, suggesting an organized, utilitarian design. The atmosphere is dim, indicating an overcast day. The scene includes motion, with a black dog barking. Overlays include subtitles at the bottom, displaying text in both Chinese and English, such as \"Keep going!\" and \"Stop acting like pigs!\" These overlays are not part of the physical environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
