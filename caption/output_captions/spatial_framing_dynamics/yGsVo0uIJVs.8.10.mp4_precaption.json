    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a silhouetted, abstract form that appears to be a large, irregularly shaped object or structure. It is predominantly dark, with a few protruding elements that suggest a complex, possibly mechanical or organic nature. The object is set against a backdrop of bright, diffused blue light, creating a stark contrast that emphasizes its outline. The light radiates outward, adding a sense of depth and dimension to the scene. The overall composition suggests a mysterious or otherworldly atmosphere, with the focus on the interplay between the dark silhouette and the luminous background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a scene that evokes an underwater atmosphere, with a mysterious and dramatic tone. The setting features a silhouette of an indistinct object or structure, possibly draped fabric or a large piece of equipment, set against a backdrop of intense, blue-tinted light beams. These beams create a striking contrast, highlighting the silhouette's edges and adding depth to the scene. The lighting, while suggesting a controlled source, contributes to the impression of being submerged, casting long shadows and emphasizing the texture of the silhouetted object. The overall color scheme is dominated by deep blacks and vibrant blues, enhancing the moody and enigmatic ambiance. An overlay element, marked as [2], is located in the bottom left corner, but not part of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene is viewed from a low angle, looking up towards a large, dark, silhouetted abstract form that dominates the foreground and center of the frame. This form extends towards the top, left, and right edges. Smaller silhouetted elements are visible in the foreground: one near the top left and another near the bottom center. The background consists of bright blue light beams radiating outwards from behind the central silhouette. Throughout the shot, the large central silhouette subtly shifts and rotates, altering its specific shape within the frame while maintaining its dominant foreground position.",
