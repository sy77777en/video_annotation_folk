    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit, cavernous space, a small boy with dark hair is seen wearing a brown shirt and dark pants. To his right, a long, orderly line of adult figures stands motionless, all facing a dark wall. These figures are uniformly dressed in plain white, short-sleeved shirts, with pants varying in color from dark to light, presenting a stark, almost mannequin-like appearance. Their features are indistinct, and they are illuminated by a light source coming from the right, casting long, dramatic shadows. A small, wheeled table with a light-colored top and a white object resting on it is positioned to the left of the line of people. In the background, a white, open-sided golf cart with its headlights on is also present.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video, a small character in a brown shirt stands within a vast, dark, and cavernous indoor space defined by large support pillars and a high, arched ceiling. The scene is rendered in a stark, monochromatic style, with a bright beam of light coming from the right, casting onto a long line of pale, humanoid figures in white clothing. These figures stand still, facing a dark wall and casting long shadows across the floor, which features a section of dark grating. To the left, a series of dimly lit, glass-walled rooms can be seen in the background. A small, wheeled cart with an object on its surface is positioned to the left of the line. A small, white vehicle with its headlights on drives into the scene from the left.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a high angle, shows a small boy in the center-left middle ground of a vast, dark space. To his right, in the middle ground, a long line of motionless, pale figures stretches from the center to the right side of the frame, illuminated by a spotlight from the right that casts long shadows to the left. A wheeled table sits between the boy and the line. In the background left, dimly lit, glass-walled rooms are visible, while a large pillar in the left foreground frames the scene. The boy briefly moves right, toward the line of figures, before a white golf cart with its headlights on enters from the background left and stops near the front of the line.",
