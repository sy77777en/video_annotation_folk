    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a parking lot, capturing three parked cars and part of a modern office building in the background. Initially, the beige sedan is centrally positioned in the middle ground, with the silver SUV to its left and a dark-colored car partially visible on the right edge. The office building occupies the upper portion of the background, extending across the frame. The camera remains at waist height throughout, providing a consistent view of the scene. As the video progresses, a metal cabinet falls from the top right area of the frame, landing in the foreground near the center. This action causes papers to scatter into the air, filling the middle ground momentarily before settling around the cabinet. The cabinet ends up toppled over in the foreground, below the camera's height, while the camera maintains its original position. The overall spatial dynamics shift slightly due to the falling cabinet and scattered papers, but the primary elements\u2014the cars and the building\u2014remain static in their respective positions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a parking lot with three parked cars. The first car, a beige sedan, is centrally positioned, while a silver SUV is parked to its left. A third car, partially visible on the right edge, is dark-colored. A metal cabinet falls to the ground, scattering numerous papers into the air, which eventually settle on the ground. The scene captures the moment of impact and the resulting disarray of papers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting in a parking lot adjacent to a modern office building with large reflective windows. The building's facade is a light beige color, and the windows mirror the surrounding environment, including some greenery. The scene takes place during the day, under clear weather conditions. Several cars are parked in designated spaces, with a beige sedan prominently positioned near a neatly trimmed hedge. The pavement is smooth and marked with white lines for parking. Towards the end of the video, a filing cabinet and papers are scattered on the ground near the vehicles, disrupting the otherwise calm and orderly atmosphere created by the architecture and parked cars.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video opens with a wide shot of a parking lot featuring three parked cars, with one partially visible at the right edge of the frame. Suddenly, a metal cabinet falls to the ground, scattering numerous papers into the air before they eventually settle on the ground.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera starts at waist height, showing a parking lot with cars. When the metal cabinet falls, it ends up toppled below the camera\u2019s height, while the camera stays at the same level.",
