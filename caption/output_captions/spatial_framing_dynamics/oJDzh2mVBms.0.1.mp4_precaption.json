    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot of a remote, snow-covered location under a starry night sky. Vibrant green ribbons of the aurora borealis dance and shift across the deep blue expanse, forming ethereal curtains of light. In the foreground, a thick blanket of snow covers the ground, leading up to a line of dark evergreen trees and a small, white, functional-looking building with satellite dishes and antennas on its roof. The video lacks a single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the vast, atmospheric beauty of the arctic night. The focus is on the interplay between the natural wonder of the aurora and the isolated human structure, creating a sense of scale and wonder.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse video captures the aurora borealis dancing across a star-filled night sky in a remote, snowy landscape. In the middle ground, a small, white, box-like building with a satellite dish and various antennas on its roof sits amidst deep snow. A line of dark evergreen trees forms the horizon behind the structure. In the middle of the video, a sudden burst of intense light briefly illuminates one side of the building, creating a bright flash. Throughout the sequence, vibrant green ribbons of light from the aurora shift, brighten, and move across the dark blue expanse of the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, static shot of a snowy landscape at night. The foreground is filled with snow covering the bottom third of the frame. In the middle ground, a white, box-like building is situated in the bottom right, with a satellite dish to its left. A line of dark evergreen trees extends across the middle ground behind the building. The background is dominated by the dark, star-filled sky, which takes up the upper two-thirds of the frame. Throughout the shot, vibrant green ribbons of the aurora borealis dynamically shift and move across the background sky. Initially, they appear as faint bands, but then a bright green ribbon emerges from the top left and moves towards the center, while other formations of the aurora appear and fade across the entire expanse of the sky. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the scene.",
