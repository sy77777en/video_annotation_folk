    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with short blonde hair, wearing a grey V-neck T-shirt and dark pants, stands in the background. In the foreground, the left hand and forearm of a person in a dark long-sleeved shirt and a watch are visible. This person's hand opens a wooden drawer. The focus shifts from the woman to the opened drawer as the hand picks up a black flashlight from inside the drawer and turns it on, casting a beam of light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a perspective beside a wooden drawer, the view looks toward the drawer and into a dimly lit room. A hand reaches into the drawer, retrieves a black flashlight, and turns it on. The bright, circular beam of light is cast onto the interior, illuminating the light-colored wood of the drawer and the speckled pattern on the underside of a granite countertop above. In the background, a woman stands in a softly lit hallway, with a framed picture visible on the wall to her left. Dark wooden cabinets are also present in the room.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video starts with a full shot of a woman standing in the background, while in the foreground, a close-up shows another person's hand opening a drawer and taking out a flashlight. Initially, both the woman and the hand are visible, but the focus shifts from the woman in the background to the hand in the foreground through a rack focus.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a woman standing in the background at the center of the frame, while a close-up simultaneously shows a person's hand and arm in the foreground on the left. An open wooden drawer occupies the bottom of the frame, with a countertop visible in the upper right. As the hand on the left reaches into the drawer to retrieve a flashlight, the focus racks from the woman in the background to the hand and drawer in the foreground. The hand then moves the activated flashlight, casting its beam from the bottom center of the frame toward the upper right, illuminating the underside of the countertop. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
