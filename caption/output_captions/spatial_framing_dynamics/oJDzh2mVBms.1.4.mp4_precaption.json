    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot of a vibrant green aurora borealis illuminating a nocturnal, wintry environment. The northern lights appear as broad, shifting curtains of light that fill the dark sky, with faint stars visible in the background. A dark silhouette of a dense coniferous treeline marks the horizon, separating the bright white, snow-covered ground from the dynamic sky. There is no main subject, highlighting the natural phenomenon and the vast landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a nighttime outdoor scene, the sky is dominated by the vibrant green Aurora Borealis. The celestial light appears in broad, shifting bands and curtains that move across the dark, star-filled sky. Below, a vast, flat landscape is covered in white snow, bordered in the distance by the dark silhouette of a dense coniferous forest.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot with no main subject, captured from a low angle looking up at the sky. A snow-covered landscape occupies the bottom third of the frame in the foreground. A dark silhouette of a treeline stretches horizontally across the middle ground, separating the snow from the sky. The top two-thirds of the frame are filled by the sky in the background, which is illuminated by the green aurora borealis. Initially, the aurora appears as distinct bands, with one prominent band extending from the top left towards the center and another on the right. As the time-lapse progresses, these bands of light shift, expand, and morph, becoming more diffuse and cloud-like, eventually filling most of the upper frame with swirling green light.",
