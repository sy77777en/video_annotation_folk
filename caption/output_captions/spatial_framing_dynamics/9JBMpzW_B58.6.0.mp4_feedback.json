    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures an industrial scene from a slightly low-angle view aboard a container ship docked at a port. The shot looks out over stacks of multicolored shipping containers on the ship's deck towards a massive white ship-to-shore crane, labeled \"SAVANNAH, GA. U.S.A no 39,\" which dominates the frame. In the background, a wide river and the sprawling port with more cranes and container stacks are visible under a grey, overcast sky. The scene is captured through a lens spattered with raindrops, adding to the gloomy, wet atmosphere. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale of the maritime shipping operation and the industrial environment rather than focusing on a specific object or action.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high vantage point aboard a container ship, the scene captures a view of the Port of Savannah, Georgia, on a rainy, overcast day. The perspective looks forward over the tops of stacked shipping containers on the ship's deck. A massive white gantry crane, marked with \"SAVANNAH, GA. U.S.A no 39\" in black lettering, looms directly overhead. To the left is a wide, murky river, and to the right, the dock is filled with numerous stacks of colorful shipping containers under a gray sky. The entire view is seen through a lens covered in water droplets from the rain. A watermark overlay reading \"JEFFREY.HK\" is present in the lower right-center of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
