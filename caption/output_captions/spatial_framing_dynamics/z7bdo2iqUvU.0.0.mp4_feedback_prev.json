    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a person wearing a dark, heavy coat with a fur-lined hood. The subject occupies the center of the frame, with their upper torso and head visible. The person is positioned in the foreground, with no other elements in the middle ground or background. The fur-lined hood covers most of the subject's face, leaving only part of their nose visible initially. The subject remains stationary throughout the sequence, with minimal movement. The camera maintains a consistent position at the subject's height, capturing the subject directly from the front. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position during the video. The background is uniformly dark, ensuring the subject remains the focal point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person wearing a dark, heavy coat with a prominent fur-lined hood that obscures most of their face, except for their nose, which is visible at the beginning and reveals a light skin tone. The coat has visible zippers and buttons, and the hood's fur is thick and light brown, creating a striking contrast against the dark fabric. The person is facing forward, and their face is mostly hidden by the hood and high collar of the coat, making it difficult to discern specific facial features or expressions. The overall appearance suggests a focus on warmth and protection from cold weather.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a dimly lit, indoor setting with a focus on a person wearing a dark jacket featuring a prominent fur-lined hood. The fur is a mix of brown and beige tones, providing a stark contrast against the black background. The jacket has visible zippers and buttons, adding metallic accents to the scene. The lighting is low, creating a shadowy atmosphere that emphasizes the texture of the fur and the material of the jacket. The overall mood is subdued, with the person centrally positioned, drawing attention to the details of their outerwear.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
