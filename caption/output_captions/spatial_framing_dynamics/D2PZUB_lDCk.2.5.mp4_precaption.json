    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This abstract video features a dark, brownish-gold background filled with digital elements. The bottom of the scene is composed of a dense, undulating surface made of countless tiny, glowing golden particles, resembling a shimmering digital sea. From this surface, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rise upwards, each with a brighter point at its tip. Throughout the scene, smaller, out-of-focus golden specks of light float and drift, all rising, creating a sense of depth and movement. A bright, horizontal glow is present at the horizon line, serving as the source for the rising light streaks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An abstract scene is set against a dark background, featuring a landscape of undulating, shimmering golden particles at the bottom. From this wavy surface, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rise upwards, varying in length and brightness. A bright, horizontal light source glows at the center of the horizon line. Smaller, glowing golden and white specks drift throughout the space, rising with the light streaks.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "In this abstract scene, an undulating surface of shimmering golden particles occupies the bottom of the frame, positioned in the foreground and middle ground. A bright, horizontal light source is located in the center of the frame on the horizon line, situated in the middle ground. From this central point, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rise upwards through the middle ground. Smaller glowing particles are scattered throughout the entire frame, existing in the foreground, middle ground, and background, all drifting in a constant upward motion. The camera maintains a static, low-angle position, looking across the shimmering surface toward the rising light.",
