    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an interior scenery shot depicting a dark, narrow hallway at night, viewed from the deep shadows of an adjacent room. A faint, cool light from an unseen source dimly illuminates a white door at the end of the hall, while the foreground remains almost entirely obscured, revealing only the dark silhouette of a houseplant and the edge of a bed. The focus is on the unsettling atmosphere of the environment, using the low-key lighting and the partially obstructed viewpoint to create a sense of suspense rather than highlighting a specific subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dark residence at night, looking from a room into a dimly lit hallway. The hallway is illuminated by a faint, cool-toned light, casting deep shadows. Several white doors are visible along the corridor, with one in the distance featuring a small, grated window near its top. On the right wall of the hallway hangs a square panel. In the dark foreground to the left, the silhouette of a houseplant is visible next to a wall with a faint floral or paisley pattern.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of interior scenery, framed from within a dark room looking out into a hallway. The dimly lit hallway occupies the center of the frame, receding into the background to create significant depth. In the bottom-left foreground, the dark silhouette of a houseplant is visible next to the edge of what appears to be a bed. The right side of the frame is also defined by a dark foreground wall, creating a narrow view of the hall. A faintly illuminated white door is positioned in the center background at the far end of the hallway. A square panel is mounted on the right wall in the middle ground. The camera remains stationary at a medium height.",
