    "pre_caption": "This video uses a close-up shot of the scenery, focusing on a cluster of red maple leaves. The leaves are positioned in the left and center of the frame, occupying the foreground, while the softly blurred green and brown forest elements fill the background, mainly on the right and upper portions of the frame. The camera is at approximately the same height as the leaves, capturing them at eye level. Throughout the video, the leaves gently sway in place, but their spatial position within the frame remains consistent, with no significant camera movement or change in shot size. The depth is emphasized by the sharp focus on the foreground leaves and the blurred background, creating a clear separation between the two planes.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a close-up shot of vibrant red maple leaves with intricate, pointed shapes, gently swaying in the wind. Set against a softly blurred background of green and brown hues, the focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the contrast and harmony of colors. This creates a serene and immersive experience, emphasizing the beauty and tranquility of the natural setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting in a lush, green forest during the daytime. The scene features vibrant red maple leaves in the foreground, their pointed, delicate shapes contrasting against the blurred background of green foliage and tree trunks. The leaves exhibit a smooth texture, with some light filtering through, highlighting their vivid color.  Leaves in both the foreground and background gently sway in the breeze, adding a dynamic element to the serene natural environment. The calm and peaceful atmosphere is undisturbed by weather, and the focus on the leaves suggests a close-up view, emphasizing the natural beauty and detail of the foliage within the broader forest setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the scenery.",
