    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with dark skin and braided hair holds onto two thick, white ropes with her arms outstretched and jumps, causing the camera to move around her. She is wearing a textured, light-colored sleeveless dress over a white spaghetti strap top, red leggings, and gold shoes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A person holding two thick, white, twisted ropes over a dry, grassy landscape. The ground below consists of light brown dirt and sparse, yellowish vegetation under a bright daytime sky. The camera, possibly fixed on the rope that the woman is jumping, cranes 360 degrees around her, starting and ending with an upside-down view, with the person remaining centered between the ropes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera begins above the human subject and arcs around the human 360 degree and ends still above the human.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a woman is centered in the frame, viewed from directly above. Two thick, white ropes extend from the top of the frame in the foreground to her outstretched hands in the middle ground, with a dry, grassy landscape visible in the background below her. The camera then performs a 360-degree rotation around the woman, who remains consistently in the center of the frame. During this rotation, the background transitions from the ground below to a blue sky with clouds. The shot concludes with the woman inverted in the center of the frame, with the sky now occupying the bottom half of the frame and the ground the top half, as the camera remains positioned above her.",
