    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an abandoned building corridor, capturing the full length and breadth of the hallway. The camera remains at eye level, providing a consistent perspective throughout the sequence. Initially, a large pile of wooden debris occupies the foreground, positioned centrally in the lower part of the frame. As the camera moves forward, this debris shifts from the foreground to the middle ground. The walls, covered in graffiti, span the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background. The graffiti is prominently displayed in the middle ground, with some parts closer to the camera and others further away. Large windows line the right side of the frame, starting from the middle ground and continuing into the background, allowing natural light to enter. Outside the windows, dense green trees are visible in the background, occupying the right side of the frame. The floor, littered with debris, runs along the bottom of the frame from the foreground to the background. The hallway stretches into the distance, with a faint light source visible at the far end, positioned at the center of the frame in the background. The camera maintains a steady forward movement, keeping all elements consistently framed while gradually revealing more of the corridor's length.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is an interior scenery shot of an abandoned building corridor. The focus is on the environment, characterized by decaying walls with peeling paint and graffiti, and a floor littered with debris. Large windows line one side, allowing natural light to illuminate the space and reveal overgrown vegetation outside. The atmosphere conveys a sense of neglect and passage of time, emphasizing the scale and condition of the corridor rather than any specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone begins by noting a large pile of wooden debris obstructing the path, which the drone subsequently flies over. The footage reveals a long, dilapidated hallway inside an abandoned building. The walls are covered in graffiti of various colors, including green, black, and purple. Debris, consisting of broken wood and concrete, litters the floor. A row of large windows lines the right side of the hallway, offering a view of dense green trees outside. The hallway stretches into the distance, with a faint light visible at the far end.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
