    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a person on a hoverboard, dressed in a white vest, white pants, and a white hat, as they skillfully jump from the air onto the bridge's road railing and then onto the road itself, navigating through the traffic. The bridge is structured with a central car lane and pedestrian and bicycle lanes on either side. The traffic includes red, purple, and black sports cars, black sedans, and black tricycles. The scene is dynamic, highlighting the hoverboarder's impressive maneuvers amidst the bustling vehicles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A fast-paced scene unfolds on London's Tower Bridge during a sunny late afternoon. The camera moves at high speed along the roadway, capturing traffic that includes a red sports car, a black sedan, and a futuristic purple vehicle. The iconic stone towers and blue steel suspension structure of the bridge dominate the view, with the River Thames visible on the side. In the background, the modern London skyline can be seen under a partly cloudy sky. Pedestrians are present on the walkway alongside the road, and long shadows stretch across the pavement.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to frame the main subject, a person on a hoverboard, along with multiple vehicles and the structure of Tower Bridge. Initially, the hoverboarder is positioned in the middle ground, starting near the left side of the frame and elevated above the road as they jump onto the bridge\u2019s road railing. The camera, at the subject\u2019s height, tracks the hoverboarder\u2019s movement as they transition from the railing to the road, shifting their 2D position from left to center and then toward the right side of the frame, while moving from the middle ground to the foreground. Vehicles, including red, purple, and black cars, occupy the lower center and right foreground, with some extending into the middle ground. The bridge\u2019s towers and suspension elements dominate the background, spanning the upper and central portions of the frame, while pedestrians are visible in the background on the far left and right edges. Throughout the sequence, the camera maintains a dynamic, forward-moving perspective at road level, following the hoverboarder\u2019s path and capturing the shifting spatial relationships between the subject, vehicles, and bridge architecture.",
