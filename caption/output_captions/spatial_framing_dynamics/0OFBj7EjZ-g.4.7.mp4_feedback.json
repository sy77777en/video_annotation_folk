    "pre_caption": "The computer-generated video maintains a static, high-angle shot focused on a cylindrical device positioned slightly left of the frame's center in the middle ground. The background is a dark, gridded space, while the foreground features a pink diagonal line extending from the bottom left and a light green diagonal line from the bottom right, both crossing in front of the central structure. The action, presented in reverse, shows numerous small, transparent shards moving inward from off-screen in all directions, converging in the middle ground to reassemble a transparent shell around the central column. Simultaneously, on the right side of the frame, two long, transparent rectangular fragments appear in the middle ground and move toward each other to form a single vertical piece.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, presented in reverse, begins with a clear scene devoid of fragments. Gradually, numerous small, sharp-edged transparent shards move into the frame, reassembling themselves onto the exterior of a transparent cylindrical shell that encases a glowing turquoise column. This column connects a wide, light-gray circular base and a matching circular top. Two long, thin, vertically oriented rectangular pieces, made of the same transparent material, appear to the right of the central structure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an abstract, dark space with a faint grid and star-like dots, a central turquoise cylinder stands on a light gray circular base and is capped by a similar disc. A transparent, glass-like cylinder surrounding this structure partially reassembles as broken pieces move inward from off-screen. Two additional fragments enter into the right side of the frame and merge into a single piece. Two thin diagonal lines, one pink and one light green, cross the scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is computer-generated. In the center of the frame, there is a cylindrical-like device that simulates the process of partial glass repair; finally, it produces two pieces of glass on the right side of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
