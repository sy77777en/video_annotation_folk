    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot of a humanoid figure positioned on the left side of the frame in the foreground, seated at a wooden desk that occupies the bottom foreground. A computer monitor displaying code is in the center-right middle ground, with a keyboard directly in front of it in the center foreground. To the left of the monitor, in the middle ground, are a computer tower and a speaker. A cylindrical object is visible on the far right in the middle ground.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a humanoid figure lacking facial features, positioned at the far left of the frame. The figure has brown hair and light skin, wearing a dark grey shirt, and is seated at a wooden desk, typing on a black keyboard. The figure faces a black computer monitor displaying lines of white code on a dark background. To the left of the monitor is a black computer tower with a glowing blue light, and a black speaker is visible to the right of the tower. The scene is dimly lit with a reddish hue. Overlay text in the upper right corner reads \"Fictional address.\" The camera first moves backward, then tilts downward, and subsequently moves downward to focus on a brown, rectangular cardboard box on the wooden floor. A white rectangular shipping label is affixed to the box, featuring black text, a barcode, and a \"P\" logo for Priority Mail. The label indicates \"PRIORITY MAIL 2-DAY\" and shows the sender as \"David Pokora, 2597 Hensall St, MISSISSAUGA, ONTARIO\" and the recipient as \"Justin May, 123 MAPLE DRIVE, WILMINGTON DE 19801.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins in a dimly lit room, focusing on a mannequin-like figure with brown hair sitting at a light brown wooden desk and typing on a black keyboard, some keys of which are lit green. A black computer monitor on the desk displays white lines of code against a dark background. Overlay text labeled \"Fictional address\" appears in the upper right corner, and another overlay text labeled \"[9]\" is in the lower left corner. To the left of the monitor, a black computer tower with a glowing blue light and an attached yellow sticky note stands beside a black speaker. A blue and silver cylindrical object is positioned to the right of the monitor. The camera then moves backward, tilts down, and finally moves downward, shifting focus to a cardboard box on the floor. An overlay of a white shipping label with black text, tinged red by the ambient lighting, is prominent on the box. This label details \"PRIORITY MAIL 2-DAY,\" with sender \"David Pokora\" in Mississauga, Ontario, and recipient \"Justin May\" in Wilmington, DE, dated \"12/19/2016,\" and includes a USPS tracking number.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video first focuses on a humanoid subject using a computer, then shifts to a cardboard box on the floor. It begins with a close-up of the humanoid subject, with the computer screen fully visible. The camera then tilts downward and moves downward, revealing a close-up of a cardboard box on the floor with a shipping label.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to above the subject.",
