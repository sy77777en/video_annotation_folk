    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures an urban environment with a focus on the architectural elements and the overall atmosphere of the city. The camera work highlights the scale and layout of the city, showcasing a prominent building with a dome and a tall spire, as well as surrounding structures. The emphasis is on the interplay of light and shadow across the buildings, with the distant hills and a body of water adding depth to the scene. The lack of a specific main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the broader cityscape and its ambiance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a drone POV showing an aerial view of a small urban area during the day. The setting features a mix of historic and modern architecture, with prominent buildings including a multi-story structure with arched windows and a dome, and a tall, pointed church steeple. The streets below are lined with trees, and a few vehicles are visible, with light traffic flowing smoothly along the roads, indicating a calm urban activity. In the background, rolling hills and a body of water can be seen, suggesting a scenic landscape surrounding the town. The lighting is bright, with the sun casting long shadows, indicating a clear day. The overall scene combines urban and natural elements, providing a comprehensive view of the town's layout and its surroundings.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is an extreme wide shot capturing a cityscape from an aerial perspective. The camera remains above the buildings throughout the sequence, providing a broad view of the urban environment. A prominent building with a dome and arched windows is centrally located in the frame, occupying the middle ground. To the left of this building, a tall spire rises into the sky, positioned slightly off-center. Surrounding structures fill the rest of the frame, with some buildings closer to the foreground and others receding into the background. The streets and vehicles are visible beneath, situated in the lower part of the frame. In the far background, rolling hills and a body of water extend across the horizon. The camera maintains a consistent height, offering a bird's-eye view that emphasizes the layout and scale of the city. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position; the framing remains stable, focusing on the interplay between the architectural elements and the natural landscape.",
