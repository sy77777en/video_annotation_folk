    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot of a surreal, liminal space resembling a flooded indoor pool or corridor. The camera is positioned at water level, looking down a long, narrow hall with walls covered in small, pale green tiles that curve up to a flat ceiling. A series of square, recessed lights illuminates the scene with a sterile, even glow, reflecting off the tiled surfaces and the murky, rippling water that covers the floor. At the far end, a short flight of white stairs leads up to an open doorway, offering a glimpse into a brighter, hazy area beyond. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is entirely on the unsettling and expansive atmosphere of the environment. The composition emphasizes the strange architecture and the feeling of isolation rather than any specific object or character.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, is positioned at the surface of murky water within a long, narrow, and artificially lit indoor space. The left wall is curved and covered in a grid of small, pale yellowish-green tiles that reflect the light from a series of recessed square fixtures in the ceiling. At the far end of the room, a set of wide, white stairs leads up to an open doorway. The camera pans leftward, while gentle ripples naturally form in the dark water that fills the lower half of the sterile, tiled environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, static scenery shot captured from a low-angle perspective at water level. The murky water occupies the bottom half of the frame in the foreground and middle ground. A curved, tiled wall fills the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. The ceiling, featuring a row of square lights, is visible at the top of the frame, receding toward the back. In the background, positioned in the center-right, a short flight of stairs leads up to an open doorway. The camera remains stationary throughout the shot.",
