    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with short black hair and a darker complexion, wearing a red zip-up jacket with a white logo featuring different patterns on each side on the right chest, stands looking downward. Another man, also with short black hair, enters the frame wearing a light blue jacket with \"MYANMAR\" written in white capital letters across the back. The man in the blue jacket places a medal attached to a red ribbon around the neck of the man in the red jacket, who bows his head to receive it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On an outdoor athletics track with a reddish-brown surface and white lane markings, a man in a light blue jacket with \"MYANMAR\" printed in white across the back places a medal with a red ribbon around the neck of another man. The recipient, who is wearing a red zip-up jacket, bows his head as the medal is presented. The scene is captured from a slightly elevated, static viewpoint during the day.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of an athlete wearing red taking a few steps forwards to accept his medal. As he stops, another man in blue enters the frame as a medium close-up shot and puts a medal around the athlete's neck. \n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man in a red jacket positioned in the center of the frame, standing on a reddish-brown athletics track in the middle ground. As he walks slightly forward, a second man in a blue jacket enters from the bottom right, moving into the foreground and causing the framing to tighten to a medium close-up. The first man is now positioned in the center-left middle ground, while the second man occupies the bottom right foreground. The man in blue extends his arms toward the center of the frame to place a medal around the neck of the man in red, who bows his head. The camera remains static and positioned above the subjects throughout the scene.",
