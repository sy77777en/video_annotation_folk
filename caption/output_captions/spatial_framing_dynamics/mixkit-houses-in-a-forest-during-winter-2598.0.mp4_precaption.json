    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a serene winter environment with snow-covered trees, rustic wooden buildings, and majestic mountains in the background. The focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the natural setting rather than any specific object. The snow blankets the ground and trees, creating a tranquil and cohesive scene that emphasizes the beauty and vastness of the landscape. The presence of the mountains adds depth and grandeur, while the buildings blend into the environment, enhancing the sense of harmony with nature.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a serene winter landscape in an outdoor setting, featuring a snow-covered area with a backdrop of rugged, snow-dusted mountains. The time of day is likely morning or late afternoon, as the light is soft and diffused. The scene includes several dark wooden cabins with white-trimmed windows, nestled among tall evergreen trees and bare deciduous trees, all blanketed in snow. A swing set and some wooden benches are visible, partially covered by snow, adding to the tranquil atmosphere. The overall color palette is dominated by whites and muted browns, creating a calm and cohesive winter scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture the winter landscape, showing the entire scene from a distance. Snow-covered trees are positioned on the left and right sides of the frame, occupying both the foreground and middle ground. Rustic wooden buildings are located near the center and slightly to the left and right, placed in the middle ground. The snow-covered ground fills the bottom of the frame in the foreground, while a swing set and benches appear in the bottom right and middle right, also in the foreground and middle ground. Majestic mountains rise in the background, spanning the upper part of the frame and providing depth to the scene. The camera is positioned at ground level, roughly at the same height as the buildings and trees, maintaining a level perspective throughout the shot. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial arrangement during the video.",
