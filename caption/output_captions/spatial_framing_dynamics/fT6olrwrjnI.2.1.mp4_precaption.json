    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A classic black-and-white paneled soccer ball, featuring a small green and yellow emblem on one white panel, is positioned to the left in the foreground. To its right, two men in athletic attire are running towards the right, appearing equidistant from the viewer. The first man, slightly further back, has white, medium-length hair and wears a white jersey with black trim and the number \"7\" in black on the chest, over a black and blue striped long-sleeved undershirt, with white shorts and black shoes with white laces. The second man, running slightly ahead, has black spiky hair with an undercut and wears a red jersey with black trim and the number \"18\" in black on the chest, over a black long-sleeved undershirt, with red shorts and white shoes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds on a vibrant green soccer field, presented with a dynamic Dutch angle that adds an intriguing visual perspective. The background features striking white and black checkered walls, accented by blue geometric shapes. A large, classic black and white soccer ball, adorned with a small green and yellow logo, rolls across the field. Two figures, one in a white and black uniform with the number 7 and another in a red and black uniform with the number 18, sprint alongside the ball.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The full shot is presented with a Dutch angle. A large soccer ball rolls from the left foreground towards the right. To the right of the ball, in the middle ground, two men sprint towards the right side of the frame; the man in white is positioned slightly to the left of and behind the man in red. The green soccer field occupies the lower plane, extending from the foreground to the background. The background, filling the upper portion of the frame, consists of white and black checkered walls accented by blue geometric shapes. The camera tracks alongside the subjects, maintaining their relative positions as they move across the scene.",
