    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a mountain landscape scenery shot. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the winter environment rather than any specific person or object. The video, captured from a high, wide-angle perspective, reveals a vast, snow-covered mountain peak under a clear blue sky, with a ski lift cable stretching across the view and a gondola passing by. Below, the steep slope is dotted with reddish-brown rock formations and several small figures of skiers making their way down, while a ski lift station sits atop the peak. As the camera pulls back, it unveils the full expanse of the surrounding mountain range, stretching into the distant horizon and emphasizing the grandeur of the alpine setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an objective point of view, the camera moves along a cable high above a snow-covered mountain at a ski resort on a clear, sunny day. Below, several skiers make their way down a wide slope that runs alongside a prominent, reddish-brown rocky cliff formation. A building is visible at the peak, and ski lift towers dot the landscape. In the distance, a vast expanse of snow-covered mountains and forests stretches to the horizon. As the camera moves backward while rising, a black gondola car with a logo resembling a crown on its side passes by, moving in the opposite direction.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a mountain landscape. The video is a scenery shot, focusing on the environment rather than any specific subject. From a high-angle perspective, the initial frame looks down on a snow-covered peak, with a rocky cliff formation in the left and center middle ground and a ski slope on the right. A ski lift cable extends from the top right of the frame. The camera then pulls backward and simultaneously moves upward, widening the view to reveal the vast mountain range that fills the background. As this happens, a black gondola car enters from the top right and moves through the foreground, passing the camera's position. The mountain peak below transitions from a central element to a smaller feature in the center-left of the expansive landscape. The camera remains positioned high above the scenery throughout the shot.",
