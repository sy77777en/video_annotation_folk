    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures an urban scene through a fisheye lens, offering a unique, albeit slightly distorted, perspective of a city street. The footage, taken from a moving vehicle, showcases a road lined with a low stone wall and a park-like area filled with trees\u2014some bare-branched, others budding with fresh green leaves\u2014beneath a pale, overcast sky. A person with vibrant pink hair, wearing a black face mask and dark glasses, briefly appears on the left side of the frame. The focus is on conveying the overall atmosphere and character of the street, rather than highlighting a specific subject, with the wide-angle view emphasizing the scale and environment of the location.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person POV, as if through a character's eyes, the perspective initially pans left along an urban street on an overcast day. After panning, the camera maintains its leftward orientation while continuing to move forward in the original direction. A paved road with white lane markings runs alongside a low, light-colored stone wall. Beyond the wall is a park-like area with numerous tall, mostly bare-branched deciduous trees and some dark green evergreen trees. A traffic light on a yellow pole is green, and a white \"ONE WAY\" sign is visible. As the view moves, a person with pink hair, black glasses, and a black face mask comes into view on the left.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, eye-level shot of a street scene, captured from a forward-moving perspective that pans left. Initially, the frame is filled with a distorted view of the road in the foreground, a stone wall in the right middle ground, and trees in the background. As the pan concludes, a person with pink hair enters and occupies the bottom-left foreground. The composition settles with the road stretching from the bottom into the left background, while the stone wall, a park-like area, and a traffic light are positioned in the middle ground along the right side of the frame.",
