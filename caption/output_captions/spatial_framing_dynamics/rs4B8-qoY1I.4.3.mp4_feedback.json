    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a retro-style game. The main game environment, composed of magenta blocky architectural elements including walls with arched openings and a central multi-level rectangular structure, occupies the upper two-thirds of the frame and is situated in the middle ground. A small, magenta pixelated player character is positioned in the middle ground, initially on the left side of the central structure, and is depicted climbing upwards on this structure. The user interface elements are located in the foreground, across the bottom third of the screen. Specifically, a magenta scroll-like element is on the bottom left, containing a white abstract pixelated figure next to \"04\" and, initially, a green shoe icon below it; this green shoe icon later disappears from the scroll and reappears as a magenta shoe in the middle ground, positioned near the left wall within the game world. In the bottom center, the yellow pixelated word \"DAY\" and a small yellow graphic are displayed in the foreground. Another magenta scroll-like element is on the bottom right in the foreground, framing a red-outlined rectangular area which contains a white, abstract, curled-up pixelated figure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a retro-style game with a distinctly atypical visual presentation. The game world is rendered in an isometric perspective using highly pixelated graphics, dominated by a magenta color for its blocky architectural elements, such as walls with arched openings and a central multi-level rectangular structure, all set against a stark black background. A small, magenta, highly simplified pixelated player character is depicted climbing on the magenta structure. The user interface at the bottom features two magenta scroll-like elements on either side. The left scroll displays another small, white, abstract pixelated figure next to the white number \"04\", with a green shoe icon below it. This shoe later disappears and reappears in front of the wall within the game, having changed to a magenta color. In the center, the word \"DAY\" appears in a yellow pixelated font, accompanied by a small yellow pixelated graphic. The right scroll contains a red-outlined rectangular area, within which a white, abstract, curled-up pixelated figure is visible. The overall aesthetic is characterized by its extremely limited color palette and low-resolution, blocky design, giving all subjects an archaic and stylized appearance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming scene with a tilted overhead angle, showing an indoor environment in a three-quarters perspective. The setting is a room constructed from magenta brick-like elements against a black background, featuring two prominent arched doorways on the left and right. In the center of the room stands a rectangular structure, three cubes high and four cubes long, also made of magenta cubes. A small, magenta humanoid figure is depicted climbing up the side of this central structure. Overlay elements are visible at the bottom of the screen: on the left, a magenta scroll contains a white stick figure icon next to \"04\" and a green item icon below; in the center, the yellow text \"DAY\" is displayed with white text \"00\" below it, flanked by elements that are part of the magenta scroll; and on the right, another magenta scroll frames a red rectangular outline containing an animated white shape.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It appears to be a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
