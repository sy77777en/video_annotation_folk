    "pre_caption": "The video uses an extreme wide shot to capture a broad aerial view of a cityscape and its surrounding countryside. In the frame, clusters of mid-rise apartment buildings and industrial structures are positioned mostly in the lower and middle sections, occupying the foreground and middle ground, while open fields, roads, and railways extend from the center to the upper portions of the frame, reaching into the background. Patches of greenery and wooded areas are interspersed throughout, with green spaces appearing in both the foreground and background, often to the left and right sides. The overcast sky dominates the top third of the frame, forming the background above the horizon. The camera is positioned high above the scene, looking down from an elevated, almost top-down angle, which emphasizes the scale and spatial relationships between the built and natural elements. There are no major subjects or individuals present, and the shot remains static, with no significant changes in framing or spatial arrangement throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a broad aerial view of an urban area interspersed with patches of greenery and open fields. The scene features clusters of mid-rise apartment buildings, industrial structures, and a network of roads and railways, all set beneath a thick, overcast sky that casts a muted light over the landscape. The focus is on the expansive environment and the relationship between the built and natural elements, rather than on any specific object or individual, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere of the city as a whole rather than highlighting a main subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows an expansive outdoor landscape under an overcast sky, with thick gray clouds covering much of the horizon. The setting includes a mix of urban and rural environments, featuring clusters of rectangular apartment buildings with flat roofs and light-colored facades, interspersed with patches of trees and green spaces. Roads and railways cut through the scene, connecting the residential area to open fields and industrial structures with large, flat roofs and cylindrical tanks. The surrounding countryside consists of wide, grassy fields and scattered wooded areas, stretching into the distance. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by greens, grays, and browns, with no visible overlays or text elements present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
