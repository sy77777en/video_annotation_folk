    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases an animated silhouette of a person with a round head and no facial features, entirely black against a stark white background. At one point, the figure holds a brown briefcase in their right hand while their left arm hangs naturally by their side, appearing to walk with one leg slightly bent forward. In another scene, the person stands upright with arms crossed over their chest, conveying stillness. The simplicity of the silhouette highlights the figure's posture and the briefcase as key visual elements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a minimalist outdoor setting with a stark white background and a simple horizontal line suggesting the ground. Sparse green grass blades are visible, adding subtle texture to the scene. The time of day is indeterminate due to the lack of shadows or lighting cues. A silhouetted figure, characterized by a smooth, featureless black shape, is present, holding a brown briefcase. The figure's movement is implied by its changing posture, suggesting a transition from walking to standing still. The overall scene is uncluttered, focusing on the contrast between the black silhouette and the white background.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a silhouetted figure against a stark white background. Initially, the figure is positioned in the center of the frame, moving horizontally from left to right. It holds a brown briefcase in its right hand, with the left arm hanging by its side. The figure occupies the foreground, with sparse green grass blades scattered along the bottom edge of the frame, indicating the ground level. As the figure progresses, it stops near the right side of the frame, transitioning from a walking posture to a stationary stance. In this new position, the figure stands upright with arms crossed over its chest. Throughout the sequence, the camera remains at the subject's height, maintaining a consistent perspective. The spatial dynamics shift from a dynamic walking motion across the center to a static pose on the right, emphasizing the change in action without altering the shot size or camera angle.",
