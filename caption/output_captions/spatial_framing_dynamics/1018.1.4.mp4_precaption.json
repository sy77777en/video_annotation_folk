    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two men in a room. The main subject is a man wearing a white short-sleeved shirt, a dark vest with gold buttons, and a green cap with red text. He has a mustache, and is wearing a watch on his left hand. The secondary subject is a man in a dark suit with a white shirt and tie, wearing a red Santa hat. He holds a large bag and an umbrella. The main subject then takes the umbrella from him. The two men are positioned close to each other, with the main subject in the foreground and the secondary subject slightly behind him. The interaction suggests a dynamic between them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a compact, utilitarian kitchen area on a train, with muted green walls and metal cabinets. Natural daylight streams in through a window on the right side, indicating it is daytime, and the subtle changes in lighting suggest the train is in motion. The environment includes a countertop with various kitchen items like plates and a kettle, indicating a functional space. The scene features two individuals, one wearing a Santa hat, adding a festive touch. The other person is dressed in a uniform with a vest and tie, suggesting a formal or professional context. The overall atmosphere is calm, with no visible movement or changes in the setting aside from the gentle motion of the train.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of two men in a compact kitchen area on a train, with the camera positioned at their eye level. Initially, the main subject, a man in a white shirt, dark vest, and green cap, stands in the foreground on the right side of the frame. The secondary subject, a man in a dark suit and Santa hat holding a bag and an umbrella, is positioned slightly behind and to the left. As the video progresses, the main subject moves closer to the center of the frame while taking the umbrella from the secondary subject, who then turns away and exits towards the left background. The kitchen setting remains consistent throughout, with muted green walls, metal cabinets, and a window on the right side allowing natural light to enter. The countertop with kitchen items occupies the middle ground, maintaining its position relative to the subjects. The camera captures the interaction without noticeable changes in angle or zoom, focusing on the exchange between the two men.",
