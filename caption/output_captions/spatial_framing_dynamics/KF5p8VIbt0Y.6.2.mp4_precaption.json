    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up shot of illuminated neon signage at night, capturing the glowing letters and decorative lights against a dark, rainy urban backdrop. The camera initially moves through the neon sign and then shifts its focus to a glass skylight positioned behind and below the sign. Adopting a high-angle perspective, it looks through the skylight to capture the scene below, which shows several tables and a light-haired woman sitting by one of them. The video concludes with a rack focus that artfully blurs the image, transitioning smoothly out of the shot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows an outdoor urban environment at night, featuring illuminated neon signage with bold, curved letters in white and outlined bulbs, suspended against a dark backdrop. The camera gradually moves and transitions to focus on a glass skylight behind the signage under heavy rain, with water streaks visible as diagonal lines. The overall style is monochromatic, with high contrast between the bright neon lights and the surrounding darkness, and the bright inside of the skylight and the surrounding darkness. The rain creates a textured, misty effect across the scene. No overlays such as text, icons, or watermarks are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of neon signage occupying most of the frame, positioned centrally in the foreground, with the illuminated letters and decorative bulbs clearly visible against a dark, rainy background. The camera, placed at a height slightly above the sign, moves forward through the neon letters, transitioning its focus to a glass skylight that is situated behind and below the sign, now occupying the center of the frame in the middle ground. The camera adopts a high-angle perspective, looking down through the skylight, with rain streaks visible diagonally across the scene. The shot concludes with a rack focus that gradually blurs the entire image, maintaining the skylight in the center as the primary element while the background and rain become indistinct. No major human subjects are present; the focus remains on the spatial arrangement and movement between the neon sign and the skylight within the urban night setting.",
