    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features several small, boxy cars with simple, angular shapes and solid colors such as white, black, and gray. These cars have minimal detailing, with flat surfaces and basic windows, and they appear to be made from a material resembling painted cardboard or plastic. The cars are positioned on a wide, flat surface. Orange traffic cones with white stripes are also present, most of them arranged in a line near a tunnel. The overall appearance of the vehicles and objects suggests they are part of a miniature or model scene rather than full-sized, real-world subjects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors along a wide, multi-lane road bordered by a tall stone wall with a textured, block-like pattern. Several small, boxy vehicles in muted colors such as white, gray, and black travel along the road, spaced apart from each other. On one side of the road, a row of evenly spaced, slender trees stands behind a chain-link fence, and in the background, faint outlines of larger buildings are visible. The weather appears clear, with no visible precipitation or wet surfaces. The scene also features a large arched gateway built into the stone wall, and a series of orange traffic cones arranged in a line near the entrance, suggesting a controlled or restricted area. The overall color palette is subdued, with grays and browns dominating the environment. No overlay elements such as text or icons are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing several small, boxy cars and orange traffic cones spread across a broad, flat road. The cars are distributed from the left to the right side of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground, with some cars closer to the bottom left and bottom right, and others positioned more centrally. The orange traffic cones are mainly grouped in a line near the arched tunnel entrance, which is located toward the left and center of the frame in the middle ground. The tall stone wall runs horizontally across the middle and background, with a row of slender trees and a chain-link fence positioned along the top edge of the wall in the background, spanning the upper part of the frame. The camera is positioned above the scene, looking down at the cars, cones, and road, providing a clear view of the spatial arrangement and depth of all elements. There are no significant movements or changes in shot size or subject position between the two frames shown.",
