    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A humanoid figure with a golden head and a floating, fiery orb above it is depicted wearing a brown tunic and dark-blue pants. This character is shown holding two glowing, red-bladed weapons. Suspended from above are multiple light-blue, spiked balls attached to chains.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile, is set within a dark, cavernous environment with a hazy, reddish-brown background. The scene is composed of dark green and brown stone-like structures, including several platforms. Swinging from the ceiling on chains are multiple light-blue, spiked balls. On a lower platform, a row of sharp, upward-pointing spikes is visible. A character creates a burst of red and white particle effects in the center of the scene. Overlay elements are present on the screen: the bottom-left corner displays a green health bar, ability icons, and numbers; the bottom-right corner features a minimap, a blue orb count of 12, and a gold coin count of 2795; and the right side shows a pause timer reading \"1m 06s.\"**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide, side-view shot frames the action from a level perspective. Initially, a humanoid character occupies the center of the frame, standing on a middle-ground platform. In the upper half of the frame, also in the middle ground, several spiked balls swing from chains. The scene includes additional platforms in the lower left and lower right, with the right platform featuring a row of spikes. In the foreground, UI elements are positioned in the bottom-left, bottom-right, and right-side corners against a hazy background. The character, surrounded by particle effects, jumps up and to the right, moving from the center to the upper right quadrant of the frame and passing above the spiked platform below. The camera remains static throughout this movement.",
