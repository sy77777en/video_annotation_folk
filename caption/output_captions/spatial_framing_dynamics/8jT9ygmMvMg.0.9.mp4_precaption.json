    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures an aerial cityscape of Venice, Italy, during a spectacular sunrise, focusing on the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the environment. The camera glides over St. Mark's Square, showcasing the iconic Doge's Palace with its distinctive Gothic arches and loggia. Prominently featured is the Column of the Lion of Venice, topped with a bronze statue of a winged lion. The warm, golden light of the rising sun illuminates the historic architecture and reflects off the calm water of the Venetian Lagoon, where numerous gondolas are neatly moored. In the distance, a tall rectangular building with a red body and white top stands out, while a crowd gathers in St. Mark's Square, adding life to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an aerial view of St. Mark's Square in Venice during a golden sunrise or sunset. The camera circles a tall, white stone column topped by the bronze, winged Lion of Venice, revealing the ornate facade of the Doge's Palace with its lower colonnade and patterned upper walls. The vast, paved square below is sparsely populated with pedestrians. Adjacent to the square, numerous dark gondolas are moored in the calm water of the Venetian Lagoon as the sun glows on the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of the scenery, captured from a high-angle, aerial perspective. The shot begins with the Column of the Lion of Venice in the left foreground and the Doge's Palace extending behind it into the left middle ground. The waterfront promenade is in the center, with the Venetian Lagoon and moored gondolas on the right and the sunrise in the right background. The camera then performs a sweeping, upward arc, pulling back while circling the column. This motion reframes the composition, ending with the column in the center foreground, the Doge's Palace in the center middle ground, and the entirety of St. Mark's Square occupying the foreground and middle ground. The camera maintains its high-angle position above the scene throughout the shot.",
