    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a person with shoulder-length black hair and black-rimmed glasses, standing in profile. They are wearing a multi-colored athletic jacket with white sleeves and a light blue and red torso. Around their neck is a red lanyard with a bronze-colored medal, and they are holding a small, red plush toy with a yellow face. In the background, two men stand behind the main subject. The man farther away wears a white long-sleeved shirt and tan pants, while the man closer to the foreground wears a red tracksuit with white stripes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a large, modern stadium at night, illuminated by bright overhead lights mounted on a complex white truss roof structure. A red running track with white lane markings encircles a green grass infield. In the background, rows of red spectator seats are visible in the stands, and a large digital screen displays the words \"VICTORY CEREMONY.\" A person wearing a medal and a multi-colored jacket stands on the track, holding a small red plush toy. Other individuals in athletic attire are positioned further down the track, and several white chairs are arranged on the grass. A portion of a blue podium is visible in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a person wearing a medal stands in the right middle ground. A blue podium is visible in the bottom-left foreground. In the background, two other people stand to the left on a red running track, with stadium seating and an illuminated roof structure filling the rest of the frame. The camera pans slightly to the left, causing the main subject to shift from the right toward the center-right of the frame, while the two individuals in the background move more centrally. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
