    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, dressed in a dark suit and hat, is on a rooftop. He handles a long, light-colored wooden plank, lifting it and placing it at the edge of the rooftop, with one end hanging over and pointing towards an adjacent rooftop. After positioning the plank, he stands on it and jumps towards the adjacent rooftop, high above the street.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This black and white vintage film, captured from an objective point of view, presents a level-angle perspective from the height of the rooftops, overlooking a hazy city street. The scene is set on the flat rooftops of two brick buildings in the foreground. A person places one end of a long, light-colored wooden plank on the left rooftop while the other end remains suspended, using it to assist in jumping to the other rooftop. Below, the street, populated with indistinct vehicles, recedes into a foggy or smoky distance where other buildings are faintly visible. Several dark utility wires are strung horizontally across the upper portion of the view, contributing to the urban atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot, where a man is positioned in the foreground on the left rooftop. He handles a long wooden plank, also in the foreground on the left. Another rooftop is visible in the foreground on the right. Below, a hazy city street occupies the middle ground, receding towards faintly visible buildings in the background. Several utility wires are strung horizontally across the top of the frame, appearing in the middle ground. The man then places one end of the plank on the left rooftop, with the other end extending towards the right rooftop, overhanging the street in the middle ground. He walks onto the plank, moving from the foreground left to the foreground center, still above the middle ground street. He then jumps from the plank towards the right rooftop, remaining in the foreground as he moves from the center to the right. The camera is initially at the subject's level and then changes to a position above the subject as he jumps.",
