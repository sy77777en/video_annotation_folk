    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an aerial landscape scenery shot capturing a vast, tranquil body of water surrounded by a dramatic range of mountains. The scene is bathed in the warm, golden light of a low sun, which peeks over the silhouetted peaks and casts ethereal sunbeams through a thick layer of mist, reflecting softly on the calm, greenish-teal water below. Small, tree-covered islands are scattered across the water, adding to the serene and expansive vista. There is no main subject because the focus is on conveying the immense scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural environment. The shot is intended to immerse the viewer in the serene, misty mood created by the interplay of light, water, and mountains, rather than drawing attention to a specific object or landform. The landscape itself, in its entirety, serves as the subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective of a vast, tranquil body of water surrounded by a layered mountain range. The scene is set during sunrise or sunset, with the sun glowing brightly above the silhouetted peaks and casting golden rays through a hazy atmosphere. The calm, dark green water reflects the sky's warm light. Small, tree-covered islands are dotted across the water. The view slowly tilts upward, revealing the full expanse of the mountainous landscape receding into the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape from a high aerial perspective. Initially, a large body of water occupies the bottom and central parts of the frame, with a tree-covered island in the bottom left foreground and a smaller island in the middle right middle ground. A misty mountain range is visible in the background at the top of the frame. The camera slowly tilts upward, revealing more of the expansive mountain range and the sky. This movement brings the sun into view at the top left, just above the mountain peaks, while the islands in the foreground and middle ground remain in their positions.",
