    "pre_caption": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot from a high angle, capturing a yellow water taxi in the bottom right middle ground and a white buoy in the middle left middle ground, both set against a vast expanse of turquoise water. As the water taxi moves from right to left across the scene, the camera zooms in, transitioning the framing to a full shot of the boat. During this movement, the buoy exits the frame to the left, and the water taxi becomes the central subject, ending up in the bottom center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A yellow and white water taxi travels across the water. The boat features a long, bright yellow hull and a white cabin positioned towards the stern. The side of the hull is marked with blue text that includes \"Molino Stucky Hilton Venice\" and \"Skyline VE 8257,\" as well as a blue and white logo near the bow. The cabin has a series of windows along its length, and a white radar antenna is mounted on the roof. A stack of orange life preservers is visible at the rear of the vessel. Floating in the water nearby is a large, white, circular buoy with a dark-colored base.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a daytime scene set on a large expanse of turquoise water, a long water taxi with a yellow hull and a white cabin cruises across the surface, leaving a small wake. The side of the boat has text that reads \"Molino Stucky Hilton Venice,\" \"Skyline,\" and \"VE 8257.\" To the left, a white, circular buoy floats on the rippling water. A stack of orange life preservers is visible on the back of the vessel as it moves from left to right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
