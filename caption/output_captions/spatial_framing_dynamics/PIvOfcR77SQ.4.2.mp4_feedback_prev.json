    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a snowy, forested landscape. Initially, the large, single-story house occupies the left side of the frame, positioned in the foreground with its sloped roof and dark wood construction clearly visible. The house is centered horizontally in the initial view. As the camera pans to the right, the house gradually moves out of the frame, transitioning from the left side towards the edge until it is no longer visible. The camera then focuses on the snow-covered road extending into the distance, which becomes the central element in the middle ground. The road is flanked by tall evergreen trees on both sides, forming a natural border in the background. The snowbanks along the right side of the road curve gently, adding depth to the scene. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a consistent height, positioned slightly above the level of the road, providing a clear view of the landscape. The transition from the house to the road is smooth, with the camera panning steadily to the right, altering the spatial composition from a focus on the house to an emphasis on the expansive winter scenery.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a focus on a large, single-story house, setting the scene before the camera smoothly pans to the right. This shift in perspective draws the viewer's attention to the surrounding forest, emphasizing the snowy environment and the expansive, tranquil winter landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a serene winter scene in a snowy, forested area. It is set outdoors during the day, under an overcast sky that casts a soft, diffused light over the landscape. The environment features a wooden cabin with a sloped roof, completely covered in snow, situated alongside a snow-covered road. The cabin is constructed from dark wood, contrasting with the white snow. Tall evergreen trees, their branches dusted with snow, line the background, creating a natural border. As the camera pans to the right, the snowbanks along the road on the right side exhibit a curved shape. The overall atmosphere is calm and still, with no visible movement or activity.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
