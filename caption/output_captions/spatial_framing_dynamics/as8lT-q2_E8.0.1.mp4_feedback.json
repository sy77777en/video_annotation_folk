    "pre_caption": "The scene begins as a full shot, transitioning into a medium shot as the action intensifies. Two silhouetted figures are positioned in the center foreground, engaged in a fight. Behind them, in the center middle ground, a large screen displays a dark blue background with small white dots. Elements of a city skyline are visible in the right background. The figures remain primarily in the center foreground, shifting slightly left and right as they grapple, with one figure briefly moving to a lower position before rising. Concurrently, a large jellyfish graphic emerges from the bottom of the screen, rising to occupy the center middle ground. The camera is positioned level with the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts the silhouettes of two men engaged in a physical confrontation, set against a brightly lit blue background that resembles glass. Initially, the person on the left is holding a gun and engages in close combat with the person on the right. After firing the gun, the right person grabs and discards it. Both figures, appearing to wear suits or similar formal attire, grapple and exchange blows on the left side of the screen. As the sequence unfolds, a large jellyfish graphic gradually emerges from below, adding a surreal element to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors at night, within a room dominated by a large, illuminated screen or window. This screen initially shows a dark blue background with small white dots resembling stars. Gradually, a large, glowing, light-blue jellyfish graphic with intricate, web-like tendrils emerges from the bottom to the center of the screen. In front of the glass, two silhouetted figures are engaged in a struggle at the center of the scene, which is a key focus against the bright, dynamic display. Through adjacent windows on the right, parts of a modern city skyline are visible, illuminated against the night sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
