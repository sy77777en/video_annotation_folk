    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a traditional Korean pavilion, beautifully nestled within a tranquil, tree-filled landscape. Elevated on a wooden platform and supported by deep red columns, the pavilion is topped with a gracefully curved tiled roof. Its intricate eaves and beams are adorned with vibrant patterns in green, blue, and orange, highlighting the ornate dancheong painting style unique to Korean architecture. Surrounded by lush greenery and dappled sunlight, the pavilion exudes tranquility and cultural richness. A red-and-blue lantern hanging from a nearby tree adds a subtle yet symbolic touch to the peaceful scene, emphasizing the harmonious blend of architecture and nature.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting featuring a traditional Korean pavilion surrounded by lush greenery. The pavilion, with its ornate, multi-tiered roof and vibrant red columns, stands on a stone platform. The roof is intricately decorated with colorful patterns, adding to its cultural significance. The environment is a serene garden or park, with tall trees providing a canopy of green leaves, allowing dappled sunlight to filter through. The time of day is likely midday, as the sunlight is bright and casts soft shadows. The scene is tranquil, with the branches gently swaying in the wind, emphasizing the natural beauty and architectural elegance of the pavilion amidst the verdant landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a traditional Korean pavilion situated within a lush, tree-filled landscape. The pavilion occupies the central area of the frame, positioned slightly towards the bottom due to its placement on a stone platform. It is in the middle ground, with the surrounding trees forming the background. The pavilion's ornate roof and red columns are clearly visible, extending from the center-left to the center-right of the frame. The red-and-blue lantern hangs from a tree on the right side of the frame, located in the foreground. The trees and foliage fill the background, creating a dense canopy that frames the pavilion. Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled light across the scene. The camera remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective at eye level relative to the pavilion. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position of the elements within the frame.",
