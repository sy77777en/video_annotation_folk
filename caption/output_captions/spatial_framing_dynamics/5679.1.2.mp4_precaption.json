    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a man with dark skin, a beard, and long dark hair or dreadlocks partially covered by a dark cap. He is sitting on a dark railing, holding a yellow phone to his left ear with his left hand. He is wearing an unbuttoned, red and white plaid long-sleeved shirt over a white t-shirt that has a green and yellow graphic on it, along with loose-fitting, light brown pants. In the foreground, there are various plants with green leaves. A white, spherical lamp is visible to the left, and a silver, dome-shaped structure is located in the house behind the man on the right side of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is viewed from an exterior perspective at night, looking up towards the illuminated upper level of a modern house. Large windows reveal an interior with warm, wood-paneled walls. A person in a red plaid shirt sits on a black metal beam that serves as a railing for the indoor balcony, holding a yellow phone to their ear. Another individual is visible walking around inside the room. The space is lit by a spherical white lamp and a metallic, dome-shaped pendant light. The view is partially obscured by out-of-focus green foliage in the foreground and to the sides, framing the architectural setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot filmed from a low angle, a man sits in the center of the frame on a dark railing that runs diagonally from the bottom left to the top right. He is positioned in the middle ground, framed by out-of-focus green foliage in the foreground at the bottom left, top left, and right side of the frame. In the background, another person is visible inside the house on the top left, walking toward the center before raising an arm. A spherical lamp is located in the top left, and a dome-shaped pendant light is in the top right, both in the background. The camera remains positioned below the main subject throughout the shot.",
