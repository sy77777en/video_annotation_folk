    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot, filmed at the elephants' level. In the middle ground, a group of three elephants\u2014an adult on the right side of the frame, a baby elephant to its left in the center-right, and another adult elephant further left in the center-left\u2014traverse leftwards across a savanna. A fourth, partially visible elephant remains relatively static on the far left edge of the middle ground. Tall, golden-yellow grass fills the foreground and extends into the middle ground across the entire frame. Scattered green trees, bushes, and dark mounds are also visible in the middle ground. As the scene progresses, the three moving elephants maintain their relative formation while shifting left: the adult elephant initially on the right moves towards the center of the frame, the baby elephant moves from the center-right to the center-left, and the adult elephant initially in the center-left progresses towards the left edge of the frame. Throughout the shot, hazy blue-grey hills form the background across the upper portion of the frame, with a pale, hazy sky above them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of dark grey African elephants traversing a savanna landscape characterized by tall, dry, yellow-brown grass and scattered green trees. An adult elephant, viewed from its left side, walks across the scene from right to left with visible tusks. A significantly smaller, dark grey baby elephant is positioned in front of this adult. Another adult elephant, also dark grey and similar in size to the first, walks ahead of the baby, maintaining the same direction and profile view. Meanwhile, one elephant remains stationary as the three elephants move from right to left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Elephants, appearing as dark grey forms, traverse a wide expanse of tall, golden-yellow dry grass in an outdoor savanna landscape. Scattered low green bushes, taller green trees, and small, dark, rounded mounds are visible across the plain. In the distance, hazy blue-grey hills meet a pale, hazy sky, with both the distant part of the plain and the hills bathed in soft, diffuse light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
