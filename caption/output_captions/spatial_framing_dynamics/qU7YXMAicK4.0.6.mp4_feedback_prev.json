    "pre_caption": "A wide shot, taken from a low, subject-level perspective, shows the interior of a greenhouse. In the foreground and middle ground, black irrigation hoses are laid horizontally across a bed of soil, stretching from the bottom to the center of the frame. Several wooden planks are positioned on the soil in the foreground and middle ground on the left, right, and center. A dense row of large green plants is situated in the background, occupying the top-center of the frame. The camera moves slowly forward and pans slightly to the right, causing the foreground elements to shift toward the bottom of the frame while providing a more expansive view of the garden bed and the plants in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Inside a long, arched greenhouse with translucent plastic walls, a wide bed of dark, tilled soil stretches from the foreground to the back. Laid across the soil are several parallel lines of a black drip irrigation hose system. A few weathered, rectangular wooden planks are placed intermittently on the soil bed. At the far end of the bed, multiple dense rows of large, vining plants with broad, dark green, heart-shaped leaves grow vigorously, supported by thin wooden stakes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Inside a long, arched greenhouse with translucent plastic walls, rows of black irrigation hoses are laid across a bed of dark, tilled soil. At the far end of the structure, multiple rows of large, leafy green plants are supported by wooden stakes. Several wooden planks are placed on the ground at various intervals. The camera slowly moves forward and to the right, offering a wider view of the prepared garden bed and the established plants in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
