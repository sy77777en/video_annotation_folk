    "pre_caption": "The video begins as a close-up shot, with the left side of the frame largely obscured by a dark foreground element. In the middle ground, slightly right of center, a section of dark wooden paneling is visible, illuminated by light casting lattice-like shadows. As the view pans slightly to the right, more of this middle-ground wall is revealed. A large, intricately carved wooden crest, featuring lions and a central shield with a motto, becomes more prominent in the center-right of the frame, remaining in the middle ground. The dark foreground element continues to occupy the left portion of the frame throughout the pan. The camera appears to be positioned at roughly the height of the crest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a dimly lit room featuring elaborate, dark wooden paneling. As the camera moves in an arc clockwise motion, a large, intricately carved wooden crest becomes visible on the wall. The crest prominently displays lions rampant on both sides and a shield in the center, with the motto \"DIEU ET MON DROIT\" carved below it. The overall lighting is low, casting deep shadows and highlighting the texture and details of the woodwork.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit interior, suggesting it takes place late at night. Dark wooden paneling covers the walls, featuring rectangular sections and a more ornate, carved wooden element partially visible. This carving includes a central emblem or shield with a lion on each side, rendered in dark wood. A faint, cool-toned light streams through a barred window, illuminating the left side of the frame and casting a grid-like shadow on the wall. In the foreground, a metal chain-link fence or gate partially obscures the view, adding to the mysterious ambiance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
