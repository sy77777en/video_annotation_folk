    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on a long, white, cylindrical object suspended horizontally on a thin cable that stretches across a paved area. In the midground to the right, a yellow metal structure, which appears to be a winch or launch mechanism with pulleys, is positioned next to a tall black barrier. The camera then moves upward and to the left, shifting focus to a close-up of a different part of the apparatus. This new view shows a light-colored vertical post supporting a sloped metal channel, where a black spherical object is rolling downward. A black cable is also visible, attached to the side of the post with a silver carabiner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Set outdoors on a large, paved expanse under a partly cloudy sky, the scene features a long cable stretched across the area. A white, cylindrical object is suspended from this cable. To the right, a yellow metal structure and a light-colored wooden post with a chain mechanism act as supports, positioned next to a long black wall. In the middle ground, a field of dry grass separates the paved area from distant buildings and a mountain range. The perspective tilts upward and pans left, following the cable to the top of the support post, revealing a closer view of the pulley system against the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and below the subject when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot where a long, white, cylindrical object is suspended in the middle ground, stretching from the upper-left to the center of the frame. A yellow structure is positioned in the middle ground on the right, next to a black barrier that extends toward the center. The paved ground occupies the foreground and bottom half of the frame. The camera then tilts upward and pans left, transitioning to a low-angle wide shot focused on a different subject. In this new framing, a light-colored support post occupies the foreground, rising from the bottom-center of the frame. A sloped channel is visible at the top of the post, and a black spherical object rolls down it from the top-center toward the upper-left. The background shifts from a distant landscape to primarily the cloudy sky.",
