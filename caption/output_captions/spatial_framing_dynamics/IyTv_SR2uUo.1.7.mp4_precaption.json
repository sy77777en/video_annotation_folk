    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a white helmet and a red and yellow long-sleeved top with three white stripes on the sleeves is shown from a high-angle perspective in a bright green kayak. The kayaker is leaning forward, holding a paddle, as they go over a waterfall, and are then completely engulfed by the splashing white water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot mounted to the front of a bright green kayak, the scene captures the descent down a powerful waterfall within a narrow, rocky gorge. The kayaker, wearing a red and yellow jacket and a white helmet, is seen at the precipice before the kayak plunges forward. The view is then immediately obscured by a massive splash of churning white water as it goes over the falls, surrounded by dark, moss-covered rock walls.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle full shot, with the kayaker and their green kayak occupying the center of the frame in the middle ground. The scene is framed by dark, rocky walls on the left and right. As the kayak goes over the waterfall, the camera, mounted on the front, plunges downward. The shot is then immediately filled with splashing white water from the foreground, transitioning to a medium shot at the subject's level. The kayaker remains in the center but is now much closer to the camera, completely surrounded by the churning water which obscures all other elements.",
