    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot. The scene begins with an extreme wide shot, featuring a paved plaza in the foreground across the bottom of the frame. An ornate monument is positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right of center, while a modern skyscraper under construction is visible in the background to the left of center. The camera then pushes in towards the monument while simultaneously arcing counter-clockwise and tilting up from a low angle. This movement reframes the scene into a wide shot, with the monument now centered and occupying the majority of the frame from bottom to top. In the final view, the camera is positioned below the monument, looking steeply upward at its spire against the sky in the top of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, capturing a striking contrast between traditional and modern architecture under a dramatic, partly cloudy sky. The scene is set in a large, paved plaza featuring an ornate, white stone monument with a pointed spire and intricate carvings. Towering in the background is a modern glass skyscraper, still under construction with a crane visible at its peak. The video lacks a single main subject; instead, the camera's upward tilting motion emphasizes the monument itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse video shows a city square on a partly cloudy day. In a large, stone-paved plaza stands an ornate, white stone monument with a pointed spire. The background features a modern glass skyscraper under construction, complete with a crane at its top, alongside other smaller buildings and lush green trees. Fast-moving white clouds move as the sun shines brightly. The camera transitions from an extremely wide view, pushing in and tilting up while arcing counter-clockwise to focus on the monument against the dynamic sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
