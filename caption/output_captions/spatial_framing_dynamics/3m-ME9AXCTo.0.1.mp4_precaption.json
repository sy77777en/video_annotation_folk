    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with voluminous, golden, curly hair that reaches his shoulders is shown slow dancing with a woman. He wears a dark suit jacket over a white shirt with a dark bowtie, and a white flower corsage is pinned to his left lapel; he is smiling as he looks at the woman. The woman, who has long, straight, golden hair, wears a light-colored garment and looks back at the man as they dance closely.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An objective POV shot captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective, revealing an indoor, slightly dim lighting nighttime dance or party setting where two figures slow dance. Star-shaped decorations, some glittery and others made of reflective material, hang from above, illuminated by dynamic colored lights in red, yellow, green, and blue. A prominent, bright yellow-orange light source creates a lens flare effect. The background features a dark, vertically striped or corrugated surface, such as a textured wall.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a medium close-up shot of a man and a woman slow dancing. Initially, the woman occupies the left foreground, seen in profile facing right, while the man is in the right foreground, also in profile facing left, with a bright yellow-orange light source positioned between them, slightly left of center in the middle ground. Star-shaped decorations are visible hanging in the top background, and a dark, vertically striped surface forms the deeper background. As the couple sways and turns, their positions within the frame dynamically change: the woman, initially on the left, is sometimes obscured as the man, initially on the right, rotates to become more central, occasionally presenting his back to the camera. The bright light source shifts its relative position, appearing behind each of their heads at different moments during their dance. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
