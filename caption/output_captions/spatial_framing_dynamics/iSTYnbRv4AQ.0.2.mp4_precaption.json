    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, dense crowd of people moves through a narrow street lined with market stalls and tall, light-colored stone buildings. The individuals in the crowd are indistinct due to motion blur, but they appear to be wearing a variety of casual and winter clothing, including dark jackets and hoodies. The market stalls, positioned along the sides of the street, have white awnings and display blurred goods. Suspended above the crowd are several round, red paper lanterns. A glowing green cross, indicative of a pharmacy, is visible on a building on the left side of the street.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A rapid forward-moving view travels down a narrow, crowded pedestrian street flanked by multi-story European-style buildings. The scene, captured during the daytime, shows numerous people walking between shops and outdoor market stalls covered by white awnings. Strung across the street above the crowd are several red, spherical paper lanterns. A glowing green cross, indicating a pharmacy, is visible on a building on the left. Wall lamps are visible across the street, although they are not turned on. The entire perspective is characterized by a significant motion blur that radiates from the center, creating a dynamic sense of speed through the bustling urban environment.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "A wide shot captures a rapid forward movement through a crowded street, with the camera positioned at approximately eye level within the crowd. The dense crowd occupies the center of the frame, extending from the middle ground towards the foreground. Tall buildings flank the scene on the left and right, stretching from the foreground to the background, while market stalls are positioned along both sides in the middle ground. Suspended in the top center of the frame, several red lanterns are visible in the middle ground and background. A glowing green pharmacy cross is positioned on a building on the left side of the frame in the middle ground. The camera's swift forward motion creates a significant radial motion blur that emanates from the center, causing all peripheral elements to streak past as the camera advances.",
