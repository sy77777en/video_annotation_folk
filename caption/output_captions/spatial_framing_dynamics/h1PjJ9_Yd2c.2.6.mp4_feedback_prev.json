    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a young man, capturing him from the chest up. Initially, he is positioned slightly off-center to the right, with his hand near his mouth. As the video progresses, he shifts his posture, resting his head on his hand while maintaining a similar position within the frame. His hand moves from near his mouth to supporting his head, altering the dynamics of the shot subtly. The background remains consistent, featuring a muted indoor setting with soft lighting. The desk and a bottle are faintly visible in the bottom left corner, situated in the background. The camera maintains a steady level, positioned at the subject's height throughout the video, ensuring the focus remains on the subject's upper body and hand movements. There are no significant changes in the camera angle or position, keeping the spatial framing stable and centered around the subject's actions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young man with short, dark hair styled upwards. He is wearing a white dress shirt and a striped tie. In the first part, he is seen with his hand near his mouth, appearing thoughtful. Later, he rests his head on his hand, maintaining a similar contemplative expression. The lighting is soft, highlighting his facial features and creating a calm atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors, likely in a room with muted lighting, suggesting a calm, introspective atmosphere. Although the desk and bottle are not prominently visible, the everyday environment is still conveyed through subtle details. The time of day appears to be daytime, as indicated by the soft, natural light filtering in, creating gentle shadows. The color palette is subdued, with neutral tones dominating the scene. The overall composition is simple, focusing on the interaction within the space, with no significant movement or changes in the environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
