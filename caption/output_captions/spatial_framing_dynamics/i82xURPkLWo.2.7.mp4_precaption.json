    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man with a shaved head stands on a wooden porch overlooking a body of water. He is wearing a dusty rose-colored short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants. He is seen in profile, looking out at the landscape before lowering his head to gaze at a metallic bowl resting on the railing in front of him. Inside the bowl, a small piece of white paper, possibly a photograph of a person, is on fire, with a flame burning at its center.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At dusk, a wooden porch overlooks a tranquil expanse of water surrounded by marshland, with the sky painted in sunset's orange and yellow hues, mirrored on the water's surface. In the distance, a small, tree-covered island graces the horizon. A man stands in profile, gazing at the view before turning his attention to a small, metallic bowl on the railing, where a piece of paper, possibly a photograph, burns with a flickering flame, adding mystery to the serene scene. Nearby, a portion of a wooden boat docked next to the porch enhances the rustic charm of the setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a man is positioned in the left-center foreground on a wooden porch, initially seen in profile looking toward the right. In the foreground, a bowl containing a burning paper sits on the porch railing in the center-right. A portion of a boat is visible in the middle ground on the far left. The background consists of a body of water and marshland, with a tree-covered island on the right horizon. The man remains stationary within the frame but lowers his head to gaze down at the bowl. The camera is static and positioned at the subject's level.",
