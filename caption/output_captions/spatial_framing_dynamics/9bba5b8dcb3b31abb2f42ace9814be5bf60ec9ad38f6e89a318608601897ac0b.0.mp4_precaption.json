    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person's light-skinned hand, emerging from the sleeve of a white shirt, is poised to turn the page of an open instruction manual. The manual's white pages feature numbered, technical diagrams illustrating the step-by-step assembly of a model. The drawings show small, gray, brown, and black mechanical components being connected, with some steps highlighted against a light tan background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a brightly lit indoor setting, a person's hand turns the page of an instruction manual resting on a plain white surface. The manual's white pages display numbered, color-coded diagrams with grey, black, and tan illustrations for assembling small mechanical parts. The camera maintains a close, shallow focus on the manual, leaving the hand and the background softly blurred.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In this close-up shot, an open instruction manual occupies the majority of the frame, positioned centrally in the foreground and middle ground. On the right page, a diagram labeled \"1\" is located in the bottom right, while a diagram labeled \"3\" is on the left page, positioned on the left side. A person's hand, slightly out of focus, is visible in the top center middle ground, holding the edge of the left page. A blurred object sits in the top left background. The camera maintains a shallow focus on the diagrams, while the hand makes a subtle movement as it holds the page. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
