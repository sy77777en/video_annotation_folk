    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with long, dark brown hair tied in a ponytail walks down a set of outdoor concrete stairs and then onto a grassy area. She is wearing a grey short-sleeved t-shirt, black shorts, and black and white sneakers. She carries a black bag slung over her right shoulder.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an outdoor scene at what appears to be a sports facility, possibly a tennis club or stadium, under an overcast sky. A young woman with long dark hair, wearing a grey t-shirt and black shorts, and carrying a black bag, walks down a set of concrete stairs. The stairs are flanked by white metal railings and lead down to a sloping grassy area. In the background, there is a tiered seating structure with a green-painted facade and a large, covered roof supported by metal beams. Part of a building with large windows is visible further in the background, and a tall tree stands to the left. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by greens and greys.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, where a young woman is positioned in the top right of the frame, in the middle ground, descending a set of outdoor concrete stairs. These stairs are located in the center-right, leading down towards the foreground. A sloping grassy area occupies the bottom of the frame, primarily in the foreground. In the background, a tiered seating structure with a green facade and a large roof extends from the center to the top right, while part of a building with windows is visible in the background left, and a tree stands in the background top left. As the woman walks down the stairs and then turns left onto the grassy area, she moves from the top right towards the center-left of the frame and into the foreground. Simultaneously, the shot transitions to a full shot, keeping the woman as the central focus.",
