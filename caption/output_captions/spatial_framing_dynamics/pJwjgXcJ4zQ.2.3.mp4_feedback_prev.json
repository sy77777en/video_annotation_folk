    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a narrow urban street. In the left foreground, orange traffic cones delineate a construction area. Workers are positioned in the left middle ground near this area. Buildings line both the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the middle ground into the background, adorned with numerous signs. In the right middle ground, a storefront with vending machines is visible. Initially, a man stands in the right middle ground before walking towards the left foreground and exiting the frame. Another man then enters from the center middle ground, walking towards the center foreground. Other pedestrians are visible further down the street in the background. The camera maintains a relatively stable, eye-level perspective throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a bustling urban street scene with several pedestrians and various storefronts. People of diverse appearances are walking along the sidewalk, some wearing casual clothing like jeans and jackets, while others are workers in uniforms with yellow highlights and helmets. A man in a denim jacket and cap, wearing a face mask, is prominently visible walking towards the camera. Brightly lit signs and advertisements adorn the buildings, adding vibrant colors to the scene. Traffic cones line the street, indicating possible construction or restricted areas. The overall atmosphere is lively, with a mix of individuals engaged in their daily activities.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, capturing a bustling urban street scene in a narrow alley lined with tall buildings. The setting is outdoors, likely in a city known for its vibrant signage, as colorful neon signs and advertisements adorn the buildings. The time of day appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, with natural light illuminating the scene. The street is flanked by a variety of shops and restaurants, their windows displaying bright posters and menus. Orange traffic cones line the sidewalk, guiding pedestrians and indicating ongoing maintenance or construction. The pavement is entirely asphalt, with varying degrees of wear creating the impression of different sections. People walk along the street, some wearing casual attire, contributing to the lively atmosphere. The overall environment is dynamic, with a sense of movement and activity typical of a busy city street.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
