    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot of a serene winter forest. The focus is on the environment, highlighting the tranquil atmosphere and the beauty of nature. Snow blankets the ground and clings to the branches of tall, leafless trees, creating a uniform white landscape. Sunlight filters through the trees, casting soft, dappled shadows and adding a warm glow to the otherwise cool scene. The absence of a specific subject emphasizes the vastness and peacefulness of the forest, inviting viewers to appreciate the overall ambiance and scale of the natural setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a serene winter forest scene during the day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a dense array of tall, leafless trees with dark trunks, their branches lightly dusted with snow. The ground is blanketed in a thick layer of undisturbed snow, creating a uniform white landscape. Sunlight filters through the trees, casting soft, elongated shadows and creating a gentle glow in the background. The atmosphere is calm and still, with no visible movement, emphasizing the quiet beauty of the snowy forest.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a serene winter forest, capturing an expansive view of the landscape. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. In the foreground, small shrubs and young trees are visible, covered in snow, occupying the bottom left and right areas of the frame. These elements are positioned closer to the viewer, providing depth to the scene. The middle ground features taller, leafless trees with dark trunks, standing upright and evenly spaced across the frame. Their branches, also dusted with snow, extend horizontally and vertically, filling the central portion of the video. The background consists of more trees extending into the distance, where sunlight filters through, casting soft shadows and creating a warm glow near the horizon. The sun is positioned slightly off-center towards the top right, illuminating the scene from behind the trees. The camera's height is level with the midsection of the trees, offering a balanced view of the forest floor and the tree canopy. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the video, maintaining a steady and tranquil depiction of the winter forest.",
