    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark, metallic statue of a horse's head and neck is seen from a low-angle perspective, looking up towards the night sky. The horse, which appears to be made of bronze, is detailed with a bridle and emerges from a large, light-colored stone base. The base has a curved, undulating form. Framing the central monument are the illuminated upper stories of tall, yellow-hued buildings with numerous windows and balconies, creating a U-shape against the dark sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a worm's-eye view looking directly up at a dark night sky, a bronze statue of a horse's head and neck sits atop a large, curved stone pedestal. The statue is framed on three sides by the illuminated facades of multi-story, light-colored stone buildings. These buildings, lit from below by warm, yellow light, feature numerous windows and small balconies with iron railings. Faint clouds are visible moving across the dark sky above the U-shaped opening formed by the rooftops. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANI\u0106\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" underneath.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static, low-angle wide shot, the curved stone base of a monument occupies the bottom-center foreground. A bronze horse head statue rises from this base, positioned in the center middle ground. The scene is symmetrically framed on the left, right, and bottom by the illuminated upper stories of buildings, which are situated in the middle ground and form a U-shape. This architectural framing opens up to the dark night sky, which is visible in the top-center background. All elements remain stationary, with the camera positioned below the central statue, looking directly upward.",
