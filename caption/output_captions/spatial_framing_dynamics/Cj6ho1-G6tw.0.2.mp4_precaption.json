    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens with a man on a bicycle. He is wearing a red t-shirt with a white graphic on the chest, black pants, and red and black gloves. A multi-colored helmet, predominantly white with red, blue, and yellow sections and a Red Bull logo, protects his head. The bicycle he rides has an orange frame, black handlebars, a black seat, and black tires with distinctive bright green rims. As the man rides from the midground to the foreground, he becomes more prominent in the frame before disappearing between two stone pillars. The camera then moves upward, revealing a view over a stone wall of a distant cityscape under an overcast sky, featuring various buildings and a body of water in the far background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set outdoors on a stone-paved area, likely a balcony or rampart of an old stone structure in Edinburgh, characterized by rough-hewn, grey and brown stone walls. A simple black metal railing lines part of the area. In the background, a panoramic view of the city unfolds under an overcast sky, featuring a mix of buildings, prominent spires, Calton Hill with its monuments, and the Firth of Forth in the distance. A person wearing a red t-shirt and a multi-colored helmet rides an orange and black bicycle, moving across the scene from left to right between stone pillars. As the camera continues to move upward, more of the cityscape is revealed beyond the stone wall.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The scene begins with a full shot of a man on a bicycle. As he approaches the camera, he becomes bigger in the frame and finally exits the frame from the bottom right corner. The camera keeps moving up, revealing a wide shot of the scene and the distant cityscape. \n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a full shot of a man on a bicycle, initially positioned in the middle ground, riding from the left side of the frame towards the right. He is framed between a stone pillar in the left foreground and another stone pillar in the right foreground. As he rides towards the camera, he moves into the foreground, becoming larger in the frame, before exiting at the bottom right corner. A stone wall is visible in the middle ground behind his initial path, with a black metal railing to its right. A cityscape and the sea are visible in the background, framed between the pillars and above the middle ground wall. After the man exits, the camera moves up, transitioning to a wide shot. This reveals more of the stone wall across the middle ground, now occupying the lower portion of the frame, and a more expansive view of the distant cityscape and the body of water in the background, which fills the upper portion of the frame, still framed by the two foreground stone pillars. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
