    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a single, anthropomorphic alligator character with an atypical appearance. The bipedal, green-skinned alligator stands upright while wearing a light blue, long-sleeved shirt. It has large, round, white eyes with black pupils, a long snout with visible white teeth, and a tail. The character holds a light purple electric guitar with a white, swirled pickguard. Throughout the sequence, the alligator's appearance remains consistent as it shifts positions, with the spotlight tracking its movements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a completely black and empty space, a single, bright white spotlight shines down from above, following a cartoon alligator as it moves across the unseen floor. It takes out a light purple guitar and begins to play, moving its body freely to the music as the spotlight keeps pace with its performance.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot of an anthropomorphic alligator in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground within a spotlight against a black background. The alligator walks toward the center of the spotlight, pulls out a guitar, and begins to play. As it performs, the camera zooms in, transitioning to a full shot of the character. In this closer framing, the alligator remains in the center and middle ground, now appearing larger within the frame as it sways to the music, with the camera positioned at the subject's height.",
