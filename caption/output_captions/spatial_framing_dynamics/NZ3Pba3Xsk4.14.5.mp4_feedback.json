    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a small rectangular window positioned in the left-center of the frame, with the red panda visible behind the glass in the middle ground, slightly above the camera\u2019s initial height. The camera is angled upward from below the window frame. As the camera pans left and tilts upward, the shot transitions to a wide shot that reveals the landscaped zoo enclosure. In this wider view, the window moves out of frame to the right, and the scene opens to show the garden area occupying most of the frame, with grass, rocks, and shrubs in the foreground and middle ground. The black metal staircase with wooden steps appears in the center-right, extending from the foreground up into the middle ground. The beige fence with the yellow sign is visible in the background, spanning the upper left and center of the frame. The two adults, initially not visible, appear standing near the bottom right in the middle ground, at eye level with the camera, looking down at their hands. The camera\u2019s height transitions from below the window to a level, eye-level position as it completes the pan and tilt, maintaining a stable perspective on the enclosure and its elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small red panda with reddish-brown fur and a bushy ringed tail is visible through a rectangular window, though its features are somewhat obscured by the glass and reflections. As the view shifts, two adults appear, dressed in casual clothing of various colors and styles, both standing. The red panda remains inside its enclosure, separated from the visitors, while the two adults are looking down at something in their hands, rather than observing the animal or the zoo environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors in a landscaped garden area bordered by a textured, light brown wall with a large window reflecting trees and wooden structures. The setting features a well-maintained grassy lawn with scattered rocks, small trees, and shrubs, as well as a black metal staircase with wooden steps leading upward. A beige fence with horizontal slats encloses the area, and a yellow sign with white and black graphics is mounted on the fence. The environment is bright, indicating daytime, and the sky is clear, allowing sunlight to illuminate the greenery and cast soft shadows across the scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a small rectangular window, through which a small red panda can be seen, though not clearly. The camera then pans left to reveal it is inside a zoo, showing some visitors and the zoo scenery in a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera starts below the window frame, looking up at it. It then pans away while tilting to reach a level, eye-level angle.",
