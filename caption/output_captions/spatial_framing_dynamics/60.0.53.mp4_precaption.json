    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two women, who appear to be athletes, are on a grassy field at night. The woman positioned in the middle ground is bent forward at the waist, wearing a teal athletic top and matching shorts. She has light skin and her hair appears to be pulled back. A second woman stands slightly behind her and to the right, wearing a similar teal uniform. The scene is dark and hazy, illuminated by bright stadium lights from above.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a vast, dark field at night, illuminated by the intense glare of stadium lights from above. A thick, yellowish-white fog or smoke billows across the sloped, grassy terrain, catching the light and creating a hazy, dramatic atmosphere. Two figures in athletic attire are visible on the incline, their forms partially silhouetted against the brightly lit smoke in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, two women are positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground on a sloped, grassy field. The field itself occupies the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. In the background, thick, illuminated smoke fills the upper portion of the frame, with stadium lights visible in the top center and top right. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
