    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Five men stand in a police lineup in front of a wall with height markings. The man on the far left has a receding hairline, a dark beard, and wears a gray satin jacket with a strap on the left side. Next to him, a man with short brown hair and a beard is dressed in a black leather trench coat over a black turtleneck. The man in the center has dark, styled hair and wears a black suit over an unbuttoned, bright red shirt. To his right, a man with dark, wavy hair in a light blue shirt and tie holds a beige jacket and at one point covers his face with his hand. The man on the far right is balding and wears a salmon-colored patterned shirt under a blue sweater vest, looking down with his hands clasped.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors in a brightly lit room with a plain white wall. A black height chart is painted on the wall, featuring horizontal lines and stenciled numbers that mark height in feet and inches, from three feet up to over six feet. Five men stand in a line against this chart, wearing a variety of clothes, including a gray jacket, a black leather coat, a black suit with a red shirt, a light-colored suit, and a blue vest. One man holds a tan jacket, while another holds a small yellow paper.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
