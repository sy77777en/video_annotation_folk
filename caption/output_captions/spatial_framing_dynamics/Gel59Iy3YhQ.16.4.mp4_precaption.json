    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, white, pixelated humanoid character with a round body, a rectangular head featuring two black dots for eyes, and a small red object on its head is the central figure. This character interacts with a cube-like object that initially has a purple and pinkish hue. The cube then transforms into a complex, multi-colored, rotating geometric shape resembling a tesseract, with green, blue, and yellow faces visible within its structure. On a lower platform, a small, red, mushroom-like creature with a rounded cap is also present.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile, is set in a digital-style environment. The scene features a multi-tiered structure composed of purple, blocky platforms, some of which have green, moss-like accents. The background is a dark purple wall with an intricate network of glowing green and purple lines resembling circuitry. At the very bottom of the scene is a bright magenta and white surface. On the platforms, there are several stacked purple blocks and a small red mushroom-like object on a lower level. A small, white, blocky character moves on the top platform, where a colorful, rotating cube materializes. An overlay of a circular button prompt containing the letter 'A' briefly appears above a block.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. Initially, a small white character stands on the center-left of a multi-tiered purple platform structure in the middle ground. To the character's left is a purple cube, and to its right are stacked purple blocks. On a lower platform to the bottom right, a small red creature is visible. The background consists of a dark purple wall with glowing circuitry, while a bright magenta surface occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The white character moves to the right, picks up a block, and places it in the center of the top platform, where it transforms into a rotating, multi-colored geometric shape. The character ends up standing to the right of this new object.",
