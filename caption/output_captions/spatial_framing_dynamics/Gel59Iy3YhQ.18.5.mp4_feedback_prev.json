    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot from a high angle, showing a woman in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, standing inside an open garage. A goose is positioned in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame, just outside the garage. As the garage door closes from the top of the frame downwards, obscuring the woman, the camera pulls back and up, transitioning into a wide shot. In the final composition, the goose is in the center of the frame in the middle ground. The now-closed garage and its building occupy the upper-center portion of the scene. This camera movement reveals more of the surroundings: a fruit stand appears on the left, a red pillar box enters the bottom-right foreground, an A-frame sign is visible in the bottom-left foreground, and a gate appears on the right side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white goose with a bright orange beak and orange webbed feet is depicted in a simplified, low-polygon art style. It has a smooth, untextured body and small black dots for eyes. A woman, seen from behind, shares this stylized aesthetic; she has a pear-shaped body and is dressed in a maroon top, brown pants, and black shoes. Her form is minimalistic, with no discernible facial features and simple cylindrical arms. Other objects, such as a classic red British pillar box and a fruit stand with geometrically shaped produce, are also rendered in the same flat-shaded, cartoon-like style. A black A-frame sign displays a white circle containing a black silhouette of a goose with a red line through it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a paved street in a stylized, cartoonish town during the day. A central red brick building features a white-trimmed window and a light-yellow garage door, which is initially open before closing as the view pulls back to reveal more of the surroundings. A white goose with an orange beak and feet walks on the pavement in front of the building. To the left of the garage is a small market stall under a green awning, displaying crates of produce. To the right, the street includes a red postbox, a small patch of green lawn with a hedge, and a metal gate.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
