    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of two race cars on a track, capturing the full extent of the vehicles and their immediate surroundings. Initially, the white race car with the red number 98 is positioned in the foreground, slightly off the track on the grass, towards the bottom right of the frame. The black and yellow race car with the number 2 is located in the middle ground, slightly behind and to the left of the white car, also on the grass. Both cars are visibly damaged and trail smoke. As the video progresses, the white car moves slightly forward and to the left, while the black and yellow car continues to trail smoke and remains relatively stationary. The camera maintains a consistent overhead position, providing a clear view of the cars' positions and movements relative to the track and grassy area. The track itself occupies the upper portion of the frame, with the concrete wall and spectator stands visible in the background. The camera remains steady throughout, emphasizing the spatial dynamics between the two cars and their environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases two main race cars on a track, both involved in a collision. The primary focus is on a white race car with a red number 98 prominently displayed on its side, featuring black designs on its rear and a blue \"Ford\" logo. This car has visible damage to its front bumper and is positioned adjacent to the track on the grass. The secondary subject is a black and yellow race car with the number 2, which is also damaged and trailing smoke, positioned slightly behind and to the left of the first car. Both cars are next to the track, indicating a recent impact, and their proximity highlights the aftermath of a high-speed racing event.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene on a racetrack during an event, with lighting illuminating the area. The setting features a wide, paved track wrapping around a grassy area, bordered by a concrete wall, suggesting a professional racing environment. Two cars are prominently visible, both with noticeable damage, skidding across the grass and track. The cars display vibrant colors and sponsor logos, with smoke trailing from their movements, indicating recent collisions. The scene conveys a sense of dynamic motion and intensity, with tire marks visible on the track, adding to the sense of recent high-speed activity.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
