    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From an over-the-shoulder perspective, a person with short, dark hair is seen from the back in the blurred foreground, looking out at a vast, futuristic cityscape at night. The sprawling city in the background is in sharp focus, illuminated by countless pinpricks of white and blue light from buildings and vehicles, with large spotlights beaming into the dark, rainy sky. Prominently displayed in the midground is a large, brightly lit digital billboard that reads \"OFF WORLD\" and \"30 MIN. LEFT\" in white text, alongside an image of futuristic architecture on the left and a palm tree on the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, the scene overlooks a vast, futuristic cityscape at night during a downpour. The dark, sprawling metropolis is densely packed with towering structures that fade into the hazy distance, all illuminated by thousands of twinkling white and blue lights. In the mid-ground, a large, open-trussed structure is lit by powerful blue spotlights that project beams into the rainy sky. A prominent white digital billboard displays the black text \"OFF WORLD\" and \"30 MIN. LEFT\" next to a graphic of a palm tree. The foreground is defined by the character's silhouette and the partial view of a vehicle with a pinkish-red fin and glowing red lights.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is filmed from behind a person, capturing a distant cityscape. The person is in the foreground, blurred, and visible from the chest up, while the cityscape in the background is in focus.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static, over-the-shoulder shot where a person, visible from the chest up, occupies the blurred foreground on the left side of the frame. A portion of a vehicle with a pinkish-red fin is also in the foreground, extending from the bottom right toward the center. In the middle ground, a digital billboard is positioned slightly left of center, with a large, spotlighted structure to its right. The background is filled by a vast, in-focus cityscape that stretches across the entire frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a fixed perspective on the scene.",
