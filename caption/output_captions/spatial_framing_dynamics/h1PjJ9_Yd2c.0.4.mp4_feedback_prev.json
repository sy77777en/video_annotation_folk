    "pre_caption": "The video begins as a medium shot framed over the shoulder of a blurred figure in the foreground on the right. In the middle ground, two men in sports uniforms walk from the center-left towards the left. As the shot continues, it transitions into a wide shot. A man jogs from the left into the center, briefly coming into focus before joining other players who run from the middle ground toward the background. The primary focus shifts to a man with the number \"5\" on his back, who runs from the center of the frame into the background, accompanied by another player. The blurred foreground element on the right remains static throughout the clip. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of young men are on a green grass field, all wearing matching sports uniforms. The uniforms consist of black sleeveless jerseys with a wide, horizontal yellow stripe across the chest, and black shorts. One of the men, seen from behind, has a white number \"5\" on his back and is the focus of the video for part of the time. Another man with a white number \"10\" on his back is also visible. A man with dark hair comes into focus briefly, smiling as he jogs. In the foreground on the right side of the frame, there is a blurred figure visible from the shoulders up. The men are walking and jogging across the field.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the view looks out onto a large, green grass field under an overcast sky. A line of leafy green trees stands in the distance. Several men in dark, sleeveless jerseys with a horizontal yellow stripe are seen walking and then running across the field, with the primary focus on these athletes in the mid-ground. One of the jerseys has the number \"5\" printed in white on the back. The right side of the view is partially obscured by the person the camera is following.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
