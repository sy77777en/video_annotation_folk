    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot capturing a quiet residential neighborhood, focusing on the harmonious blend of traditional Japanese architecture and nature. Initially, the frame shows a narrow, paved road in the foreground, curving gently from the bottom center to the left, bordered by low stone walls and metal fences. Traditional houses with blue-tiled roofs are positioned in the middle ground, spanning from the left to the center of the frame. A convex traffic mirror is mounted on a pole in the middle ground, slightly left of center, reflecting the surroundings. The background features a clear blue sky with scattered clouds. The camera pans to the left, revealing additional houses and greenery, maintaining the serene and well-maintained setting. The camera is positioned at a height that aligns with the rooftops, providing a comprehensive view of the neighborhood.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a quiet residential area. It features traditional Japanese houses with distinct blue-tiled roofs and wooden accents, surrounded by neatly trimmed greenery and small gardens. The scene is bathed in bright daylight, highlighting the clear blue sky and a few scattered clouds. The focus is on the harmonious blend of architecture and nature, creating a serene and picturesque atmosphere. There is no main subject as the emphasis is on the overall environment and the tranquil ambiance of the neighborhood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene depicts a quiet residential neighborhood on a clear, sunny day. Traditional Japanese houses with sloped, tiled roofs and wooden accents line the street, surrounded by neatly trimmed greenery and small gardens. The sky is bright blue with a few scattered clouds, enhancing the peaceful atmosphere. A narrow, paved road curves gently, marked with a white arrow, and is bordered by low stone walls and metal fences. A convex traffic mirror is mounted on a pole, reflecting the surroundings. The camera then pans to the left, revealing additional houses, further emphasizing the serene and well-maintained setting with a sense of order and tranquility.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
