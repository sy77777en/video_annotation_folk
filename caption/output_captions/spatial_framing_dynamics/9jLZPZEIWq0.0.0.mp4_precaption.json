    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with dark brown hair styled in braids and wearing red lipstick stands facing the camera. She is dressed in a multi-colored cropped long-sleeved top featuring yellow, red, black, and white sections with graphic designs, worn over a black high-neck underlayer. She also wears a long black skirt with a black belt that has a silver buckle, and her hands are in the pockets of her skirt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a spacious stone courtyard during the golden hour. In the background stands a large, classical-style building with a light-colored stone facade, multiple stories, and a series of arched windows. A low stone balustrade runs along the front of the building, separating it from the gravel-covered ground of the courtyard where a woman is standing. The camera slowly zooms in, maintaining a steady focus on the central figure against the architectural backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium full shot of a woman positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. A large building and a stone balustrade occupy the background. The camera then slowly zooms in, transitioning to a medium shot of the woman. Throughout the zoom, she remains centrally framed, with the camera positioned at her level.",
