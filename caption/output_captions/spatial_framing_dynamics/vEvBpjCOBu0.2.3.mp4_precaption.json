    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is an industrial cityscape scenery shot. It focuses on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the scale and complexity of industrial structures. The scene features large, metallic buildings with intricate piping and machinery, reflecting a utilitarian design. The lighting casts dramatic shadows, emphasizing the textures and geometric forms of the architecture. The absence of a main subject directs attention to the overall industrial landscape, creating a sense of vastness and functionality.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an industrial setting with large, metallic structures and machinery, likely a factory or power plant. The scene is outdoors, featuring several buildings with corrugated metal siding and large glass windows. The architecture includes tall chimneys and complex piping systems, suggesting heavy industry. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as the sunlight casts long shadows and highlights the metallic surfaces with a warm glow. The sky is overcast, adding a muted tone to the environment. The structures are characterized by their geometric shapes and industrial materials, such as steel and glass, with visible textures like rivets and paneling. Overlay text in the bottom left corner reads \"[14] ; DW News - Luther and the Chemicals Industry (2013)\" but is not integrated into the scene and does not provide additional context.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an industrial cityscape, capturing the entirety of large, metallic buildings and their intricate details. The camera remains stationary throughout the sequence, maintaining a consistent view of the scene. The industrial structures dominate the frame, occupying the center and extending towards the right side. These buildings are situated in the middle ground, with their tall chimneys and complex piping systems rising into the background. The foreground features parts of other industrial elements, slightly blurred, which add depth to the scene. The sky, overcast and occupying the top portion of the frame, serves as the backdrop. The camera is positioned at a lower height relative to the buildings, looking up to emphasize their scale and complexity. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position during the video, keeping the focus steady on the industrial landscape.",
