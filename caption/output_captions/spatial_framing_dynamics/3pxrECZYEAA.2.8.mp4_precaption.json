    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated man with red skin is shown in a close-up. He has short, spiky blond hair. His most prominent feature is his eyes, which have cyan irises with magenta circles that expand outward from the center in a sequential pattern. He is holding a white plastic cup to his mouth with his left hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This animated scene is set in a room with a vibrant, warm color palette dominated by reds and oranges. The shot begins as a close-up on a face and pulls back to reveal the setting, which includes a green and white dartboard mounted on a wall. To the right, curly yellow lines, possibly part of a sign or decoration, are visible. In the far right of the scene, a list is displayed on the wall, and in the lower right corner, there are two decorative items. The central figure has red skin, blond hair, and eyes that are bright cyan with magenta outlines and concentric circles. The person is shown bringing a white cup to their mouth.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme close-up shot that fills the frame with the central part of an animated man's face, with his eyes positioned in the upper center. The camera then pulls back, transitioning to a close-up shot that reveals the man's head and shoulders, which remain centered. As the camera moves, background elements come into view. A dartboard is revealed in the middle ground on the left, while decorative yellow lines appear in the middle ground on the right. The camera is positioned at the subject's eye level throughout the shot.",
