    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm developing over a desert at dusk. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural environment. The sky is filled with a massive, churning storm cloud, its dark purple and grey masses brilliantly illuminated from within by flashes of lightning, creating spectacular bursts of white and pink light. Below the turbulent cloud cover, a distant mountain range is silhouetted against the warm, orange glow of the setting sun on the horizon.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse sequence shows a massive storm system forming over a desert landscape at twilight. The sky is dominated by large, churning clouds that are dark gray and deep purple, with bright white and pink sections illuminated from within. These clouds swirl and expand above a distant, silhouetted mountain range. Intermittent flashes of light pulse within the storm, and dark, vertical shafts of rain can be seen falling over the mountains. The foreground is a flat, arid expanse with sparse, low-lying shrubs. Throughout the sequence, the colors within the storm intensify, contrasting with the faint orange glow of the setting sun on the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot captured in a static extreme wide shot from a low angle. The composition is dominated by a large storm system that fills the top and center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground and background. Below this, a silhouetted mountain range extends across the frame in the background, just above the bottom edge. The immediate foreground, occupying the bottom portion of the frame, consists of a flat desert landscape. Throughout the time-lapse, the clouds churn and expand, with flashes of light illuminating them from within, primarily in the center of the frame. Dark shafts of rain are visible falling in the middle ground, descending from the clouds onto the distant mountains.",
