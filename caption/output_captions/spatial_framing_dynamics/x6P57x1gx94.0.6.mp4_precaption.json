    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man skateboarding down the handrail of a set of stairs. He is wearing a white T-shirt over a black long-sleeve shirt, brown pants, and a black beanie. He has a light skin tone and long hair, and is focused on his activity. In the background, a woman with a light skin tone and long hair, wearing a beige coat, is visible walking on the pavement. The man successfully navigates the handrail and continues walking on the path, showcasing his skateboarding skills.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor urban setting during the day, featuring a paved area with a mix of concrete and cobblestone surfaces. The scene includes a series of steps and a low concrete wall with a metal railing, adjacent to a patch of green grass. The environment is open and spacious, with a few pedestrians visible in the background, suggesting a public space like a plaza or park. The weather is clear, allowing for unobstructed visibility of the surroundings. The video shows motion as a person on a skateboard navigates the steps and railing, adding dynamic movement to the otherwise static architectural elements.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot capturing the full figure of the skateboarder as he maneuvers down the handrail. Initially, the skateboarder is positioned in the upper middle part of the frame, moving from the top right towards the center. He is in the foreground, while the stairs and handrail occupy the middle ground. The woman in the beige coat is in the background, located in the upper right corner of the frame. As the skateboarder descends the handrail, he shifts from the upper middle to the lower middle section of the frame. The camera remains stationary, positioned above the subject, providing a clear view of the action. The skateboarder then transitions off the handrail onto the paved area, continuing his movement towards the bottom left of the frame. Throughout the sequence, the spatial relationship between the skateboarder and the architectural elements remains consistent, emphasizing the dynamic interaction between the subject and the environment. The camera angle and height remain constant, maintaining a broad perspective of the scene.",
