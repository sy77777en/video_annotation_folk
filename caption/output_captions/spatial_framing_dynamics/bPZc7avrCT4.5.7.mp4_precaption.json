    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially presents three men. On the far left of the frame, a man in a white t-shirt is partially visible, standing. On his right relative to the frame, another man stands fully visible; he has a beard and wears a light-colored t-shirt with a dark speckled pattern on the front, dark shorts, and a light-colored hat. This second man is looking towards the right of the frame with his right arm bent and hand near his face. The third man, on the right of the frame, is half-kneeling on the ground; he wears a blue t-shirt, dark shorts, and a red baseball cap turned backward. This kneeling man holds a knife with his hands outstretched, and an orange water balloon is falling towards the knife, resulting in a large splash of water when the knife and baloon contact. During this event, the leftmost man is no longer in view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a sunny day, on a light-colored paved surface, likely a patio. A dense background of tall, green, leafy trees and other foliage creates a natural backdrop. In front of the foliage, a stack of brown, cut wood is visible. An orange water balloon is in mid-air, and then it bursts, sending a spray of clear water droplets upwards and outwards.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features different subjects in focus. It begins with three men in the frame: one is half visible standing, another is fully visible standing, and the last is almost fully visible, half kneeling on the ground. As the camera slightly shifts to the right, the leftmost man is removed from the frame, and the kneeling man pops a water balloon with a knife.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot. A partially visible man stands on the far left in the foreground. To his right, a second man stands left of center in the middle ground, and a third man is half-kneeling right of center, also in the middle ground. An orange water balloon is seen top-center in the middle ground, directly above the kneeling man. The background consists of trees across the frame, with a stack of wood left of center. As the camera shifts slightly to the right, the man on the far left moves out of the frame. The kneeling man on the right then pops the descending balloon with a knife, causing a large water splash upwards and outwards in the right and center-right of the middle ground. The standing man remains positioned left of center in the middle ground. The camera is positioned slightly below the standing man's eye level and roughly level with the upper body of the kneeling man.",
