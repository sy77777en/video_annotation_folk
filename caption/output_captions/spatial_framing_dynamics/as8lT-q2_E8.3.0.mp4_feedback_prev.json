    "pre_caption": "This clip begins with a medium-full shot of a man standing in the center middle ground of a restaurant aisle. To his left, a woman in a blue shirt is seated in a booth, also in the middle ground. In the right foreground, an older man is partially visible, while two other women are seated at a table in the center-right background. The man in the center steps up onto a table, and as he rises, the camera, positioned at his level, tilts upward and pans to the left to track his movement. This action keeps him centered in a medium-full shot as he becomes elevated. The pan to the left brings a woman with long hair into view in the bottom left foreground and moves the man from the right foreground out of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with short, buzzed hair is the central figure in a restaurant. He wears a dark bomber-style jacket with details on the shoulders and dark pants. He initially stands in an aisle before stepping up onto the surface of a red booth's table. Surrounding him are several other patrons who are all looking at him. To the left, a woman with dark hair sits in a booth wearing a bright blue top. To the right, an older, light-skinned man with glasses and light-colored hair sits at a table, wearing a light-colored collared shirt. In the background, two other women are seated at a table; one has short, curly, light-colored hair, and the other has short, dark hair. As the camera pans to the left, a fifth person is revealed: a woman with long black hair and glasses.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a diner at night, illuminated by vibrant pink and blue neon tube lights that line the ceiling and windows. A neon sign reading \"COLONNADE\" is visible in the background. The interior features red upholstered booths separated by etched glass partitions with circular patterns. Through the large windows, the dark exterior is punctuated by distant city lights. A person in a dark jacket walks down the aisle to a sofa and then stands on a table in the center of the room while other patrons are seated at their tables.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This clip begins with a medium-full shot of a man standing in the center of a restaurant, surrounded by customers who are all looking at him. He steps onto a nearby table, and the camera tilts upward and pans left to track him, still showing a medium-full shot of the man.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
