    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Four green and brown frogs with bumpy skin are sitting in a row on a light-colored surface that appears wet due to reflective light from a nearby water source. The frog on the far left, which is large and has a greenish hue, repeatedly inflates and deflates its white vocal sac as it croaks. To its right sits a smaller, stationary frog facing forward. Behind these two and slightly to the right is another large, still frog. On the far right, a medium-sized frog with a prominent white throat sits facing slightly towards the left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, outdoor setting at night, four green and brown frogs are positioned on a light-colored stone ledge. The scene is illuminated from below by a cool, greenish-blue light that casts a glow on the frogs and the surface they occupy. The background is indistinct and dark, punctuated by out-of-focus, warm yellow lights. The frogs' vocal sacs periodically inflate and deflate.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured at the subjects' level, four frogs are arranged across the lower half of the frame. Three frogs occupy the foreground: one on the bottom left, a smaller one in the center-left, and another on the bottom right. A fourth, larger frog is positioned in the middle ground, center-right, slightly behind the others. The frog on the bottom left periodically inflates and deflates its vocal sac, but the frogs otherwise remain stationary. The background is dark and out of focus, with warm yellow lights visible in the upper portion of the frame. The camera remains static throughout the shot.",
