    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a first-person, eye-level perspective of a city intersection, with a cyclist and a police car in the center-left middle ground and pedestrians crossing from the left. The camera pans right in a wide arc, shifting the view across the street to reveal food carts and buildings on the right side of the frame, before moving forward across a crosswalk. A tattooed left arm enters from the bottom left foreground, followed by a right arm, as they lift a black camera from the bottom of the frame to the center. The final composition shows the arms and the held camera occupying the foreground, framing the street scene ahead, with the One World Trade Center visible in the distant background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is shot from the first-person perspective of a light-skinned individual whose tattooed left forearm and hands are visible as they hold a black camera. In the street scene ahead, a light-skinned man in a blue t-shirt and shorts rides a white bicycle. Numerous pedestrians cross the street in a crosswalk, contributing to the bustling city street scene. A white police car with emergency lights on its roof is stopped in the intersection, while three vehicles are blocking the intersection.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a bustling New York City intersection during the golden hour of a clear day. The perspective initially pans slightly to the left, then pans right with a 180-degree turn to face the street behind, before moving forward across a wide, paved street with white-painted crosswalks. The urban environment features a mix of multi-story brick buildings and taller apartment blocks, with a Starbucks Coffee on one corner. Large, leafy green trees line the sidewalks, where pedestrians are walking and food carts are set up. A police car is stopped in the intersection, and a person on a bicycle rides through. As the view progresses, tattooed arms lift a camera, framing a shot of the street scene ahead, with the One World Trade Center visible in the distant skyline.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
