    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, shot from a selfie perspective, shows two light-skinned women jumping off a rocky cliff. The woman holding the camera has long, blonde hair and is wearing a black bikini top. She is holding hands with another woman who is slightly ahead and to her left. This second woman has long, brown hair and is wearing a patterned bikini with red, black, and white designs. Both women are in mid-air, their hair flying out as they leap towards the water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a selfie point of view, the camera, held by one of two women, captures them in mid-air as they jump from a dark, jagged rock formation. They are holding hands as they descend towards the deep, greenish-blue water below. In the background, white surf crashes against the rocky coastline under daylight.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, point-of-view perspective, a full shot captures two women in mid-air. The woman holding the camera is in the foreground, positioned in the bottom right of the frame. She is holding hands with a second woman who is slightly ahead in the middle ground, just to the left of the frame's center. Both are moving downwards from a dark rock formation that occupies the middle ground on the right and top. The water below them fills the middle ground and background on the left and bottom of the frame, while white surf against a rocky coastline is visible in the background at the top left.",
