    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a quiet street lined with traditional-style buildings featuring neutral tones and wooden accents. The scene includes a shop with large windows warmly lit from within, and a table draped in a red-and-white striped cloth displaying various items outside. The street stretches gently uphill, flanked by utility poles and wires, leading the eye toward a lush, green hillside in the distance under a clear blue sky. There is no main subject in the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, moves along a quiet, outdoor street lined with traditional Japanese buildings. The environment is clean and well-kept, with smooth gray pavement and a clear blue sky indicating daytime. On one side, a shop with large windows and warm yellow lighting displays pottery and art pieces inside, while outside, a table covered in a red-and-white striped cloth holds various small items. The street is bordered by low-rise structures with neutral-colored facades, wooden accents, and tiled roofs. Overhead, power lines stretch across the road, and a few signs with Japanese text are visible. In the distance, green hills rise beyond the end of the street, and leafy trees add natural color to the scene. No overlays or digital elements are present, and the overall atmosphere is calm and orderly.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture a quiet city street with no main subject, focusing on the overall scenery. In the first frame, the camera is positioned at street level, parallel to the ground, showing the shop with large windows and a red-and-white striped table on the right side of the frame in the foreground, while the street and other buildings extend to the left and into the middle ground. In the second frame, the camera remains at street level and faces directly up the street, placing the road in the center foreground, flanked by buildings on both the left and right sides in the middle ground, with utility poles and wires overhead. The street leads the viewer\u2019s eye toward the background, where green hills and trees are visible under a clear sky. The camera maintains a consistent height, level with the street, and there are no significant changes in shot size or spatial arrangement between the frames, aside from the shift in camera direction from a side view to a forward-facing perspective.",
