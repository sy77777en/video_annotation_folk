    "pre_caption": "The video features a full shot of a person dressed in a white suit, standing on a dark platform. The subject occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground against a stark black background. The camera captures the subject from head to toe, maintaining a consistent shot size throughout the sequence. The individual begins facing forward, then turns slightly to the left, revealing more of the side profile before returning to the initial frontal position. The platform on which the subject stands is centrally located in the lower half of the frame, with a clean white border at the very bottom. The camera remains at the subject's level, ensuring a direct and stable perspective. There are no significant changes in the spatial position or camera angle, maintaining a static and focused view of the subject throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person dressed in a full-body white suit, including a helmet and gloves, standing on a dark platform. The individual appears to be male, with a light skin tone visible on the face. The suit is form-fitting, and the person stands upright, facing forward. The setting is minimalistic, with the person being the central focus against a dark background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a minimalist indoor setting with a stark black background, creating a dramatic contrast. A figure dressed in a white outfit stands prominently on a raised platform, drawing attention due to the high contrast with the dark surroundings. The platform is positioned centrally, with a clean, white border at the bottom, adding to the geometric simplicity of the scene. The lighting is focused, highlighting the figure and casting subtle shadows, while the overall atmosphere is calm and uncluttered, emphasizing the visual elements through their simplicity and contrast.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
