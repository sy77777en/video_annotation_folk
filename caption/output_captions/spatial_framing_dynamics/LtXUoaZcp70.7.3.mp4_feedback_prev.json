    "pre_caption": "This video begins with a medium full shot of three figures arranged symmetrically in the middle ground. A central figure occupies the center of the frame, flanked by two identical figures on the left and right. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, slowly dollies out, transitioning the shot into a full shot where the figures appear smaller within the frame while maintaining their respective positions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A central male figure, rendered in a solid, bright red, stands with his hands behind his back, wearing a long coat and a matching cap. Flanking him on either side are two identical male figures in military-style uniforms, complete with caps. These two figures, who are holding rifles, are rendered in a reddish-brown color and have a distinct, intricate mesh-like texture. They stand at attention, creating a symmetrical composition around the central red figure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, undefined space with a non-reflective floor, three stylized figures stand in a row against a black background. The two outer figures are identical, rendered in a reddish-brown, mesh-like texture, and depicted as soldiers in uniform holding rifles. Positioned between them is a central figure, distinguished by a solid, bright red color and a long coat, though it shares a similar mesh texture. The scene features a slow dolly-out movement, with the camera gradually moving backward from the central arrangement. An overlay of white text is present in the lower-left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
