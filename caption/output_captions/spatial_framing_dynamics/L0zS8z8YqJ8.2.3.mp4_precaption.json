    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on a rectangular color photograph with a white border, which depicts the interior of a luxurious, wood-paneled train car. The photograph rests on a wooden table inside a similar train compartment. In the wider view, a silver, metallic humanoid figure sits on a brown upholstered sofa on the left side of the compartment. The figure, which has the build of a slender man, is posed looking out a large window, with its hands clasped in its lap. Across from the sofa is a matching brown armchair.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins with a close-up of a postcard showing an illustration of a vintage train car interior, resting on a wooden table. As the view pulls back, it reveals the postcard is inside a similar train compartment. The compartment is furnished with a brown sofa and a matching armchair, with the wooden table positioned between them. A metallic, chrome-like figure of a person sits on the sofa. The walls are paneled with dark wood, and a large window offers a view of a green, tree-filled landscape passing by. An overlay in the bottom-left corner initially displays the text: \"[2]; Joosthaler, Anton, (1981) - Die Breitspurbahn Hitlers.\" It then transitions to just \"[2]\" before finally changing to \"[2]; duckSPLASH (CC-BY 4.0)\" at the end.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of a photo before zooming out and tilting up to a wide shot of a person sitting in a train.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a photograph, which is centered in the frame and rests on a wooden table in the foreground, viewed from a high angle. The camera then pulls back and tilts up, transitioning to a wide shot that reveals the interior of a train compartment. In this final composition, a metallic figure sits on a sofa in the left foreground. The table with the photograph remains in the center-right foreground, positioned between the sofa and an armchair on the right. A large window occupies the center middle ground, with a door visible on the far right. The camera's final position is at the subject's level, establishing a clear sense of depth from the foreground furniture to the background landscape seen through the window.",
