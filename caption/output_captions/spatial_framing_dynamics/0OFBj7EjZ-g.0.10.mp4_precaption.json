    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the size of the subject in the video. If it\u2019s not clear, describe how much of the subject is visible.\n\nNext, describe the **subjects and elements\u2019 spatial position in the video**. Indicate their approximate 2D position within the frame, such as **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, centre**. Describe their 3D position within the frame, such as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Try to analyze as many elements as you can see. Each time you mention an element, you need to explain its 2D and 3D position in the frame.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end of  this text. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes within the frame, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.  \n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scene in this video but do not capture their spatial framing and dynamics. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on it completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and dynamics in this video. The given caption is only to help you learn the video thoroughly, so don't rely on it too much. Focus on the Spatial framing and dynamics and don\u2019t write too much about the subject appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows two human-shaped subjects with their backs to the camera. The subject on the right, occupying the full frame height, appears to be a woman standing upright with her hands on her hips. The central subject, approximately 40% of the frame height, seems to be a child wearing a hooded outfit. Both figures are positioned facing away from the viewer, observing a group of colorful fish swimming in front of them. The fish vary in size and color, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The setting suggests an aquarium environment, with the subjects appearing to move upward, possibly because the platform they are on is ascending, as they watch the aquatic life.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a scene from an objective perspective, showing two figures standing in front of a large glass aquarium filled with various fish swimming inside. Through the glass, the background reveals a building structure, suggesting an indoor setting, possibly a public aquarium or museum exhibit. The lighting is dim, creating a serene and contemplative atmosphere. The two figures appear to be observing the fish.**\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows two human-shaped subjects with their backs to the camera, revealing their bodies above the calf. The subject on the right occupies full frame height, while the one in the center occupies 40% of the frame height. In front of them, a group of fish swims past, suggesting a setting resembling an aquarium.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features two human-shaped subjects with their backs to the camera, positioned in front of a large aquarium. The subject on the right, a woman, occupies the full frame height and is located on the right side in the middle ground. The central subject, a child, occupies about 40% of the frame height and is positioned in the center, also in the middle ground. Both subjects are facing away from the viewer, observing colorful fish swimming in the foreground. The fish move dynamically across the frame, adding motion to the scene. The background consists of a building structure visible through the aquarium glass, suggesting an indoor setting. The camera is at the subjects' height, maintaining a consistent perspective throughout the video.",
