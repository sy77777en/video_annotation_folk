    "pre_caption": "A medium shot, captured from a high angle, shows a dense crowd of stationary, computer-generated figures. The crowd fills the entire frame, with a shallow depth of field creating distinct layers. In the middle ground, a male-presenting figure in a hoodie stands slightly right of center in sharp focus, surrounded by other figures. The focus subtly shifts from this central figure to a female-presenting figure positioned to his left. The foreground, at the bottom of the frame, and the background, at the top, are occupied by numerous figures that are heavily blurred.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a dense crowd of stylized, computer-generated human figures. All the figures are rendered in a uniform white color and have a low-polygon, faceted appearance, giving them a geometric and abstract quality. They lack detailed facial features, skin texture, or specific clothing patterns, creating a sense of anonymity. Despite the abstraction, the figures are depicted wearing simple, modern clothing, such as a hoodie on a central male-presenting figure. The crowd is composed of figures with varied, though simplified, hairstyles and body shapes, suggesting a mix of genders. The figures are posed as if walking, but remain stationary, with the camera's shallow depth of field bringing different individuals into and out of focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A crowd of low-polygon, white, human-like figures stands stationary in an indistinct space. The figures are uniform in their stark white color and faceted, geometric shapes, lacking any detailed features. They are positioned on a light-colored, flat ground under a bright light source that casts long, dark shadows behind them. The background is a hazy, grey expanse, providing no specific context to the location.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
