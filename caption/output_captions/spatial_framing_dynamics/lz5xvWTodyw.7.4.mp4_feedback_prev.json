    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a narrow, blue-walled room with a wooden floor. Initially, a large die occupies the center of the frame, positioned slightly towards the back and near the right wall in the middle ground. The die is centered horizontally and vertically in the frame. As the video progresses, the die breaks apart, and multiple smaller cubes scatter across the floor. These smaller cubes move from the center towards the edges of the frame, filling more of the foreground and middle ground. The cubes' positions shift from being clustered near the die's initial location to being spread out across the floor. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. The window near the ceiling provides soft lighting, illuminating the entire scene evenly. The camera does not change its position or angle, keeping the room's layout and the die's transformation as the central focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large, white, six-sided die with black dots, positioned closer to the back of the room and near the right wall on a wooden floor in a narrow, blue-walled room. The die is initially intact, showcasing its traditional cubic shape and distinct dot pattern. As the video progresses, the die breaks apart into several smaller cube shapes, scattered across the floor. These pieces retain the die's original color and dot pattern. The room's simple design and the die's transformation are the primary focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a small, narrow indoor room with blue walls and a wooden floor. The room is lit by a soft, ambient light coming from a window near the ceiling, suggesting a time of day with natural light, possibly morning or afternoon. The notable visual element is a large, white cube with black circular markings resembling a die, positioned centrally on the floor. The cube appears solid and smooth. As the video progresses, the cube is shown to have broken apart into smaller, irregularly shaped pieces scattered across the floor, revealing a wooden texture inside. The scene maintains a minimalist style with no additional furniture or decorations. Overlay elements include a white circular icon at the center of the screen, which is not part of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
