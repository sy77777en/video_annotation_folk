    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a dimly lit room featuring elaborate, dark wooden paneling. As the view pans slightly to the right, a large, intricately carved wooden crest becomes visible on the wall. The crest prominently displays a lion rampant on both sides and a shield in the center, with the motto \"DIEU ET MON DROIT\" carved below it. The overall lighting is low, casting deep shadows and highlighting the texture and details of the woodwork.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit interior, likely taking place at night. Dark wooden paneling covers the walls, featuring rectangular sections and a more ornate, carved wooden element partially visible. This carving includes a central emblem or shield, flanked by a lion on each side, all rendered in dark wood. Outdoor light streams through a lattice window, illuminating the left side of the wall and casting a grid-like shadow across the room. The lighting is very low, casting deep shadows and obscuring much of the detail, with only a faint, cool-toned light highlighting parts of the wooden surfaces.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins as a close-up shot, with the left side of the frame largely obscured by a dark foreground element. In the middle ground, slightly right of center, a section of dark wooden paneling is visible, illuminated by light casting lattice-like shadows. As the view pans slightly to the right, more of this middle-ground wall is revealed. A large, intricately carved wooden crest, featuring lions and a central shield with a motto, becomes more prominent in the center-right of the frame, remaining in the middle ground. The dark foreground element continues to occupy the left portion of the frame throughout the pan. The camera appears to be positioned at roughly the height of the crest.",
