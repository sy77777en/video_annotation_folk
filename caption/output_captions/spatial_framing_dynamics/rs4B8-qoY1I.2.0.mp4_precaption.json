    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A computer screen displays a \"Privacy Dashboard\" with a dark theme and white and colored text. The dashboard features several data visualization modules. At the top, three cards display information about \"Your last report,\" \"Your subscription,\" and a \"Tip for you.\" Below these, three prominent numerical counters animate, showing figures for \"TOTAL DATA BROKERS,\" \"LISTINGS REVIEWED,\" and \"DATA BROKERS WITH YOUR INFO,\" which increase to 102, 593, and 59, respectively. The lower half of the screen contains a bar chart titled \"Listings Reviewed\" and a multi-colored donut chart titled \"Your exposed data,\" which is divided into segments with percentage labels.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a software or system interface displays a \"Privacy Dashboard\" with a dark mode theme. The dashboard is organized into several panels containing data visualizations and information. The top row features cards for \"Your last report,\" \"Your subscription,\" and a \"Tip for you.\" Below, three large numerical displays show metrics for \"TOTAL DATA BROKERS,\" \"LISTINGS REVIEWED,\" and \"DATA BROKERS WITH YOUR INFO,\" with the numbers increasing rapidly. The lower portion of the dashboard includes a bar chart titled \"Listings Reviewed\" and a multi-colored donut chart labeled \"Your exposed data.\" A cursor moves across the screen and clicks on a \"View Report\" button. A vertical navigation menu is visible on the left side of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a fixed, head-on screen recording of a \"Privacy Dashboard\" that fills the frame. In the middle ground, the dashboard is organized into several static panels. Three cards are positioned across the top of the screen: \"Your last report\" on the top left, \"Your subscription\" in the top center, and \"Tip for you\" on the top right. Below these, three numerical counters are located in the center-left, center, and center-right of the frame; the numbers within them rapidly increase. In the lower half of the screen, a bar chart is situated on the bottom left, and a donut chart is on the bottom right. A cursor enters the frame, moves to the \"View Report\" button within the top-left card, and clicks it. A vertical navigation menu remains static on the far left throughout the shot.",
