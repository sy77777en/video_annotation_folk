    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide, high-angle scenery shot. The bottom half of the frame is occupied by a body of water in the foreground, with numerous boats moving in various directions across its surface. The city's waterfront extends horizontally across the middle ground. A tall bell tower, St. Mark's Campanile, is positioned in the center of the frame, rising from the middle ground. To its right is the Doge's Palace, and to its left are other waterfront buildings. The rest of the cityscape fills the background, stretching behind the main landmarks. The top portion of the frame consists of the sky in the background. The camera remains stationary at a high elevation, looking down upon the entire scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a vibrant waterfront scene. The focus is on the expansive view of a historic city with a prominent bell tower rising above a cluster of ornate, classical buildings. The architecture is characterized by its intricate facades and domed roofs, reflecting a rich cultural heritage. The foreground features a bustling waterway with various boats and water taxis creating dynamic movement across the shimmering blue water. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the grandeur and atmosphere of the cityscape, highlighting the harmonious blend of architecture and natural elements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An extreme wide, high-angle shot captures the iconic waterfront of Venice, Italy, on a clear, sunny day. In the center of the scene stands the tall, brick St. Mark's Campanile with its green, pointed roof. To its right is the ornate, white Doge's Palace with its distinctive arched colonnade. The cityscape, characterized by buildings with red-tiled roofs, extends into the background under a bright blue sky with a few wispy clouds. The foreground is dominated by a large expanse of greenish-blue water, where numerous boats, including water taxis and smaller vessels, travel, leaving white wakes behind them. Crowds of people can be seen gathered along the promenade in front of the historic buildings. A large blue and white banner is visible on a building to the left of the bell tower.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
