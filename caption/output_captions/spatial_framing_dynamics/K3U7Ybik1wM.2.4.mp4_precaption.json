    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an interior scenery shot of a rustic, country-style kitchen. The camera tilts up from a large, dark blue range cooker with two chrome-lidded hotplates, revealing a backsplash of wavy, white subway tiles and a stainless steel extractor hood above. The cooker is flanked by light green cabinets and wooden countertops, with a window to the right offering a view of a green lawn. There is no main subject, as the focus is on establishing the cozy and well-appointed atmosphere of the kitchen environment itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, tilts upward in a rustic kitchen during the daytime. The central focus is a large, dark blue range cooker with two round, chrome-covered hotplates and a striped tea towel hanging from its handle. The cooker is set between light green cabinets with curved drawer fronts and wooden countertops. The wall behind the stove is covered in a backsplash of white, wavy subway tiles. To the right, a window with a striped Roman blind looks out onto a green lawn. A stainless steel extractor hood is visible above the range, and the floor is made of large, irregular stone tiles.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot of a kitchen. The video begins with a low-angle view, where a large, dark blue range cooker is centered in the middle ground. It is flanked by light green cabinets on the left and right, with stone floor tiles occupying the foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the background, a white tiled wall is visible behind the cooker, and a window is positioned on the right. The camera then tilts upwards, shifting the frame to reveal a stainless steel extractor hood in the top center, directly above the cooker in the middle ground, while reducing the view of the floor.",
