    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light gray sedan is shown from a high angle in a dimly lit environment. Inside the car, two people are visible in the front seats; the person in the driver's seat is wearing a reddish-purple top. A large, green, glowing, three-dimensional British pound symbol (\u00a3) materializes and hovers directly above the car's roof.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective at night, a silver sedan is moving along a dark road marked with double yellow lines. The scene is dimly lit, with a single light source casting a strong shadow from the vehicle. Inside the car, two figures are visible in the front seats. A glowing, green, three-dimensional pound sterling symbol appears as an overlay, hovering above the car's roof.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of a car with two people inside. As the camera tilts upward, part of the car moves out of the frame, revealing a floating \"\u00a3\" symbol above it.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a high-angle full shot of a car positioned diagonally from the top left to the bottom right in the middle ground. A green, glowing pound symbol then materializes in the center of the frame, hovering directly above the car's roof. As the camera tilts upward, the front of the car shifts toward the bottom of the frame, with part of it moving out of view, while the pound symbol remains centrally positioned.",
