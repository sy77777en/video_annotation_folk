    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a majestic landscape scenery shot captured from a low angle within a snow-covered forest. The night sky is dominated by a spectacular display of the aurora borealis, with brilliant, swirling curtains of vibrant green light stretching across the expanse. Silhouetted against this celestial phenomenon are the dark spires of numerous evergreen trees and the bare branches of a deciduous tree, their forms adding depth and scale to the scene. The composition intentionally lacks a single main subject; instead, the focus is on the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of the natural environment, creating an atmosphere of awe and wonder.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective on snow-covered ground, the view looks up at a night sky dominated by the aurora borealis. Vibrant green lights swirl and shift in wide, curtain-like bands across the dark sky, with some areas glowing a brighter white. A forest of snow-dusted coniferous trees, along with a few bare deciduous trees, are silhouetted against the luminous display. A few stars are visible through the moving curtains of light.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide, low-angle scenery shot is captured from a static position on the ground, looking up. In the foreground, snow-covered ground occupies the bottom of the frame. A forest of silhouetted evergreen trees is positioned across the middle ground at the bottom, with a taller evergreen prominent in the center-right and a bare deciduous tree on the right. The background is dominated by the aurora borealis, which fills the top and center of the frame with swirling green light that moves across the sky.",
