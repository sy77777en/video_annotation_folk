    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from an eye-level perspective. The scene begins with a traditional Japanese house positioned in the right foreground and middle ground. A chain-link fence is in the bottom right foreground, while a street occupies the bottom left. The camera then pans slowly to the left, causing the house to move out of the frame to the right. This movement reveals more of the street corner, which becomes the central focus. In the final composition, a convex traffic mirror on a pole stands in the center-left middle ground, with a concrete block wall and fence running along the bottom of the frame. Other houses and green trees are visible in the background across the street.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a residential scenery shot capturing a quiet street corner in a Japanese neighborhood on a bright, sunny day. The view pans slowly from a traditional-style house with a tiled roof and red curtains to reveal the narrow street, which is lined with concrete block walls, modern fences, and other homes. Lush green trees and bushes add to the tranquil atmosphere under a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds, while a convex traffic mirror stands prominently at the corner. The video lacks a central subject, as the camera's deliberate movement is intended to showcase the environment itself, emphasizing the peaceful and ordinary character of the suburban setting rather than any specific action or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, pans left along a quiet residential street in Japan on a sunny day. The camera moves from a traditional-style house with a grey, tilted roof, wooden beams, and red curtains in the doorway to reveal the surrounding neighborhood. The house is bordered by a low chain-link fence and a concrete block wall. As the view shifts, a convex traffic mirror on a pole comes into view, reflecting the scene. In the background, other houses with tiled roofs are visible behind green trees and bushes, all under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
