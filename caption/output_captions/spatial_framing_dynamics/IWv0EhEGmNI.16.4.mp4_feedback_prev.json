    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a woman positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground. She is leaning forward with her arms extended to her sides, creating a dynamic pose. The camera is at her eye level, allowing for a direct engagement with her expression of focus. As the scene transitions to a medium shot, the framing tightens around her upper body, maintaining her central position while emphasizing her face and upper arms. The swirling smoke fills the background, with a bright light source on the left creating a strong backlit effect, while a large dark structure with a glowing red light is visible in the background, slightly off-center to the right. Throughout the video, the spatial dynamics shift from a broader view of the scene to a more intimate focus on the subject, enhancing the sense of urgency in her pose.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with short, dark, messy hair is captured in a dynamic, forward-leaning pose. She wears a light-colored, unbuttoned jacket over a dark t-shirt and light-colored pants. Her arms are extended to her sides as if for balance, and her face, turned towards the viewer, holds an expression of intense focus or alarm.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark, outdoor location at night, filled with dense, swirling smoke that obscures the surroundings. A bright, white light source from the left illuminates the haze, creating a strong backlit effect. In the background, a large, dark structure with a glowing red light is visible through the smoke. A person wearing a light-colored jacket moves through the center of the foggy environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
