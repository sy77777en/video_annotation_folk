    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, green, patinated equestrian statue stands at the center, depicting a figure on horseback. The rider, wearing what appears to be a crown or halo, holds a tall weapon in one hand. The statue is mounted on a large, light-colored stone pedestal. In the background, a light-colored stone building features several conical towers with pointed roofs. To the left and right of the central statue are green, leafy trees.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a low-angle, dynamic shot of a large, green-patinated equestrian statue in Budapest. The statue, depicting a figure on horseback holding a weapon, is positioned on a substantial stone pedestal. In the background stands a historic, light-colored stone building, identified as Fisherman's Bastion, characterized by its conical towers and arched walkways. Green trees are visible on the sides, and the scene is set against a pale blue sky with soft white clouds during the day.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This video opens with a low-angle wide shot, placing a large equestrian statue in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The statue is set against a building with conical towers in the background, with green trees positioned in the middle ground to the left and right. The camera moves forward and upward toward the statue, causing the framing to transition into a full shot where the statue and its pedestal become the dominant central element, filling more of the frame.",
