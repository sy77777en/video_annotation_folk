    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a residential scenery shot featuring a large, two-story house constructed from red brick with a dark, shingled roof. The home's design includes white-trimmed windows, a prominent arched window above the entryway, and a small gabled section over the front door. A black, wrought-iron-style fence encloses a manicured green lawn in the foreground, with various plants, including a tall, slender palm-like tree and green bushes, situated between the fence and the house. The shot lacks a main subject because its purpose is to establish the setting. The focus is on the architectural style and the overall affluent atmosphere of the property rather than on any specific character or action.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is an outdoor, daytime shot of a large, two-story house under an overcast sky. The house features a red brick facade and a dark, shingled roof with a gabled section above an arched entryway. The windows have white frames, with one tall, prominent window on the left side. In the foreground, a black metal fence with vertical bars separates the viewer from a manicured green lawn. A white pillar with a dark light fixture stands on the right side of the fence. Various plants, including a tall, spiky-leafed tree and green shrubs, are situated in the yard between the fence and the house. In the background, the tops of palm trees are visible on the far left.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of a residential scene. In the foreground, a black metal fence extends across the bottom of the frame, with a white pillar positioned on the bottom right. Just behind the fence, a green lawn occupies the lower portion of the scene, leading into the middle ground. The large, two-story brick house is the central element, filling the majority of the frame from the center to the top. A tall, slender tree is situated on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, in front of the house. In the background, the tops of palm trees are visible in the top left, with an overcast sky occupying the top edge of the frame. The camera is positioned at a height approximately level with the ground floor of the house, and there are no spatial movements or changes in framing.",
