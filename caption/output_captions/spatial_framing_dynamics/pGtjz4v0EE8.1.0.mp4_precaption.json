    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot presenting a dramatic, wide-angle, time-lapse view of the Colosseum in Rome at night. The ancient amphitheater is bathed in a warm, golden-orange glow, highlighting its tiered structure of arches and weathered stone against the dark sky. Streaks of white and red light from passing vehicles blur across the foreground, creating a sense of motion and energy. The video lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to convey the majestic scale and atmospheric ambiance of the iconic landmark within its bustling, modern environment, contrasting the enduring stone with the fleeting lights of the city.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A nighttime, wide-angle view captures the Colosseum in Rome, illuminated by warm, golden lights that accentuate its weathered stone facade and multiple tiers of arches. The perspective is low and in motion, creating streaks of red and white light from traffic on the adjacent road. The dark night sky contrasts with the brightly lit amphitheater and the orange glow of nearby streetlights, which produce a noticeable lens flare. The sweeping motion and distorted perspective emphasize the massive, curved structure of the ancient monument.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from a low angle. The Colosseum is the primary element, positioned in the middle ground and occupying the center and left portions of the frame. In the foreground, at the bottom of the screen, long streaks of light from passing traffic move across the scene. A bright streetlight is located in the top right, casting a lens flare. The camera appears to be in motion, sweeping from right to left in a time-lapse, which causes the perspective on the curved facade of the Colosseum to shift and creates the light trails in the foreground. The use of a wide-angle lens results in a distorted, curved perspective that emphasizes the scale of the ancient structure.",
