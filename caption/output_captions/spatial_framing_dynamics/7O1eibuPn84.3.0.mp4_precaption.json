    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a turtle as it slowly walks into the frame from the right. The turtle has a high-domed, tan-colored shell with a distinct pattern of black geometric blotches and lines. Its skin is light brown and wrinkled, and its thick, scaly legs are visible as it moves across the dirt ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene captures a turtle with a patterned shell slowly walking into view from the right, highlighted against a softly blurred background of green and brown foliage. The low, ground-level perspective emphasizes the turtle's presence, with the light brown dirt path and sparse blades of green grass intentionally out of focus. A white text overlay with the word \"TURTLE\" is positioned in the lower-left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a ground-level shot featuring a blurry light brown foreground, a strip of darker earth with sparse grass in the middle ground, and a blurred green and brown background. A turtle then enters from the right, walking leftward into the middle ground, which transitions the scene into a full shot of the animal. As the turtle occupies the right side of the frame, a white text box labeled \"TURTLE\" appears in the bottom-left foreground. The camera remains positioned at the turtle's level throughout the shot.",
