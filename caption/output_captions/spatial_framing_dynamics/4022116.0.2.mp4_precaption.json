    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a view down a canal in Venice and then pans left towards the shore. As the camera moves, a large, passenger-filled white and green public transport boat labeled \"Actv 26\" comes into view, adorned with \"LUOGO E SEGNI.\" The scene captures the atmosphere of the canal, with various watercraft, including a smaller wooden motorboat, contributing to the lively environment. The camera continues to pan, revealing a grand, ornate white building with classical statues and a wide staircase, which has a few people on it. The shot emphasizes the comprehensive scale and character of this iconic location under an overcast sky, focusing on the overall urban environment and historic Venetian architecture rather than a singular main subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a scene on the Grand Canal in Venice under an overcast sky. The choppy, greenish water is flanked by historic, multi-story buildings with reddish-brown brick and plaster facades and tiled roofs. On one side, a large, ornate white church with wide steps descends toward the water. Various boats navigate the canal, including a prominent white and off-white vaporetto, or water bus, with \"Actv 26\" on its side, carrying passengers. Another smaller, classic water taxi is visible further down the canal. People can be seen on the boats and along the waterfront docks.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot. The video begins with a wide shot of a Venetian canal, with the water occupying the center and foreground and extending into the background. Buildings line the left and right sides of the frame in the middle ground. The camera, positioned at a low angle close to the water, pans to the left. As the camera moves, a docked vaporetto in the middle ground enters the frame from the right and moves toward the center. The pan concludes by revealing a large church with a wide staircase, which occupies the left side of the frame from the foreground to the middle ground, while the docked vaporetto is now positioned in the right middle ground.",
