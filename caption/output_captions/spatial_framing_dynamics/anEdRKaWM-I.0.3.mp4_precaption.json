    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with fair skin, reddish-brown hair, and light-colored eyes is shown in a close-up, looking directly forward. Her expression is neutral. Her forehead is partially visible, and her eyes initially look straight ahead before shifting to the bottom left of the frame. She then places her hands on the sides of her neck.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a close-up shot, a woman with red hair is set against a blurred, blue-toned background. The out-of-focus environment appears as a solid, gray-blue surface, creating a minimalist setting under soft, diffused lighting. During the shot, the woman places her hands on either side of her neck before moving them away. The camera slightly pulls back as it zooms in throughout the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot initially frames a woman's face in the center of the screen, positioned in the foreground against a blurred background. The camera then performs a dolly zoom, simultaneously moving backward and zooming in, which keeps the woman's face at a consistent size while the background appears to compress. During this camera movement, the woman raises her hands from the bottom of the frame and places them on the left and right sides of her neck. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout the shot.",
