    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black stick figure, depicted as a solid silhouette with a round head, a thin body, and large, blocky hands and feet, is shown in various poses suggesting movement. It crouches, runs, and kicks a solid red, round ball that appears on the ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set against a stark white background, representing an open outdoor space. A thin, black horizontal line delineates the ground, upon which sparse, green, sketch-like tufts of grass are scattered. In this minimalist, two-dimensional setting, a black stick figure runs across the screen, and a solid red ball appears.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot filmed at the subject's level, a black stick figure is initially positioned in the bottom center of the frame, standing in the middle ground on a horizontal line. The figure crouches and then runs horizontally from the center to the right side of the frame, remaining in the bottom half. A red ball appears in the bottom right, in the middle ground, which the figure then kicks, sending it off the right edge of the frame. The figure subsequently stops in the bottom right. The scene's foreground and middle ground are defined by a thin ground line across the bottom, with sparse green grass tufts scattered along it.",
