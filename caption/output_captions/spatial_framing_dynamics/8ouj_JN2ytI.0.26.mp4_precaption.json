    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video's main focus is a series of large, bright orange and yellow explosions erupting in an urban street, sending plumes of dark grey and black smoke billowing upwards, accompanied by flying sparks and fiery debris. Several cars are present in the affected area: a silver sedan in the foreground appears relatively intact, while further up the street, a yellow taxi cab and a red car are surrounded by smoke and debris and appear damaged. On the right side of the street, a dark-colored SUV or truck is overturned or heavily damaged, positioned near large bales of compressed material, possibly cardboard or paper. The street is extensively littered with scattered papers, pieces of metal, wood, and other fragments. Multi-story industrial-style buildings with numerous windows, some of which are broken, line both sides of the street; the building on the left features fire escapes, and the one on the right has loading docks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, a chaotic scene unfolds during the daytime in a narrow urban street flanked by multi-story industrial buildings. A series of explosions erupts down the length of the street, creating large fireballs and plumes of black and grey smoke that billow into the air. The paved road is littered with debris, including scattered white papers, overturned vehicles, and a fallen utility pole. A silver sedan is parked in the foreground, while a wrecked yellow taxi and a red car are visible further down amidst the destruction. The light-colored buildings feature numerous windows and loading docks, with large, wrapped bales of material stacked along the side.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, a narrow urban street is framed between two multi-story buildings on the left and right. A silver sedan is stationary in the bottom left foreground. The primary action begins in the middle ground, where an initial explosion erupts on the left side of the street. This is immediately followed by a series of subsequent explosions that progress down the street into the background and across to the right side, engulfing a yellow taxi and a red car in the center and an overturned vehicle on the right. Plumes of smoke and debris are propelled upwards and outwards from the middle ground, filling the upper portion of the frame as the camera remains static.",
