    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A male warrior character, clad in a red and silver top, a helmet, and black pants while wielding a sword, is surrounded by humanoid skeletons, some of which are intact while others are reduced to piles of bones on the stone floor. A large, rectangular overlay is located at the bottom center of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video shows a scene within a dark, stone dungeon. The environment is constructed from grey stone, featuring walls with arched openings, supportive pillars, and a cobblestone floor. In the upper left, a set of circular stone stairs leads up and out of view, and a small fire burns in a brazier. Throughout the scene, a character defeats several skeletons, which crumble into piles of bones on the floor, joining existing bloodstains. A stone sarcophagus is also visible within the room. An overlay at the bottom of the screen serves as a heads-up display, featuring a red orb on the left, a blue orb on the right, and a central bar with various icons and buttons. Text briefly appears in the lower center, identifying an enemy and a kill count.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is presented as a wide shot from a high-angle, isometric perspective. Initially, a warrior character stands in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, surrounded by several humanoid skeletons. The scene is enclosed by stone walls and pillars that occupy the middle ground and background. A user interface overlay is fixed in the foreground at the bottom center of the screen. After the skeletons are defeated and become piles of bones on the floor, the warrior moves from the center towards the top left of the frame. This movement reveals a stone sarcophagus in the center-left middle ground and brings the character closer to a set of circular stairs and a burning brazier, both located in the top left background.",
