    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man in a green uniform, including a green hat with red lettering, a dark green vest, green pants, and a white short-sleeved shirt. He is standing by a window while speaking on a phone and is wearing a watch on his left hand. The setting appears to be an office or control room with clipboards on the wall and a desk with various items like a lamp and papers. As the video progresses,  the scene transitions to a kitchen area on a train, with cabinets, dishes, and a window.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting on a train, featuring a utilitarian, compact office space transitioning to a small kitchenette area. The walls are mostly light green, with the upper section being dark green, creating a cohesive backdrop. In the office, a red chair is positioned between the desk and a wall-mounted telephone. The desk is cluttered with papers and a vintage lamp. The walls are adorned with some folders and a green bulletin board displaying papers and a calendar with the number 25. The kitchenette features gray cabinets, a countertop with neatly arranged dishes, and a few containers. A window in both areas allows natural light to illuminate the space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man in a green uniform, positioned on the left side of the frame, near a window in the foreground. He is speaking on a phone and stands slightly angled towards the center. The office environment surrounds him, with a desk cluttered with papers and a lamp in the bottom right corner of the frame. Clipboards hang on the wall behind him, occupying the middle ground, and a red chair is situated between the desk and the wall. The camera remains at the subject's height, capturing his upper body and surroundings clearly. As the video progresses, the man exits the frame, leaving an empty office space. The camera then pans to the right, transitioning to a new scene. This new scene showcases a kitchen area, with gray cabinets in the top left and a countertop filled with dishes and containers in the bottom center. A window is visible on the far right, allowing natural light into the space. The camera maintains its height, now capturing the kitchen at eye level, emphasizing the shift from the office to the kitchen without any change in perspective. The transition is smooth, focusing on the spatial layout and elements of both settings.",
