    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays the Greek word \"II\u0391\u03a7\u03a9\u039d\" superimposed on a textured, rocky surface. The letters, initially appearing as dark, shadowy indentations on the stone, gradually illuminate to a bright, glowing white. The background surface exhibits a layered, uneven texture with varying shades of green, brown, and grey, suggesting a natural rock formation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a close-up of a rough, textured rock surface, predominantly in shades of green and gray, with visible layers and crevices. An overlay of the Greek word \"II\u0391\u03a7\u03a9\u039d\" appears on the rock. Initially, the letters are dark and seem carved into the surface. Then, the letters illuminate, glowing bright white against the darker background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a static close-up view. The Greek word \"II\u0391\u03a7\u03a9\u039d\" is the primary element, initially appearing as dark, recessed characters on a textured rock surface that fills the entire background. The letters are arranged diagonally across the frame: \"II\" is positioned in the bottom-left foreground, \"\u0391\" slightly to its right and above towards the center-left foreground, \"\u03a7\" in the central foreground, \"\u03a9\" to its right and above towards the center-right foreground, and \"\u039d\" in the top-right foreground. Over a few seconds, these letters transition from dark indentations, perceived as part of the middle ground rock surface, to glowing bright white elements that appear superimposed in the foreground. The rocky background, with its green, brown, and grey hues, remains static throughout. The camera maintains a consistent, direct perspective, possibly slightly elevated, focusing on the word and the immediate rock texture.",
