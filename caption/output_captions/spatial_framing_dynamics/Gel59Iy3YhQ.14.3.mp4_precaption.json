    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a video game with a winter theme, two player characters are depicted as small, cartoonish Santa Claus figures. Both characters wear identical red suits with white trim, matching red hats with a white pom-pom, and full white beards that obscure their faces. They are positioned on opposite sides of a central conveyor belt in a kitchen setting. The game's interface is visible, with order tickets for various hot beverages displayed at the top of the screen, a score and tip multiplier in the bottom-left corner, and a countdown timer in the bottom-right corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen shows a bustling outdoor kitchen set in a snowy, winter village at night. The central gameplay area is a rectangular arrangement of wooden counters surrounding two snowy patches, bisected by a moving conveyor belt made of blue, icy blocks. In the background, snow-covered pine trees, large decorative candy canes, and wooden stalls with warm lights create a festive atmosphere. Two small, cartoon-like characters, both dressed as Santa Claus, move around the kitchen, interacting with ingredients and appliances. Overlays are present on the screen. At the top, a series of panels displays drink orders. A score and tip multiplier are shown in the bottom-left corner, while a countdown timer is visible in the bottom-right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide, high-angle shot, a video game kitchen is centrally located in the middle ground, set within a snowy village in the background. The kitchen is bisected by a vertical conveyor belt that runs down the center of the frame. Two small, cartoonish Santa characters are positioned on opposite sides of this conveyor belt; the left character moves from the bottom-left towards the top-left of their section, while the right character moves around the bottom-right of their section. Game interface elements are overlaid on the scene: order tickets are at the top, a score and tip multiplier are in the bottom-left corner, and a timer is in the bottom-right corner. The camera remains stationary throughout the shot.",
