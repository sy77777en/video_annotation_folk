    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective framed by a reddish-brown diving mask frame, the video shows an underwater scene dominated by enormous, tree-like structures resembling giant mushrooms. These structures have thick, mottled green and brown trunks from which protrude numerous large, flat, disc-shaped caps. The undersides of these caps are a reddish-orange color with a distinct honeycomb texture, while their tops are dark. The trunks are also adorned with glowing green, blue, and pink patterns. Swimming in large schools through this alien forest are small, bioluminescent creatures that emit mainly bright green and white light. During the sequence, two dark-and-orange gloves occasionally enter the frame from the bottom, reaching out to manipulate the directions.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, moves through a fantastical underwater forest in murky, teal-green water. The environment is dominated by towering, tree-like structures with thick, textured trunks, from which sprout large, flat, disc-shaped caps. The undersides of these caps are a reddish-pink color with a honeycomb texture, while their tops are dark. Bioluminescent green organisms cling to the trunks, and small, glowing creatures drift throughout the water. The camera glides past a large school of small, glowing green fish-like creatures that swarm together. The seabed below is a patchwork of white sand and dark green, moss-covered terrain. The entire scene is viewed through a dark, reddish-brown frame resembling a helmet's visor, and a faint text overlay reading \"Loopy Longplays\" is visible in the bottom left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person point-of-view, framed by a diving mask in the extreme foreground, the camera moves forward and slightly to the right through a dense underwater environment. Towering, tree-like structures are positioned across the entire frame, extending from the foreground and middle ground into the deep background, creating a sense of depth. The camera glides between the trunks of these structures, which are located in the foreground and middle ground on both the left and right sides. The seabed is visible at the bottom of the frame, situated in the middle ground. As the camera advances, a large school of small, glowing creatures appears in the center-left of the frame, occupying the middle ground. Near the end of the sequence, two gloved hands enter from the bottom of the frame, moving upward and outward into the foreground toward the center of the shot. The camera's height remains consistent as it navigates the space, positioned below the tops of the large structures but above the seabed.",
