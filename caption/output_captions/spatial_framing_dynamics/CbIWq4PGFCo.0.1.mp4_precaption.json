    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark, somewhat tousled hair is seen from the back and slightly to the side. He is wearing a dark-colored, possibly black, crew-neck sweatshirt. His head is slightly turned to his right, and he appears to be looking downwards or to the side, with his face mostly obscured.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors in a vast, open landscape, likely a desert or arid plain, under a pale sky. In the distance, hazy, purplish-blue mountains are visible. The time of day appears to be dusk or dawn, with soft, low-angle light creating a noticeable lens flare or strong backlight that illuminates the back of a person's head. The person, with dark, somewhat messy hair and wearing a crew-neck sweatshirt, is seen from behind, looking out over the expansive, somewhat barren terrain, which features low-lying vegetation and appears dry. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by blues, grays, and browns, with the backlight introducing a bright, warm highlight.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot centers on a man, viewed from the back and slightly to his right, occupying the foreground. His head is turned slightly to his right. A vast, open landscape extends across the middle ground and background behind him, with hazy mountains visible in the far background. A prominent backlight or lens flare highlights the top left portion of the man's head. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the scene.",
