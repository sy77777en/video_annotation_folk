    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a close-up of a brown, textured corkboard. Several red strings radiate from a central point on the board, held in place by a red, round-headed thumbtack. Pinned beneath the thumbtack is a small, square, light blue sticky note with the words \"UNCLE JERRY\" written in black, block capital letters. Subsequently, another small, square, red sticky note appears to the right of the light blue note, passes through the strings, and appears beneath them. This red note displays the text \"JEROME JACOBSON\" in black, block capital letters.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, featuring a corkboard with a textured, mottled surface. Red strings are pinned to the board, radiating from a central red pin. Two pieces of paper are attached to the board: one is light blue with \"UNCLE JERRY\" written in bold letters, and the other is red with \"JEROME JACOBSON\" inscribed. The strings connect these papers, suggesting a network or connection between them. In the second part of the video, the red sticky note passes through the strings and appears beneath them. The lighting is brighter in the center, highlighting the board's details and the vibrant color of the strings. There is an overlay in the bottom left that says \"[4,5].\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a close-up of a corkboard with red strings with several red strings crossing each other, meeting at a central point where a white card is fixed. The white card displays the text \"UNCLE JERRY.\" A red card then appears next to the white card, showing the text \"JEROME JACOBSON.\"\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It\u2019s unclear whether the corkboard is mounted on a wall or placed on a table, making it difficult to determine the camera\u2019s height relative to it.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a corkboard, which serves as the background. Initially, a light blue sticky note with the text \"UNCLE JERRY\" is positioned in the center-bottom of the frame. Directly above it, in the center, a red thumbtack holds multiple red strings that radiate outwards across the frame. A red sticky note, displaying the text \"JEROME JACOBSON,\" then slides into the frame from the right. It moves toward the center, passing underneath the red strings, and settles in the center-bottom of the frame, to the right of the blue note. The camera remains static throughout the sequence.",
