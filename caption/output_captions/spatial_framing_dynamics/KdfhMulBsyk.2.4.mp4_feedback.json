    "pre_caption": "In a close-up, over-the-shoulder shot, a man wearing a blue cap is positioned in the foreground on the left side of the frame, with his back to the camera. The camera, positioned at his level, follows him as he walks forward into a blurred crowd of people occupying the middle ground and background across the center and right of the frame. As he moves, his position remains stable on the left, while the out-of-focus background elements, including indistinct figures and bright lights, shift past him.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with short, light-colored hair is seen from behind, wearing a dark shirt and a blue baseball cap worn forwards. He is walking forward into a blurred crowd of people. Among the indistinct figures in the background, one person is visible wearing a light-colored sweater, and another is in a blue jacket, though their features are out of focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, follows a person in a blue baseball cap and a dark shirt. They move through a brightly lit, crowded indoor space, possibly a parking garage or an underground area. The background is heavily blurred, with bright, out-of-focus overhead lights creating large bokeh effects. Other indistinct figures and a white vehicle are visible in the distance, all rendered with a shallow depth of field. The scene has a cool, desaturated color palette.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
