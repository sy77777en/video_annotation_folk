    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a seascape from the perspective of a container ship. Rows of shipping containers occupy the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground and converging toward the center. The ocean fills the middle ground, stretching to the horizon which is positioned centrally in the frame. The sky dominates the upper half of the frame in the background, with clouds scattered throughout and a larger cloud formation on the right. A watermark is located in the bottom right corner, and a line of text is overlaid at the bottom center.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dramatic seascape shot from the perspective of a large container ship sailing on the open ocean. The composition emphasizes the immense scale of the environment and atmospheric conditions, with no single main subject. Prominently featured in the foreground and extending into the middle ground, stacks of shipping containers effectively direct the viewer's gaze towards the vast, calm sea stretching to the horizon. Above, the sky is a breathtaking canvas of soft pinks and purples near the horizon, suggesting either sunrise or sunset, transitioning into a deep teal higher up, all under a blanket of scattered, wispy clouds and a more formidable cloud bank to the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high vantage point on the bow of a container ship, the scene looks out over rows of stacked shipping containers toward the open sea. The containers, in shades of blue, gray, and brown, fill the foreground and extend to the middle ground. The vast ocean is calm under a sky transitioning from a soft pink and orange glow at the horizon to a deep teal-blue above, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. Scattered clouds are present, with a large cloud formation on the right. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays a YouTube watermark for 'JEFFHK'. Additional white text is overlaid at the bottom as a subtitle, reading, \"Timestamps are in the description below corresponding to the narration of events (ie. Thunderstorms, Torrent Rain, Arrival/Departure Ports)\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
