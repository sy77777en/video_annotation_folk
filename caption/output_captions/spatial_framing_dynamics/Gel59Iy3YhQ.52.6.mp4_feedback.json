Initially, the blue player character is positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, surrounded by several black enemies. The background is lined with rock formations and lit candles along the top and left perimeter of the arena. As the action begins, the player character and enemies move dynamically around the central space, with projectiles like red laser beams and blue energy arcs traversing the frame. More enemies spawn at the bottom of the screen, and the player character moves toward them.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a video game scene, the player character is a small, stylized, glowing blue creature with a fox-like appearance and pointed ears. It is surrounded by several small, black, insectoid or bat-like enemies that have glowing red eyes and markings. The combat is visualized with brightly colored projectiles, including straight red laser beams, clusters of white bubbly projectiles, and arcs of blue, electric-like energy that form small, glowing constellations on the dark purple floor. A user interface is present, featuring three vertical white bars in the bottom-left corner, and icons representing a sword, a bomb, a blue orb, and several small red hearts in the top-right corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed directly above the character and looks down on them, the action unfolds in a dark, enclosed arena. The floor is composed of dark, cracked tiles, and the entire scene is cast in a strong purple and red glow. The perimeter of the combat area is lined with rock-like formations and numerous lit candles. A small, glowing blue character moves around the space, battling several small, black, winged enemies. The combat is filled with vibrant particle effects, including red laser beams, blue electrical discharges, and bright explosions that scatter across the floor. The video features several overlay elements. In the bottom-left corner are three vertical bars. A heads-up display in the top-right corner shows icons of a sword, a blue orb, and hearts, alongside changing numerical values. A circular targeting reticle with a health bar also appears over enemies.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
