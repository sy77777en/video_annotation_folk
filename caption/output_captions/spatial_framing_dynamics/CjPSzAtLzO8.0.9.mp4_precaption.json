    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person is shown wearing full motorcycle racing gear, including a blue and white helmet with green accents and a dark blue racing suit with black and white boots. They are riding a racing motorcycle that is primarily blue with red and white graphics. The motorcycle features various sponsor logos, including \"DELL Technologies\" and \"TRIUMPH,\" along with other logos that are indistinguishable. The bike has black wheels and is leaning sharply into a turn.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a scene on a paved racetrack during the daytime. The dark gray asphalt of the track is bordered by a black-and-yellow checkered curb, which separates it from the surrounding dry, light-brown dirt landscape. Bright sunlight casts a distinct shadow on the pavement as the camera follows a blue, red, and white motorcycle navigating a wide, sweeping turn.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a high angle, showing a motorcycle positioned in the center of the frame as it navigates a turn on a racetrack. The track curves from the bottom right towards the top left, with a checkered curb in the middle ground and a dirt landscape in the background. The camera then moves forward and descends, transitioning into a full shot at the subject's level. In this final framing, the motorcycle and rider fill the center of the frame, with the front wheel in the bottom center, as the camera tracks alongside them.",
