    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle isometric perspective, a 3D icon is positioned in the bottom-left foreground against a dark grid background. A segmented, arrow-shaped timeline begins at this icon, extending diagonally towards the top right and receding into the middle ground. Initially, text labels for \"July 31, 2016\" and \"2016\" are visible on the timeline in the foreground and middle ground. As the video progresses, the timeline extends further into the middle ground, with its segments changing color from yellow to orange and then red. The text \"2017\" and \"Late 2017\" appear sequentially along the growing timeline. Finally, a yellow triangular warning sign icon materializes in the middle ground, positioned above the red arrowhead at the timeline's end. The camera remains static throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An isometric timeline graphic is presented on a dark gray grid. The timeline is shaped like an arrow and is composed of segments that change color from yellow-green at the beginning to orange and then red at the arrowhead. Positioned at the start of the timeline is a 3D, rounded square icon with a light blue background and a white border. Inside the icon is a cartoon cow with black and white spots, set within a circular frame. Below the cow, the words \"\u00c7iftlik BANK\" are written in white. Various white text labels are placed along the timeline, including \"July 31, 2016\" near the start, \"2016,\" \"2017,\" and \"Late 2017\" near the red end. A yellow, triangular warning sign containing a black exclamation mark appears near the arrowhead.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a dark, gridded background, a three-dimensional, light-blue icon featuring a cartoon cow and the text \"\u00c7iftlik Bank\" is shown. A segmented, arrow-shaped timeline extends from the icon, its color graduating from yellow to orange and then to red. Several text overlays are placed along this timeline, including \"July 31, 2016\" near the start, followed by markers for \"2016\" and \"2017.\" At the red end of the arrow, the overlay text \"Late 2017\" is displayed, and a yellow, triangular warning sign icon with an exclamation mark appears as an overlay at the timeline's conclusion.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
