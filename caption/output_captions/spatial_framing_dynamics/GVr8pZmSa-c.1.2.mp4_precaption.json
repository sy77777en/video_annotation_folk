    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a small, irregularly shaped piece of metal, likely a fragment, resting on a gray, textured surface. The metal has a corroded appearance, with a mottled green and brown patina. Engraved on its surface are discernible features, including a large circular shape resembling a wheel, some letter-like markings, and several smaller, gear-like circular patterns.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video features a dynamic shot where the camera moves forward and arcs around a small, irregularly shaped metallic artifact resting on a rough, grey, textured surface. The artifact is heavily corroded, displaying a mottled green and brown patina. Engraved onto its surface are discernible features, including part of a large wheel, letters, and indentations suggesting smaller gears. The camera provides a comprehensive view of the object from various angles.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, featuring a small, irregularly shaped metallic artifact positioned in the center foreground, resting on a gray, textured surface that fills the frame as the background. As the shot progresses, the camera moves forward, transitioning to a full shot of the artifact, while simultaneously arcing around it from right to left. This movement keeps the artifact in the center foreground, offering a changing perspective of its details against the consistent background surface. The camera remains positioned above the subject throughout the shot.",
