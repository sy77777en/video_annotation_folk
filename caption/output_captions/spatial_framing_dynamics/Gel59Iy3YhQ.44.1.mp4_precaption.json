    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pixelated character, moving towards the right side of the frame, features a face with a yellow cross-shaped design, likely representing its eye. The upper body is clad in a yellow-green garment, possibly armor, while the lower body wears red pants. As the character runs, two red and yellow striped ribbons trail behind from the neck area. As it crosses a bridge, a blue vertical beam of light emerges from beneath its feet, from which a bat-shaped bird flies out. On the left side of the frame, a blue, glowing potion in a clear, round-bottomed flask gradually disappears. Meanwhile, on the right side, a table with a set of chemistry lab equipment appears. In the lower-left corner of the screen, several square icons are displayed: the first icon on the left is a bomb symbol; the second is a blue jagged lightning bolt; the third is a blue wind-shaped tail with a red wind pattern; the fourth is a stylized brown-and-white owl head; the fifth is a red-and-black bullet-shaped icon; and the sixth is a purple crossbow symbol.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a side-view perspective of the character shows an outdoor scene at night. A large, luminous full moon dominates the teal and purple, star-speckled sky, which also features a distant, bright, nebula-like formation. The foreground features a dark purple, metallic-looking bridge or walkway with a simple railing, upon which a small, pixelated character in red pants and a top is running. Below the bridge, dark, indistinct structures and hanging vines are present. To the left, on a platform, sits a glowing blue potion. Overlay elements include a heads-up display at the bottom of the screen showing ability icons (a blue arrow-shaped element, an owl, a purple crossbow), a green health bar, and numerical resource counters. In the bottom center is a larger health bar (2879/6427). The bottom right displays icons for a green key, a brown block, a blue gem (103), and an orange coin (327), along with a timer (around 40m 04s), a number 5, and a mini-map depicting a red room.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nIt's a 2D video, so don't say the 3D position of the elements.",
    "pre_caption": "The video employs a wide shot with a side-view perspective, where the camera maintains the character at its height. Initially, a pixelated character is positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground, moving rightwards towards the right side of the frame along a dark purple, metallic-looking bridge that extends horizontally across the frame's mid-section. As the character progresses, a blue potion on a platform in the left middle ground gradually disappears, while chemistry lab equipment on a table materializes in the right middle ground. Concurrently, a blue vertical beam of light emanates from beneath the character on the bridge, with a bat-shaped bird ascending upwards from it. The background features a large, luminous moon positioned from the top left to the top center, and a bright, nebula-like formation in the center to top right. Dark, indistinct structures and hanging vines occupy the foreground and middle ground layers below the bridge. User interface elements, including ability icons, health bars, and resource counters, are overlaid in the foreground at the bottom left and bottom center, while a mini-map, timer, and other icons are in the foreground at the bottom right of the screen.",
