    "pre_caption": "The video initially presents a full shot of an old television, which is centered in the frame and occupies the foreground. On the television screen, which is in the middle ground relative to the main frame, various scenes from \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" are displayed. Initially, two men are shown; the one on the left is positioned slightly left of the TV screen's center, and the one on the right is slightly to the right, both in the middle ground of the TV display. Subsequently, a man identified as Adrian Pollock appears centered on the TV screen, also in its middle ground, with text overlays for his name and prize money at the bottom center of the TV screen and a date at the top, all in the foreground of the TV display. Later, a woman is shown on the left side of the TV screen, in its middle ground, with a prize money ladder on the right side of the TV screen, also in its middle ground. A question and answer options then appear at the bottom of the TV screen, in its middle ground. A show title overlay remains consistently at the bottom left of the main video frame, in the foreground. As the video progresses, the camera continuously zooms in, causing the television screen to increasingly fill the main frame. By the end, the TV screen dominates the view, leaving only a small border of the physical television visible at the edges, and the content on the TV screen effectively becomes the middle ground of the entire shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays footage from the quiz show \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" playing on an older, dark-cased television set. Initially, the TV screen shows two fair-skinned men on the show's set. The man on the left is balding with short, light-colored hair on the sides and is wearing a light blue button-down shirt with light-colored trousers. The man on the right has lighter, possibly graying hair and wears a dark turtleneck under a gray suit jacket; he smiles and has his arm around the first man's shoulder. The focus on the TV screen then shifts to the first man, identified as Adrian Pollock, sitting alone and looking towards the camera, followed by a graphic displaying his winnings of \u00a332,000. Later, the TV screen features a woman with long, dark brown hair, fair skin, and wearing a red top. She is shown looking seriously towards the camera next to the show's prize money ladder, which also highlights the \u00a332,000 level. Subsequently, she appears looking down and covering her face with her right hand while a question is displayed on the screen below her. As the video progresses, the camera zooms in, causing the TV screen content to dominate the view, leaving only a small border of the physical television visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video displays footage from the game show \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" on an old, dark grey CRT television screen. The game show scenes take place in a studio with a dark, patterned backdrop and stage lighting. Initially, two men are seen on stage, one with his arm around the other. Following this, the video transitions to an interview segment on stage, with the audience visible in the background. Subsequent scenes feature a man with a receding hairline, identified by an on-screen graphic as \"ADRIAN POLLOCK,\" with overlays indicating the date \"December 23, 2000\" and \"TOTAL PRIZE MONEY \u00a332,000.\" Later, a woman with dark hair appears, with a money ladder graphic on the right side of the screen highlighting \u00a332,000. She is then shown looking down, covering her face, as a question overlay asks, \"Who wrote the nonsense poem 'The Hunting of the Snark'?\" with answer options \"A. G.K. Chesterton\" and \"B. Hilaire Belloc.\" An overlay in the bottom left corner of the television screen reads \"[5] ; ITV - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (2000)\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a television displaying a quiz show with many characters. It's overall a full shot of the television initially. As the camera continuously zooms in, the frame becomes almost entirely filled with the video on the TV screen, leaving only a small portion of the TV's border visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
