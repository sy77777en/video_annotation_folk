    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This locked-on POV shot features a camera mounted on the front side of a red car. The most prominent feature is the front wheel, which is black with sunlight reflecting on the outer rim, giving it a golden appearance. The black tire is mounted on this wheel. Adjacent to the wheel, a portion of the car's glossy red body panel is visible, along with a red side mirror further in the distance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a level angle on the side of a red car captures the front wheel spinning as the vehicle travels down a paved road at sunset or sunrise. A line of dark trees is silhouetted against the bright, low sun, which casts a golden glow across the scene. The sky is clear, fading from orange at the horizon to blue above, where several celestial bodies are visible. The black tire on a dark rim moves swiftly, and the texture of the road surface appears as illuminated streaks in the sunlight due to the fast movement.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is mounted on the side of a car, showing a close-up of the wheel and part of the side, while the right side of the frame reveals more of the scene in a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This shot combines a close-up and a wide view, with the camera positioned low and level with the car's wheel. The car's red side panel occupies the left foreground, while its rapidly spinning front wheel is in the center-left foreground. The right side of the frame opens to the scenery, with the paved road extending from the bottom right into the middle ground. A silhouetted treeline stretches across the right middle ground, set against the sun, which is positioned at the horizon in the center-right. The sky fills the upper right of the frame, reaching into the background. Because the camera is fixed to the car, the vehicle remains stationary within the frame as the road and trees rush past from the middle ground, creating motion-blurred streaks that convey a sense of high-speed forward movement.",
