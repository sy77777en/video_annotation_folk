    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a dynamic display of numerous glowing, circular light patterns of varying sizes and intensities. These lights are predominantly warm tones, such as gold and amber, creating a shimmering effect. The circles overlap and move in a fluid, organic manner, giving the impression of floating or drifting. The overall visual is abstract, with no discernible objects or figures, focusing solely on the interplay of light and color.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene presents an abstract, dynamic display of glowing orbs against a dark background. These orbs vary in size and intensity, with colors ranging from warm yellows to deep oranges, creating a vibrant and lively atmosphere. The orbs appear to float and move gently, suggesting a sense of depth and motion. The overall effect is reminiscent of a festive or celebratory setting, with the glowing elements resembling lights or reflections. The dark backdrop enhances the brightness and color of the orbs, making them stand out prominently in the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video showcases an abstract scene with numerous glowing, circular light patterns against a dark background. These circles vary in size and intensity, predominantly in warm tones like gold and amber. They are distributed throughout the frame, with some positioned in the foreground, creating a sense of depth, while others recede into the middle ground and background. The lights overlap and move fluidly, drifting from one side to another, often from the bottom left to the top right, or vice versa, enhancing the dynamic nature of the scene. The camera appears to be at a neutral height relative to the lights, maintaining a consistent view of the shimmering orbs as they float and shift positions, creating a lively and vibrant visual effect.",
