    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of an interior space, captured from an eye-level perspective. The shot begins in a storage room, with a white shelving unit in the left foreground and another in the right foreground. A window showing a green landscape is visible in the center background. The camera then glides backward and to the right, smoothly transitioning the view into an adjoining bedroom. In the final framing, a wooden bed occupies the left middle ground, while a wooden desk and chair are positioned in the right middle ground. The window is now located in the top left background, above the bed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an interior scenery shot, moving through a series of simply furnished rooms. The camera glides from a storage area, featuring white-framed shelves with wooden surfaces against wood-paneled walls, into an adjoining bedroom. This second room contains a simple wooden bed with white linens and a matching wooden desk and chair. A small window offers a view of green trees against a grassy landscape. The shot lacks a main subject, as the focus is placed on the overall environment, showcasing the minimalist and utilitarian design of the wood-paneled interior.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents two different interior rooms, both featuring wood-paneled walls and a grey floor. The first room is a storage area containing two white metal shelving units with wooden shelves. A window on the back wall provides a view of a green, grassy area with several trees. The scene then transitions to a bedroom, which includes a single wooden bed with white bedding and a matching wooden desk and chair. A similar window is located above the bed, showing the same outdoor view of the trees and green landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
