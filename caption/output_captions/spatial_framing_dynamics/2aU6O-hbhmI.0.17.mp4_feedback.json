    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban cityscape, capturing a tall residential building prominently in the center of the frame. Initially, the building occupies most of the frame, with its facade featuring numerous windows and balconies. It is positioned centrally in the 2D space and in the foreground of the 3D scene. Surrounding structures, such as a smaller brick building, appear in the background, situated towards the left side of the frame. The camera maintains a height slightly below the building, emphasizing its verticality. As the video progresses, the camera pans around the building, shifting its position from the front to the side, revealing more of the surrounding area. The sky, overcast and dusky, forms the backdrop, occupying the upper portion of the frame. The transition from the initial frontal view to the side view showcases the building's architectural details and the urban environment around it. The camera remains at a consistent height throughout, maintaining the building as the central focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a cityscape scenery, initially highlighting the urban environment and architecture of a tall building with numerous windows and balconies. As the scene unfolds, the focus shifts to two men standing on a balcony. The man on the left is wearing a navy blue shirt and white shorts, while the man on the right is dressed in a pink shirt and jeans. The illuminated windows against the dusky sky and the presence of other buildings contribute to the overall atmosphere of the urban landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of an urban environment at dusk. The setting features a tall, modern residential building with a red and gray facade, characterized by large glass windows and balconies. The sky is overcast, casting a muted light over the scene. Surrounding the main building are other structures, including a smaller brick building. The drone's movement provides a dynamic perspective, initially showcasing the building's height and architectural details before focusing on the balconies, where people are visible. The overall atmosphere is calm, with the city lights beginning to glow as evening approaches.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
