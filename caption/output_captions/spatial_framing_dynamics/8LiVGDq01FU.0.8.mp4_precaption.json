    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person wearing a space helmet with a clear visor, revealing their face. The individual has light skin and appears to be focused, looking intently out of a window. The helmet is predominantly dark with lighter accents, and the person is positioned in profile, facing to the left. The lighting highlights the contours of their face and helmet, emphasizing the reflective surface of the visor. The setting suggests an enclosed space, possibly a spacecraft or similar environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors within a dimly lit space. The primary visual element is a bookshelf densely packed with books, their spines facing outward. Positioned in profile before the bookshelf is an individual wearing a white and grey astronaut helmet featuring a clear visor, through which their face is visible. The lighting is low, casting shadows and highlighting reflections on the helmet's visor. Throughout the video, the individual's head shifts slightly.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot frames a person wearing a space helmet on the right side of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. On the left, a bookshelf fills the frame, situated in the middle ground, while some book spines are visible in the foreground on the far left. The person, shown in profile looking towards the left, slightly tilts their head upwards before returning to the initial side view. The camera maintains a position level with the subject.",
