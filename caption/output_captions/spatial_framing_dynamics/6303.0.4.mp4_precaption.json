    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up of a hand holding a smartphone. The hand has a medium to dark skin tone and is adorned with long, pink-painted nails. The person is wearing a light green sleeve. The smartphone screen initially displays an image of a man with a beard and mustache, wearing a hood, with the text \"KODAK ONHA\" and music player controls visible. Later, the screen shows a colorful graphic with the text \"SUMMER HITS,\" featuring flowers and a cactus, along with an \"Add to Playlist\" button. The hand interacts with the screen, indicating a change in the display.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character\u2019s eyes, set indoors with a focus on a smartphone held in a hand. The environment features a checkered floor with alternating dark and light green tiles, creating a geometric pattern. The time of day is not explicitly indicated, but the lighting suggests an evenly lit space. The smartphone screen displays different content, transitioning from a music player interface with an album cover to a colorful graphic titled \"Summer Hits\" with playful floral and cactus illustrations. The hand holding the phone has neatly manicured nails painted in a light pink shade, and a distinctive orange ring is worn on one finger. The scene captures the interaction with the phone, emphasizing the digital content and the tactile engagement with the device.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot, filmed from above the subjects. A hand occupies the bottom left and central foreground, holding a smartphone positioned in the center foreground. Initially, the smartphone screen displays a music player interface. The background consists of a green checkered floor. A finger from the hand moves from the bottom right foreground towards the center of the phone screen, interacting with it. The content on the smartphone screen changes to a \"Summer Hits\" graphic, which remains in the center foreground. The hand and smartphone maintain their positions throughout the shot.",
