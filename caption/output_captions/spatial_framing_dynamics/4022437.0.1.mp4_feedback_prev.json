    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot that frames the entire Mercedes S550 in the center of the image, positioned in the middle ground, with the paved parking lot occupying the foreground and low industrial buildings and trees in the background. The car is viewed from the rear left corner, with both left-side doors open, and the camera is at the same height as the car, providing a level perspective. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward toward the car, transitioning to a close-up shot that focuses on the left rear wheel, which now dominates the center and lower part of the frame in the foreground. In this close-up, the Mercedes and AMG badges, as well as the Continental branding on the tire, are clearly visible, while the rest of the car and the background buildings shift out of focus or move partially out of frame, emphasizing the wheel as the primary subject. Throughout the video, the camera maintains its height at the level of the car, and the spatial relationship between the car and the background elements remains consistent, with only the shot size and subject prominence changing as the camera moves closer.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a Mercedes S550, viewed from the rear left corner. The camera begins with a wide shot of the entire car before move forwards to focus in on the left rear wheel. In this close-up, the Mercedes and AMG badges are clearly visible, along with the Continental branding on the tire. The car's sleek black exterior contrasts with its tan leather interior, and its large, silver alloy wheels feature a five-spoke pattern. A few buildings can be seen in the background, adding context to the setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors in a paved parking lot bordered by low, light-colored industrial buildings and a few trees, with a clear sky and soft daylight suggesting late morning or afternoon. A black sedan with both the front and rear doors on the left side open is parked on the lot, its glossy exterior reflecting the surroundings. The car\u2019s wheels are silver with a five-spoke design and a metallic finish, featuring a prominent circular emblem at the center. The pavement is textured with visible aggregate and marked by white painted lines. In the background, additional buildings and a few residential structures are visible, contributing to an urban or suburban setting. No overlays, text, or digital elements are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
