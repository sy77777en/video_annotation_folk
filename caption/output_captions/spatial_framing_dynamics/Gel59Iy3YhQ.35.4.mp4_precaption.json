    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a room with a fleshy, veined border, several atypical creatures are present. The main figure is a dark brown, demonic head with white eyes and curved, spiral-shaped ram horns. Surrounding it is a floating, small red regular hexagonal weapon. There are also two round-headed creatures; the larger one has a purple face, while the smaller one has a pale face. Both have large smiles and their heads are surrounded by dark pink, vein-like hair. While the smaller round-headed creature attacks, it is surrounded by several small, red orbs. A small, black, cat-like figure with pointed ears and white eyes is also visible. A round, black bomb with a lit fuse appears briefly. The scene is marked by splatters of red and green liquid.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A 2D gaming video shows a single, square room with fleshy, veiny, reddish-brown walls. In the center of the beige floor is a large, dark brown, cross-shaped object. The floor is stained with splatters of red blood and a patch of green liquid. Several small, pixelated figures, including a brown sheep-like creature with curved, spiral-shaped ram horns, two pink round-headed creatures, and a cat-like creature, move within the space. Overlay elements frame the scene. In the top-left corner, a heads-up display shows an hourglass, heart icons, and numerical values for coins, bombs, and keys. In the top-right corner, a map-like square is visible. In the bottom-right corner, the text \"1 - The Magician\" is visible, and a white snake icon is in the bottom-left.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "A wide, top-down shot captures a single room in a 2D video game, framed by heads-up display elements in the foreground at the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners. In the middle ground, a demonic head character starts in the center-left, with a small black figure below it and a pale, round creature to its left. Another purple, round creature occupies the top right. The demonic head moves up to the top of the frame and then down to the bottom center, firing a long, wavy red projectile that follows a similar path. As this happens, the pale creature moves toward the center of the room before disappearing and being replaced by a small bomb, while the small black figure shifts to the center-left area. The purple creature remains in the top right corner.",
