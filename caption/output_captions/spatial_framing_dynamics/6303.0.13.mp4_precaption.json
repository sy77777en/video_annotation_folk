    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark skin, a large black afro, a mustache, and a light beard is shown from the chest up. He wears a textured, bright red sweater. His mouth is slightly open and his eyebrows are raised as he looks toward the right. In the background, several mannequin heads with various hairstyles are displayed on shelves. To the left, one mannequin has long, dark hair, while another below it has reddish-brown, shoulder-length hair.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors in a stylized room with dim, atmospheric lighting. A back wall is covered in a black and white checkerboard pattern, upon which a purple neon sign and a lit lampshade are mounted. The room is cast in a teal-green hue, contrasted by vertical orange tube lights that frame a large, arched mirror. The mirror reflects another section of the checkerboard wall and additional mannequin heads on shelves. Several mannequin heads displaying wigs are also visible on shelves to the left. A man in a textured red sweater is centrally located, positioned behind a white tub or basin in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a man in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground behind a white tub in the foreground. In the background, mannequin heads are on shelves to the left, with a lit lampshade also on the left and a neon sign in the top left. An arched mirror framed by orange lights is in the background on the right. The shot then changes to a medium shot. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
