    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of six young men with dark skin are gathered in a paved area next to a dark-colored sedan with its driver's side door open. The man in the center of the group has dark, curly hair and is wearing a black long-sleeved shirt, black pants, and red and white sneakers. To his left stands another young man in a black hoodie and black pants. In the foreground, two men are visible from the back, both wearing black hoodies. To the far left, another man in a black hoodie stands near the car, where a sixth man wearing a white beanie and a black jacket is also visible. In the middle ground, a man stands apart from the group, wearing a black hoodie with the hood up and white sneakers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a paved outdoor lot during a sunny day, long, dark shadows stretch across the cracked gray ground. A group of individuals in dark clothing stands near a black car with an open door. In the background, other parked vehicles, a dark green fence, and multi-story brick buildings are visible. A pile of cardboard boxes rests on the pavement near the edge of the lot. The camera's perspective shifts from a wide view to a higher, more direct overhead angle looking down on the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "Initially, a full shot frames a group of young men from a slightly high angle. The main group is positioned in the center and left of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground. A central figure stands in the middle ground, with two other men in the bottom left foreground, their backs to the camera. To the left, a dark car with an open door is in the middle ground, and another man stands alone in the right middle ground. In the background, other cars and buildings are visible. The camera then moves vertically upward, shifting the perspective to a high-angle, top-down view that looks directly down on the subjects, who remain in their positions on the cracked pavement below.",
