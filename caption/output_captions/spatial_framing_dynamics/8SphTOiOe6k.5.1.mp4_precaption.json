    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a lively Japanese commercial street scene. In the middle ground, two women wearing traditional kimonos with intricate patterns and sashes stand out, one in red with white floral designs and the other in a darker shade with a similar pattern. Nearby, a group of schoolchildren in uniform, consisting of dark blazers and skirts or shorts, gather closely, some with backpacks, appearing engaged in conversation or observing something of interest. Additionally, two elderly individuals wearing masks are seen walking past the camera. The shop's exterior is visible, with signs and displays hinting at a vibrant, lively atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene captures a bustling outdoor setting in front of a traditional Japanese shop. The architecture features a sloped roof with wooden accents and a modern glass storefront. The time of day appears to be daytime, with clear visibility and no signs of adverse weather. The shop displays colorful signage and promotional boards, with images of food items. A group of people, including individuals in traditional kimonos and others in modern attire, are gathered near the entrance, suggesting a mix of cultural and contemporary elements. The ground is paved, and a few decorative elements, such as hanging ornaments, add to the visual interest. The environment is lively, with people interacting and moving around the shop area.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a bustling Japanese commercial street scene. In the middle ground, two women in traditional kimonos are positioned slightly to the right, with one in red and the other in a darker shade, standing near the shop entrance. They are centrally framed, with the shop's exterior in the background. To the left, a group of schoolchildren in uniforms gathers closely, occupying the middle ground and partially overlapping with the shop's entrance. The children are engaged in conversation, adding dynamic movement to the scene. In the foreground, two elderly individuals wearing masks walk past the camera from left to right, briefly entering the frame. The shop's architecture, with its sloped roof and glass storefront, forms the background, while colorful signage and promotional boards are visible throughout. The camera is positioned at the subjects' height, capturing the lively interaction and movement within the scene.",
