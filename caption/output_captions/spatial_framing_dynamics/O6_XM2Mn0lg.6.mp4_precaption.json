    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A human figure is depicted in close-up, wearing a dark, textured hood that conceals most of its head, and a bright yellow mask, possibly with a segmented design, over its face. Behind the figure, a glass-like structure shatters into many sharp, translucent pieces, which reflect bluish-white light as they fly outwards from the point of impact. It is speculated that the figure might have been struck by an object coming from behind, causing the shattering effect.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds in a dark setting that resembles a shadowy forest, with indistinct, blurred background forms. A shadowy humanoid figure, showing a small area of dull yellow on its upper portion, is centrally positioned. This figure is enveloped by a dynamic multitude of sharp, angular, crystalline fragments that resemble transparent glass shards. These fragments reflect bluish-white light as they explode outward from a central point, scattering in all directions.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a close-up shot of a human figure wearing a hood and a yellow mask. The camera maintains a level angle, focusing tightly on the upper part of the character's face and mask. As the scene progresses, the figure is struck by a glassy object, causing it to shatter into many pieces. \n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video utilizes a close-up shot, with the camera at the subject's level, tightly framing the upper portion of a human figure's hooded head and yellow mask; this figure is positioned centrally in the middle ground. During the shot, a glassy object shatters upon striking the figure or its immediate vicinity, causing numerous sharp, translucent fragments to explode outwards from a central point around the figure. These fragments scatter in all directions, dynamically moving through the foreground, enveloping the figure in the middle ground, and receding towards the indistinct, blurred forms that make up the background.",
