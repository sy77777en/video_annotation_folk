A dark green hanging plant is positioned in the background, top left-center against the wall, while a wooden furniture leg is visible in the background on the right. A rectangular tray then enters the frame from the top left, falling into the foreground, accompanied by two clear glasses. The tray comes to rest on one of its longer edges in the center-left foreground. One glass rolls from the center foreground towards the center-right foreground, settling on its side and remaining fully visible. The second glass also rolls in the foreground but moves partially out of frame or becomes obscured, likely towards the left. A brown liquid spill is visible on the floor in the bottom right foreground, near the wooden leg. A white text overlay \"[28]\" is consistently present in the bottom left corner of the foreground. When the tray and glasses appear, becoming the subjects, the camera is at their height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially presents a level angle above the ground of a dark, textured floor in front of a brown wooden paneled wall, where a dark green hanging plant and the wooden leg of a piece of furniture are visible. Subsequently, a rectangular tray, which appears to be made of a coppery or dark metallic material and features ornate, dark metallic handles on its shorter sides, falls into the frame from above. Two clear, cylindrical glasses, which are slightly tapered towards their bases, fall along with the tray. After impact, the tray comes to rest on one of its longer edges, while the two glasses roll across the floor. One glass rolls partially out of the frame or becomes obscured, while the other glass rolls and settles on its side, remaining fully visible on the floor.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from an objective point of view, depicts an indoor setting featuring a dark brown, vertically paneled wooden wall and a grey, textured concrete or stone floor. A dark green, leafy plant hangs from the upper part of the wooden wall. On the right side of the scene, a wooden leg, likely belonging to a table or chair, is visible. A copper-colored metal tray with ornate, dark metal handles, initially out of view, swings down from the top left and falls onto the floor. Two clear, empty glasses, which were on the tray, also fall, with both glasses bouncing and rolling slightly after impact. A brown liquid spill is visible on the floor in front of the table leg on the right side of the frame. An overlay of white text \"[27]\" is present in the bottom left corner throughout most of the video, changing to \"[28]\" near the end.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: At first, there is no subject in the frame. Then a tray, together with two glasses, falls to the ground. Two glasses roll on the ground, and only one of them is fully visible in the frame at the end.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject, and the camera height remains unchanged.",
