    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of a clear liquid filling the frame. A small, orange, round object enters from the top center and moves downward, plunging into the liquid at the bottom of the frame. As it submerges, it creates a splash that fills the upper half of the frame. The object then bobs up from the bottom to the center of the frame, where it remains, fully visible. The orange object is positioned in the middle ground, surrounded by bubbles in both the foreground and middle ground. The background is dark and indistinct. The camera remains static and at eye-level with the object inside the glass throughout the entire sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, round, orange ball is shown plunging into and being submerged in a clear, bubbling liquid. The ball has a vibrant orange color and a textured, dimpled surface, similar in appearance to the peel of a small citrus fruit. As it enters the liquid, it creates a large splash and becomes enveloped by numerous small air bubbles that cling to its surface and swirl in the water around it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a close-up shot, a round, bright orange object with a textured surface is submerged in a clear, effervescent liquid inside a glass container. The initial entry creates a turbulent splash with large air bubbles. The object then bobs near the surface as a multitude of fine bubbles continuously rise from below, clinging to the object and filling the transparent liquid. The background is dark and undefined.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a small orange ball entering the water. Initially, only the glass of water is visible, with no ball. As the ball enters the glass, it appears with a dynamic size, sometimes fully visible and other times only half visible. Overall, it's a full shot of the subject with dynamic size.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject, and the camera height remains unchanged.",
