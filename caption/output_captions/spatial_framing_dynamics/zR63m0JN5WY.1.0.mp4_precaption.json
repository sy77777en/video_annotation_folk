    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark-skinned man with a full, dark beard is shown dunking a basketball. He is wearing a dark gray sleeveless tank top, black shorts, and dark-colored basketball shoes with light-colored soles. He holds an orange basketball in his right hand as he jumps toward the hoop to complete the dunk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds inside a dimly lit indoor basketball gymnasium with a high, arched ceiling made of dark wood. Rows of long, rectangular fluorescent lights are mounted along the curved structure, rhythmically dimming to create an atmosphere of alternating light and shadow on the polished wooden floor. The walls are a plain, light color, and a basketball hoop is positioned at the far end, with another hoop high up in the upper right corner. A man in athletic attire is shown leaping from the ground, dynamically shooting the basketball toward the upper right corner hoop. Additional light streams in from the stadium's main entrance located in the left background, enhancing the scene's dynamic ambiance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a man standing in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground of an indoor basketball court. A basketball hoop is visible in the upper right background, situated under a high, arched ceiling that fills the top portion of the frame. From a camera position at the subject's level, the man jumps from the center, moving diagonally upwards and to the right. His trajectory carries him from the middle ground toward the background as he elevates to dunk the basketball into the hoop in the upper right.",
