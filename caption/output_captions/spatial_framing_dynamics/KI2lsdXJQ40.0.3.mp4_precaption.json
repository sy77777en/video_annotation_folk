    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a pair of gray and white underwear with a blue waistband, which appears to be made of soft fabric and is laid flat. The underwear then transitions into a rolled-up form, with the blue waistband now forming a visible stripe along the length of the roll. As the camera moves, two other objects appear and also roll up: one is a pair of white underwear, and the other is a white short-sleeve t-shirt with a blue stripe. The transition between the subjects occurs as each item is manipulated from its original flat shape into a compact, cylindrical roll, highlighting the change in form and orientation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors on a floor made of horizontal wooden planks painted in a pale, weathered white with visible grain and subtle gaps between the boards. The lighting is even and natural, suggesting daytime. A small, soft fabric object, identified as a piece of gray underwear with a white band featuring a blue stripe, is present, initially laid out flat and later shown rolled into a compact cylindrical shape. The fabric has a slightly fuzzy texture, and its edges are neatly finished. As the camera moves, two additional objects appear: a white piece of underwear and a white short-sleeve t-shirt with a blue stripe. These objects are also initially laid out flat and gradually roll up. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present, and the scene remains uncluttered with a focus on the central objects and the textured wooden surface.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned above the subject when the first subject is in focus, and above the subject when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a pair of gray and white underwear with a blue waistband, laid flat in the center of the frame and positioned in the middle ground of the scene, with the camera directly above at a top-down angle. The underwear occupies the central area both horizontally and vertically, with the wooden floor filling the background. As the underwear is rolled up, it remains in the center of the frame and middle ground, transitioning from a flat, rectangular shape to a compact, cylindrical form, with the blue waistband forming a visible stripe along the roll. The camera maintains its top-down perspective and height throughout this transition. As the scene progresses, two additional objects\u2014a pair of white underwear and a white t-shirt with a blue stripe\u2014enter the frame from the top edge, moving into the center and middle ground. Each new item is initially laid flat in the center, then rolled up in place, maintaining their central position and middle ground depth. The camera remains above the subjects for all transitions, and the shot size stays consistent as a full shot for each main subject, with no significant changes in camera height or angle.",
