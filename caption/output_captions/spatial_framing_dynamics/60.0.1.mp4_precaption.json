    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **On a wooden surface, a clear drinking glass filled with water has a decal on its side showing a football player in a red uniform, posed against a large blue number \"14\". Next to the glass, a red pen with a white polka-dot pattern rests on a small, spiral-bound notebook with a brown cover. Behind the glass is a small, pink, pig-like figurine. In the background, two golden-colored trophies with black bases and a separate, entirely golden-colored trophy are visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene features several items arranged on a wooden surface against a textured, off-white wall. A clear glass of water, decorated with a sticker of a person in a red uniform, has the number '14' in blue on the glass itself. The glass rests on a brown, spiral-bound notebook. Beside the notebook lies a red pen with a white polka-dot pattern and a silver tip. Positioned behind the glass is a small, pink, creature-like figurine. In the background, two gold-colored trophies with black bases and a fully gold-colored trophy are visible but out of focus.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot, captured from a high angle, displays several items on a wooden surface. In the left foreground, a glass of water rests on a brown, spiral-bound notebook, with a red pen positioned on the notebook at the bottom left. A small pink figurine is located in the center middle ground, directly behind the glass. In the top right background, several out-of-focus trophies are visible, while a textured wall occupies the top left background.",
