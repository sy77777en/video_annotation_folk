    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A human foot, clad in a white cleat with black and orange details and a red sock featuring a white and blue pattern, is poised near a burst purple water balloon. The remnants of the balloon lie next to a dark green, circular kicking tee on green grass marked with a white line, with a spray of water droplets suspended in the air.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a close-up, objective shot of a green grass field, marked with a white line. A dark green, circular, low-profile object rests on the grass. A spray of water erupts, and a purple, fabric-like object is propelled through the water. A foot wearing a white cleat with red and dark blue accents on the sock area kicks through the water spray. The scene is brightly lit, suggesting daytime.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot features a dark green, circular kicking tee in the bottom left foreground, resting on green grass marked by a white line that extends diagonally from the bottom left foreground. In the center foreground, a purple water balloon is mid-burst, creating a large spray of water. A human foot, clad in a red sock and white cleat, is visible in the top right of the frame, moving into the center foreground to kick through the water spray. This kick displaces the remnants of the purple balloon, pushing them to the right foreground adjacent to the tee. The foot then continues its trajectory from the center foreground towards the top right, becoming more distinct before partially moving out of the frame. The dense water spray dissipates into airborne droplets. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
