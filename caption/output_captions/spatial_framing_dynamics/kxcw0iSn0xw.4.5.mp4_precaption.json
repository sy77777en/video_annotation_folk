    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two men engaged in a playful interaction with a large, colorful exercise ball. One man, wearing a light blue t-shirt and a red and grey baseball cap, is positioned in the foreground, with his face partially obscured. He has short, light brown hair and a light skin tone. The second man, standing slightly behind him, is wearing a dark t-shirt and is looking up with a smile, suggesting a lighthearted moment as he throws the ball at the first man's face. The exercise ball is predominantly turquoise with a gradient of pink, and its round shape contrasts with the angular lines of the basketball hoop in the background. The scene captures a moment of fun and camaraderie between the two men as they interact with the ball.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors during the day in a paved area, possibly a driveway, bordered by a low, tan stone retaining wall and a lawn. In the background, a basketball hoop with a white backboard and red rim is visible in front of a line of bare-branched trees and a parked white pickup truck. A large, inflatable exercise ball with a turquoise and pink tie-dye pattern is shown compressing and then flying up into the air, striking a man wearing a blue shirt and a backward baseball cap in the face, after which the ball bounces back. To the right, a small, colorful pinwheel is stuck in the ground. The weather is clear and sunny.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium shot, filmed at the subjects' level, initially frames a man in a blue shirt on the right foreground, with a large exercise ball pressed against the side of his head in the center foreground. The hands of a second man are visible on the far left foreground. In the middle ground, a low stone wall runs horizontally, with a white truck and a basketball hoop positioned behind it towards the center, and trees in the background. The man on the right then throws his head back, launching the ball upwards and towards the center of the frame, causing it to travel from the foreground into the middle ground. As the ball ascends, both men look up to follow its trajectory, with the second man on the left becoming more fully visible.",
