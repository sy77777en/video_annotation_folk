    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a man seated at a desk filled with electronic equipment. The man occupies the left side of the frame, while the desk and its contents fill the center and right. The desk, with multiple keyboards and a mouse, is in the foreground, and the man is slightly leaned forward, engaging with the equipment. The camera captures him at his level, maintaining a consistent height relative to the subject. As the video progresses, the shot size transitions to a close-up, focusing more on the man's hands and the glowing object he manipulates. This change brings the glowing object into the center of the frame, with the man's hands surrounding it. The desk and other equipment move out of focus, emphasizing the interaction between the hands and the glowing object. Throughout the video, the man remains in the left portion of the frame, while the glowing object shifts towards the center during the close-up. The camera maintains its position at the subject's level, ensuring a clear view of the actions taking place on the desk.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium build, wearing a long-sleeved shirt. He is seated at a desk with electronic equipment, including a few keyboards and a mouse. The scene has a dark green color filter, suggesting a night vision effect. The video is blurry and low resolution. The man is engaged in manipulating the equipment, with a focus on his hands interacting with a glowing object, possibly a small device or control. His posture is slightly leaned forward, indicating concentration on the task at hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an indoor setting with a dimly lit, night-vision effect, highlighting a person seated at a desk surrounded by multiple keyboards and electronic equipment with illuminated buttons and screens. The person interacts with the devices and holds a glowing object, with the green hue providing the primary visibility.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
