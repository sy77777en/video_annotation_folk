    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a watermelon is positioned in the center of the frame, resting in the middle ground on top of a cardboard box. The box is also centered and in the middle ground, situated below the watermelon. The background is filled with out-of-focus green trees. The watermelon explodes from its center, with the rind peeling back and pulp spraying outward from this central point. The main body of the fruit remains centered in the middle ground as it breaks apart. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A whole, oblong watermelon with a shiny, striped green rind sits atop a brown cardboard box. A small, white golf ball flies toward it and makes contact. Upon impact, the watermelon explodes in slow motion. A spray of red pulp and juice erupts from the center, while the green rind peels back in several pointed, star-like sections, revealing the bright red interior.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting with a soft-focus background of green trees, a whole watermelon with a green striped rind rests on a brown cardboard box. The scene is brightly lit. A golf ball strikes the watermelon, causing it to explode from the center, sending a spray of pink flesh and pieces of white and green rind flying outward. The force of the explosion creates a jagged, star-shaped opening in the top of the fruit. The cardboard box has clear tape on its top flaps and a small yellow sticker on its side.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
