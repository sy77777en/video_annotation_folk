    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially focuses on an ornate, circular, dark gray metal object, which features intricate scrollwork patterns radiating from a smaller, ribbed circle at its center. This object is part of a larger, dark structure. The focus then shifts to a rectangular, sepia-toned photograph with aged, torn edges, which is held in place on the right side of the structure. The photograph shows two figures, appearing to be an adult and a child, sitting together in a portrait.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit space, an ornate, dark metal wheel with intricate scrollwork patterns occupies the left foreground. The wheel features a central hub and a ridged inner circle. Near the metal wheel is a dark, jumbled collection of metal pieces that together form an intricate structure. To the right, a small, sepia-toned photograph held in a stand comes into focus, with the stand also being part of the structure. The scene is characterized by dramatic, focused lighting that illuminates these specific objects while leaving the surroundings in deep shadow. The camera's focus shifts from the metal wheel in the foreground to the photograph in the middleground.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: Close-up shot with a change of subject and focus switch between a symbol on a fence gate-like object to a picture on the gate.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot focused on an ornate, circular metal object positioned in the left foreground. A dark, complex structure occupies the middle ground, with a blurry, sepia-toned photograph visible in the upper right. The camera remains static as the focus shifts from the foreground object to the middle ground, a technique known as a rack focus. This transition brings the photograph, held in a stand on the right side of the frame, into sharp view. As a result, the circular object in the left foreground becomes blurred, emphasizing the depth between the two elements. The final composition maintains the close-up framing, with the photograph as the subject in the right middle ground and the out-of-focus circular object in the left foreground, all viewed from a relatively level camera height.",
