    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a red panda with reddish-brown fur, a bushy ringed tail, and black legs. The red panda moves on all fours, occasionally climbing onto a large, horizontal tree branch. Its face is marked with white patches around the eyes and muzzle, and its ears are upright and pointed. The animal\u2019s body is elongated and its tail is held out behind it as it navigates the area. The red panda\u2019s movements are agile and deliberate as it explores its environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors in a well-maintained, enclosed garden area with lush green grass, patches of bare earth, and a variety of low shrubs and plants. Several dark metal poles and a small climbing structure with wooden steps are positioned near the center, while a large, smooth, light-colored log lies horizontally across the ground, partially surrounded by vegetation. The setting is bright, indicating daytime with clear weather. A reddish-brown animal with a bushy tail moves through the scene, walking across the grass and interacting with the log and climbing structure. The environment is bordered by stone paths and landscaped features, creating a naturalistic yet organized appearance. No overlays or digital elements are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing the entire red panda as it moves through the scene. In the first frame, the red panda is positioned in the bottom left quadrant of the frame and occupies the foreground, walking on the grass parallel to a horizontal log that runs from the center right to the top left in the middle ground. Several dark metal poles and a small wooden climbing structure are centrally located in the middle ground, with the climbing steps facing the right side of the frame. The background consists of green shrubs, patches of bare earth, and stone paths, filling the upper and right portions of the frame. In the second frame, the red panda has moved toward the center and is partially climbing onto the horizontal log, now positioned in the middle ground near the central area of the frame. The camera remains above the subjects throughout, providing a clear top-down perspective of the red panda\u2019s movement and the spatial arrangement of the garden elements. No significant camera movement occurs, and the spatial relationships between the red panda, the climbing structure, and the log remain consistent as the animal transitions from the foreground to the middle ground.",
