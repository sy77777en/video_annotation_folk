    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with brown skin, long dark dreadlocks, a beard, and a mustache stands in a kitchen, facing forward and speaking. He wears a black sweater with a graphic of a brown camel with white decoration and white text on the front, and he is chopping a carrot with a knife on a wooden cutting board. In the background to the right, a woman with brown skin and dark hair pulled back sits on a counter. She is wearing a purple long-sleeved shirt under a pink and red apron and is looking down at a smartphone in her hands. The kitchen island and counter are covered with a large assortment of fresh produce, including multiple pineapples, bunches of bananas, apples, lemons, limes, oranges, and a head of purple cauliflower.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a modern kitchen with light-colored walls, wooden upper cabinets, and a stainless steel double-door refrigerator. In the foreground, a white countertop is overflowing with a vibrant assortment of fresh produce, including yellow bananas, pineapples, red and green apples, lemons, limes, oranges, and a purple cauliflower. A man wearing a black sweater with a camel graphic stands at a wooden cutting board, chopping a carrot. In the background, a woman in a colorful purple and pink outfit sits on the counter, looking at a smartphone. To the left, wooden brown shelves are mounted on the wall, holding various ceramic items and a small potted plant.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
