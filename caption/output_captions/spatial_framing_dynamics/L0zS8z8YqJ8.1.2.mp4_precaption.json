    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An aerial, high-angle view shows a long passenger train on a straight track. The train is composed of numerous light purple carriages, each with small, brightly illuminated rectangular windows. At the front of the train is a locomotive with red and grey markings. A white text overlay reading \"420 m\" is centered above the train, accompanied by a thin white line with arrows at both ends that spans the entire length of the train, indicating its measurement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a high-angle view of a long passenger train traveling at night. The train, composed of numerous carriages with light purple roofs and illuminated white windows, moves along a straight track that cuts through a dark, green, forested landscape. An overlay in the upper portion of the scene displays a white horizontal line with arrows, spanning the length of the train, with the text \"420 m\" centered above it.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This static, high-angle full shot captures the scene from a top-down perspective. A long passenger train is positioned horizontally across the center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. The train is flanked at the top and bottom by a dark, forested landscape. In the extreme foreground, a text overlay reading \"420 m\" is located in the top center, positioned directly above a horizontal white line with arrows that spans the length of the train. The train moves steadily from the right side of the frame toward the left.",
