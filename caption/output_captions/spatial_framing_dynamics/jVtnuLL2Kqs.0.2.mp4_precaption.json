    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a wide cityscape scenery shot capturing a dense urban skyline from across a river. The composition features a mix of architectural styles, with modern glass skyscrapers, including a distinctive building with a curved, flared top, rising behind older, classical-style stone buildings and a multi-tiered structure in the mid-ground. A stone arch bridge is visible on the left, and the scene is set under a dramatic sky filled with large, white and grey cumulus clouds against patches of blue.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A daytime view captures the London skyline from across the River Thames under a sky filled with large, white clouds. In the foreground, a railing is visible, with the dark water of the river behind it in the middleground. The cityscape is a mix of architectural styles, featuring prominent modern glass skyscrapers, including one with a distinctive curved, top-heavy shape, alongside older, beige stone buildings. On the left, an arched bridge spans the water. The video is presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom, and a white logo overlay is positioned in the lower right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static extreme wide shot of a city skyline. In the foreground, a dark railing extends across the bottom of the frame. The middle ground is occupied by a river, with an arched bridge positioned on the left. The cityscape itself is situated in the middle ground and background; older, beige buildings are located in the center-left, while modern skyscrapers, including a prominent one with a curved top, rise behind them in the center and center-right of the frame. The sky and clouds fill the top portion of the frame in the background. The camera is positioned at a low angle from across the river, looking slightly up at the buildings. The video is presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom, and a logo is overlaid in the bottom right corner.",
