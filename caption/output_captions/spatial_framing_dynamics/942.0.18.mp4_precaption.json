    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with light skin and short, reddish-blond hair lies on his back, wearing a red and white athletic shirt over a red ribbed knit shirt, paired with red shorts that have the white number \"10\" on the left side. He is also wearing a knee-high sock on his right foot. He supports his head with his right hand and holds his bent left leg with his left hand, exposing the sole of his bare left foot. To his right, another man with light skin sits, wearing a blue jacket paired with blue pants, sky blue fingerless gloves, and a black beanie with a blue pom-pom, looking towards the reclining man. On the left, a hand wearing a light blue glove, attached to an arm in a blue sleeve, inspects the reclining man's exposed foot. Initially, only the head of the man in blue is visible at the bottom, but as the view tilts down, more of both men's bodies and the interaction with the foot become apparent.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place indoors, featuring a dark backdrop with a textured surface resembling a night sky or a theatrical set. The environment is dimly lit, with a focus on a small, elevated platform covered in a blue material. On this platform, a person in a red sports uniform is lying down, holding their knee, while another person in blue attire, including a beanie, sits beside them. The setting suggests a medical or supportive context, with a white megaphone and a silver case nearby, possibly for communication or equipment. The overall atmosphere is intimate and focused, with the dark surroundings contrasting against the vivid colors of the clothing and props.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a man in red lying down, one hand supporting his head and the other holding a leg, exposing his foot's sole. On the left, a hand inspects his foot, while a man in blue sits on the right. Initially, only the blue man's head is visible at the bottom, but as the camera tilts down, it gradually reveals more parts of both men's bodies.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This high-angle medium shot initially frames the subjects in the lower portion of the screen against a dark, textured background. A man in a red uniform lies in the bottom center foreground, with his bare left foot held by a gloved hand on the far bottom left. To his right, in the bottom right foreground, sits a man in a blue beanie. A yellow lightning bolt graphic occupies the top right corner of the background. The camera then tilts down, shifting the composition. This movement reveals more of the man in red's body and a bag next to him in the foreground, while the lightning bolt graphic moves out of the top of the frame, focusing the view more tightly on the interaction between the figures.",
