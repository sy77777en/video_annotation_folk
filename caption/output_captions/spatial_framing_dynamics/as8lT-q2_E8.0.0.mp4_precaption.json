    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a person riding a futuristic, sleek black motorcycle with glowing yellow-orange lines accentuating its form. The rider is clad in a matching black suit and a full-face helmet, both of which are also detailed with the same yellow-orange glowing strips. The motorcycle features two bright white rectangular headlights and a glowing \"C\" symbol on its side. Flanking this central figure are four other riders on nearly identical motorcycles; however, their vehicles and suits are distinguished by glowing red-orange accents. The group is shown first in a V-formation with the yellow-accented motorcycle at the front, and then racing at high speed, leaving behind solid walls of light that match the color of their respective accents.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a high-speed race within a vast, dark indoor stadium at night. The arena's track is a wide, black, reflective surface marked with glowing blue-green lines. In the background, tiered seating and structural elements are illuminated by cool blue lights, with a single, thin, curved light suspended overhead. Sleek, futuristic motorcycles, one with yellow accents and others with red-orange accents, speed along the track, leaving behind solid, glowing trails of light in their respective colors. The camera's perspective shifts, following the vehicles and providing high-angle views of the race in progress.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, showing a group of five motorcycles in a V-formation in the middle ground. The main, yellow-accented motorcycle is positioned in the center of the frame, with two red-accented motorcycles on its left and two on its right. The camera, initially at the subjects' level, moves forward into a close-up on the central rider, who remains in the center of the frame. The perspective then shifts to a high-angle view as the camera pulls back into an extreme wide shot, looking down on the race. From this vantage point, the main subject speeds down the center of the track away from the camera, while the other four motorcycles race on the left and right sides, all moving from the middle ground toward the background.",
