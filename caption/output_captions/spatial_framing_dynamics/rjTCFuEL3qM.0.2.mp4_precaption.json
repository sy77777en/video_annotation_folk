    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This abstract animation features numerous small, glowing blue particles and thin, vertical streaks of blue light converging toward a bright, cyan-colored light source located at the top center of the scene. The particles, varying in brightness, create a sparkling effect as they rise against a dark, deep-blue background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a dark blue and black background, a bright cyan light emanates from the top center of the scene. Numerous glowing, star-like particles and thin vertical streaks of light converge toward this source from the surrounding dark space. The particles, varying in brightness, drift upwards, creating a continuous, gentle cascade of blue light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "In this abstract scene, a bright cyan light source is fixed at the top center in the background. From this source, thin, vertical streaks of blue light extend downwards through the middle ground, concentrated in the center and fanning out slightly to the left and right. Numerous small, glowing blue particles are scattered throughout the frame, occupying both the foreground and middle ground. These particles continuously drift upwards from the bottom of the frame, converging toward the central light source at the top. The camera remains static, maintaining a fixed view of the upward-flowing light.",
