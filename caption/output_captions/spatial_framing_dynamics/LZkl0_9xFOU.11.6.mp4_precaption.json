    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A faceless animated boy with short, styled brown hair is depicted from the chest up. He wears a white t-shirt that appears greenish due to the room's green lighting and sits in a dark green chair, turned slightly to his right. The boy holds a green mobile phone with a dark outline to his right ear with his right hand, his head tilted down as if listening intently. His arms have visible joints at the elbow and wrist, giving him a mannequin-like appearance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a room illuminated by a strong green light cast from an unseen source and a single hanging lamp. A faceless, animated figure with brown hair sits in a green chair at a wooden desk, holding a phone to its ear. On the desk are two pieces of electronic equipment: one with a grid of buttons and small red lights, and another slightly angled to the right. In the background, a dark wooden cabinet with glass frames on the upper part of its doors stands against the green wall. A blank white rectangle with a small triangular section missing is mounted on the wall to the left. White subtitles are positioned in the lower left corner of the screen, displaying \"[27]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium close-up shot frames a faceless animated boy in the center-left of the middle ground. He is seated at a desk that occupies the right side of the middle ground, with electronic equipment positioned on it. In the background, a wooden cabinet stands on the right, a white rectangle is mounted on the left wall, and a hanging lamp is visible in the top left corner. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
