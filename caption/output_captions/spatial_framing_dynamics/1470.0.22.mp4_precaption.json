    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a child wearing a colorful, patterned outfit and a bright red hat. The child has light skin and medium-length hair, and they are actively moving on a bed. Despite the dynamic motion, the child's expression suggests they might be crying, making them the main focus with their actions and attire drawing attention.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting, likely a bedroom, characterized by a cozy and personalized atmosphere. The room features a bed with light-colored pillows and bedding, and the head of the bed is a dark frame structure. The walls are adorned with colorful, abstract artwork and decorative elements, including a series of small, dark plane-shaped decorations. A window with blinds allows natural light to filter in, suggesting daytime. A lit table lamp adds to the ambiance. The overall color scheme is vibrant. The environment is lively, with a sense of motion as a subject moves energetically across the bed, wearing a colorful outfit and a red hat. The scene captures a dynamic and playful moment within a creatively decorated space.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of the child, who is positioned in the foreground, occupying the center of the frame. The child is actively moving on the bed, which is situated in the middle ground, slightly towards the bottom of the frame. The bed's light-colored pillows and bedding are visible, along with the dark frame structure of the headboard. The child's colorful outfit and red hat stand out prominently. As the video progresses, the shot size transitions to a full shot, capturing more of the surrounding environment. The child continues to move dynamically, shifting from the center towards the right side of the frame. The background includes colorful abstract artwork and small plane-shaped decorations on the walls, located towards the top and sides of the frame. A window with blinds is visible in the upper right corner, allowing natural light to enter. A lit table lamp is positioned in the bottom left corner, adding to the room's ambiance. Throughout the video, the camera remains at the subject's level, maintaining a consistent perspective relative to the child's height. The transition from medium to full shot expands the view, revealing more of the room while keeping the child as the central focus.",
