    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up of a man in the foreground, positioned slightly left of center. A light-colored mantelpiece edge is visible in the middle ground, running horizontally across the lower portion of the frame. The background features an opulent room with out-of-focus candlelight creating bokeh effects, primarily in the top right and center. The camera then executes a rack focus, causing the man in the foreground to blur while bringing into focus the reflection of a woman in a large mirror that occupies the background. Her reflected head and shoulders are positioned slightly to the right of the mirror's center and in the upper-middle of the overall frame. In-focus candles become visible in the background, both directly in the room (top right) and within the mirror's reflection, notably to the right of the woman. Ornate, gilded wall details frame the mirror in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially focuses on a man with dark hair, prominent dark sideburns, and a serious expression. He is wearing a dark formal jacket over a white high-collared shirt and a colorful, intricately patterned cravat or waistcoat. He is positioned facing slightly to his left. The focus then shifts to a reflection in a mirror behind him, revealing a woman. Only her head and shoulders are visible in the reflection; she appears to have dark brown hair styled up and is looking towards the man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, in a dimly lit, opulent room, likely during the evening or night, as suggested by the warm glow of numerous candles. The background features ornate, gilded wall details and a large mirror reflecting the candlelight and figures within the room. A prominent mantelpiece with a light-colored edge is situated in the middleground. The overall ambiance is one of historical elegance, with a focus on the rich textures and warm, flickering light.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video transitions from a medium close-up of a man to the reflection of a woman in a mirror behind him through rack focus. The woman is only partially visible, showing her head and shoulders, occupying approximately 30% of the frame's height.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
