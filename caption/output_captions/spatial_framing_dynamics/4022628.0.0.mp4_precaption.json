    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video provides an extreme close-up view of two orange slices. Initially, the upper slice is positioned slightly above and to the right, displaying its vibrant orange pulp and distinct white pith beneath the peel. The lower slice, occupying the bottom left portion of the view, reveals its bright orange, juicy, segmented flesh and a similar white pith layer. Both slices exhibit a glistening, wet texture on their cut surfaces.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This extreme close-up video showcases two bright orange slices, one above the other, set against a warm brown background. The camera moves slowly across the glistening, juicy flesh of the oranges, emphasizing their segmented texture and the white pith separating the flesh from the rind. The vibrant orange color of the fruit stands out throughout the shot. Midway through the video, a soft, light-colored glow appears between the two slices, adding an extra layer of visual interest.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There isn't enough background information to determine the camera's position relative to the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme close-up shot. Initially, an upper orange slice is framed in the top right foreground, and a lower orange slice is in the bottom left foreground. A brown surface constitutes the background, visible in the top left area. Throughout the shot, the camera executes a slow pan to the left. This movement causes the upper orange slice to transition from its initial top right position, increasingly occupying the top left and top center foreground. Concurrently, the lower orange slice shifts from its initial bottom left position, progressively filling the bottom center and bottom right foreground. Consequently, by the end of the video, the two orange slices dominate more of the frame, diminishing the visible portion of the brown background in the top left.",
