    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle perspective, looking up at a vast interior wall. The tiled wall fills the majority of the frame, stretching diagonally from the bottom towards the top right. Numerous small, illuminated windows are positioned across the middle ground of the wall's surface. In the background at the top of the frame, a long, bright light fixture runs horizontally, partially obscured by the ceiling which is visible at the top edge.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot capturing a disorienting, low-angle view looking up a vast, tiled wall. The wall, made of small, pale green tiles, is dotted with numerous identical, small rectangular windows that are brightly illuminated from within. A long, intensely bright light fixture runs along the top of the frame, casting a sterile, hazy glow over the scene and creating a sense of immense height. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the overwhelming scale and repetitive, minimalist pattern of the environment, which evokes a sterile and surreal atmosphere rather than highlighting a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective, a tall interior wall stretches upwards towards a partially visible ceiling. The wall is uniformly covered in a grid of small, pale green square tiles. Embedded in the wall at various heights are multiple rectangular windows with white frames, all glowing with a bright, uniform white light. A long, linear light source at the top of the scene casts a bright, hazy illumination over the entire surface.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
