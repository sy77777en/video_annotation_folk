    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A stylized, cartoon-like depiction of planet Earth is shown against a black, star-filled background. The planet is a sphere with green landmasses, blue oceans, and swirling white clouds, all outlined in purple. A large, pink, rectangular prism, resembling a truck, is also present. The pink truck is initially seen in space near the camera and is later shown moving away from the camera toward the planet, eventually disappearing on the planet's surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a cartoon depiction of outer space, against a black backdrop dotted with white stars, a large, pink, rectangular object floats. The object moves toward a stylized, spherical Earth, which has green continents, blue oceans, and white, swirling clouds. The scene concludes with the pink object landing on the planet's surface, where it completely disappears in a flashing effect among the clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot featuring a large, pink, rectangular object in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. In the background, positioned to the left of the center, is a stylized planet Earth. The pink object moves away from the camera, traveling from the right side toward the planet in the background and shrinking in size as it recedes. The shot then transitions to a wide shot, with the planet now centered and appearing larger in the frame. The pink object is briefly visible on the planet's surface before it disappears, leaving the centered planet against the star-filled background.",
