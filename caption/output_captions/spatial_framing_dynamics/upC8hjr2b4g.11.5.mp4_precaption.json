    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A variety of pharmaceutical pills and capsules are scattered across a flat, greenish-blue surface. The assortment includes two-toned capsules, some of which are half red and half white, while others are half orange and half white. Solid red and purple capsules are also present. Interspersed among these are round, flat tablets in various colors, including light blue and green. A few translucent, brownish, spherical gel caps are also mixed in with the pile. The medications are loosely grouped, with several individual pills and capsules lying apart from the main cluster.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting with a cool, blue-green ambiance, a variety of pills and capsules are scattered across a light-colored surface. The collection includes red-and-white, red-and-orange, and solid red or purple capsules, alongside round tablets in green and blue, and a few translucent gel caps. The background is dark and out of focus, drawing attention to the medication. As the perspective slowly moves from right to left, there is an overlay consistently located in the bottom-left corner displaying \"[26].\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a full shot of various pills and capsules scattered on a flat surface, filmed from the subjects' level. A dense cluster of multi-colored pills and capsules occupies the center-right of the frame in the middle ground. In the foreground, several individual red and red-and-white capsules are spread out from the bottom-center to the bottom-left. The background consists of a dark, out-of-focus area at the top of the frame. The camera slowly pans from right to left, causing the foreground pills to drift across the bottom of the screen and the central cluster to shift towards the left side of the frame.",
