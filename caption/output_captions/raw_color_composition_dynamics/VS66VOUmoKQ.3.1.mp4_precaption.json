    "pre_caption": "The video features a harmonious blend of colors, with a neutral color temperature that maintains a balanced and natural appearance. The color saturation is well-adjusted, presenting a vivid yet realistic depiction of the subjects. The orange and black handles of the utility knives stand out against the gray packaging, creating a pleasing contrast. The metallic blades reflect light subtly, adding a touch of brightness without overpowering the scene. The background elements, including the scattered tools and packaging, contribute to a cohesive and visually engaging composition.",
