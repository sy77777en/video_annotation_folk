    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the color composition and dynamics in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **color type, temperature, saturation, brightness, and grading**. Your goal is to describe the **overall color characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **color type** by stating whether the video is black-and-white or colored. If colored, describe the dominant colors of **major subjects and scene elements** such as clothing, sky, water, trees, buildings, and vehicles. Highlight any **salient or unusual colors** that enhance visual appeal.\n\nNext, describe the **overall color temperature** as **warm, cool, or neutral**. If the video contains both warm and cool elements, describe their contrast. If temperature changes throughout the video, specify the **initial and final states**.\n\nThen, describe the **color saturation**, indicating whether it is **high, neutral, or low**. Mention any **contrasting saturation elements**, such as a highly saturated neon sign in a desaturated environment. If saturation changes, specify how colors transition over time.\n\nSpecify the **overall brightness level** as **very bright, bright, neutral, dark, or very dark**. If different areas of the scene contrast in brightness, describe this relationship. If brightness changes, specify the **transition**.\n\nFinally, describe any **color grading effects** that influence the video\u2019s temperature, saturation, or brightness. If a distinct grading style is present, such as a **teal-and-orange filter** or **monochrome desaturation**, include it.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of color composition. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video has noticeable shifts between warm and cool color tones.\n\n**Color Saturation:** The video mainly features desaturated colors, making hues appear muted or grayish.\n\n**Brightness and Exposure:** The video is predominantly dark with dim lighting but not so underexposed that most details are lost.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is colored, with dominant hues of muted greens and grays in the forest setting, and a notable orange-brown in the protective suit. The color temperature shifts between cool tones in the environment and the warmer tones of the suit, creating a stark contrast. The overall color saturation is low, giving the scene a subdued, almost monochromatic feel, with the suit providing a rare pop of color. The brightness level is predominantly dark, with dim lighting that maintains enough detail to discern the scene's elements. The color grading enhances the cool, desaturated atmosphere, emphasizing the somber and eerie mood of the setting.",
