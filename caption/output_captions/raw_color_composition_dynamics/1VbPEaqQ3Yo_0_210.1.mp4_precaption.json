    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the color composition and dynamics in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **color type, temperature, saturation, brightness, and grading**. Your goal is to describe the **overall color characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **color type** by stating whether the video is black-and-white or colored. If colored, describe the dominant colors of **major subjects and scene elements** such as clothing, sky, water, trees, buildings, and vehicles. Highlight any **salient or unusual colors** that enhance visual appeal.\n\nNext, describe the **overall color temperature** as **warm, cool, or neutral**. If the video contains both warm and cool elements, describe their contrast. If temperature changes throughout the video, specify the **initial and final states**.\n\nThen, describe the **color saturation**, indicating whether it is **high, neutral, or low**. Mention any **contrasting saturation elements**, such as a highly saturated neon sign in a desaturated environment. If saturation changes, specify how colors transition over time.\n\nSpecify the **overall brightness level** as **very bright, bright, neutral, dark, or very dark**. If different areas of the scene contrast in brightness, describe this relationship. If brightness changes, specify the **transition**.\n\nFinally, describe any **color grading effects** that influence the video\u2019s temperature, saturation, or brightness. If a distinct grading style is present, such as a **teal-and-orange filter** or **monochrome desaturation**, include it.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of color composition. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video's color palette is neutral, with no strong warm or cool tones standing out. (no need to mention).\n\n**Color Saturation:** The video mainly features desaturated colors (but not full black and white), making hues appear muted or grayish.\n\n**Brightness and Exposure:** The video shows a scene with predominantly dim lighting, but some details remain visible and are not completely underexposed.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Make your paragraph concise and simple, including as many video details as possible, without mentioning what is not present.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is in color, but the palette is heavily desaturated, giving it a muted, grayish appearance. The dominant colors are dark shades of gray and black, with subtle hints of purple and white highlights that add depth to the scene. The overall color temperature is neutral, with no strong warm or cool tones. The saturation is low, contributing to the somber and subdued atmosphere. The brightness level is dark, with dim lighting that maintains visibility of key details without being completely underexposed. The color grading enhances the moody and mysterious ambiance, emphasizing the shadowy and ethereal elements of the scene.",
