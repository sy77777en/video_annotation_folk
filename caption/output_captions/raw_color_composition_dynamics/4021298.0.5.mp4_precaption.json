    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the color composition and dynamics in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **color type, temperature, saturation, brightness, and grading**. Your goal is to describe the **overall color characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **color type** by stating whether the video is black-and-white or colored. If colored, describe the dominant colors of **major subjects and scene elements** such as clothing, sky, water, trees, buildings, and vehicles. Highlight any **salient or unusual colors** that enhance visual appeal.\n\nNext, describe the **overall color temperature** as **warm, cool, or neutral**. If the video contains both warm and cool elements, describe their contrast. If temperature changes throughout the video, specify the **initial and final states**.\n\nThen, describe the **color saturation**, indicating whether it is **high, neutral, or low**. Mention any **contrasting saturation elements**, such as a highly saturated neon sign in a desaturated environment. If saturation changes, specify how colors transition over time.\n\nSpecify the **overall brightness level** as **very bright, bright, neutral, dark, or very dark**. If different areas of the scene contrast in brightness, describe this relationship. If brightness changes, specify the **transition**.\n\nFinally, describe any **color grading effects** that influence the video\u2019s temperature, saturation, or brightness. If a distinct grading style is present, such as a **teal-and-orange filter** or **monochrome desaturation**, include it.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of color composition. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video's color palette is neutral, with neither warm nor cool tones being dominant.\n\n**Color Saturation:** The video has balanced color saturation, not dominated by overly vivid or grayish hues.\n\n**Brightness and Exposure:** The video is well-lit with strong lighting, making the scene bright and clear but not overexposed.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is colored, featuring a landscape dominated by earthy tones such as browns and tans from the rocky terrain and camels. The sky is a clear blue, providing a striking contrast to the warm hues of the rocks and ground. Clothing worn by people includes a mix of reds, blues, and neutral colors, adding variety to the scene. The overall color temperature is warm, accentuated by the sunlight casting a golden glow over the landscape. The color saturation is balanced, with natural tones that are neither overly vivid nor muted, maintaining a realistic depiction of the environment. The brightness level is bright, with strong natural lighting illuminating the scene clearly, enhancing the visibility of details without causing overexposure. There is no distinct color grading effect, allowing the natural colors and lighting to define the visual experience.",
