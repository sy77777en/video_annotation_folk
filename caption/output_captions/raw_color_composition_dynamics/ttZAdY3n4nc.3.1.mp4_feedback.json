    "pre_caption": "The video is colored, with dominant warm tones such as browns, oranges, and yellows, particularly in the clothing and the surrounding buildings. The sky has a subtle gradient, adding to the warm ambiance. The overall color temperature is warm, enhancing the earthy and rustic feel of the scene. The saturation is balanced, maintaining a natural yet vivid appearance without being overly intense. The brightness level is neutral, providing clear visibility of details without harsh contrasts. The color grading emphasizes the warm tones, possibly using a subtle sepia filter to enhance the nostalgic and historical atmosphere of the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the color composition and dynamics in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **color type, tone, temperature, saturation, colorfulness, brightness, and grading**. Your goal is to describe the **overall color characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **color type** by stating whether the video is black-and-white or colored. If colored, describe the dominant colors of **major subjects and scene elements** such as clothing, sky, water, trees, buildings, and vehicles. Highlight any **salient or unusual colors** that enhance visual appeal.\n\nNext, describe the **overall color temperature** as **warm, cool, or neutral**. If the video contains both warm and cool elements, describe their contrast. If temperature changes throughout the video, specify the **initial and final states**.\n\nThen, describe the **colorfulness and saturation**, indicating whether it is **high, neutral, or low** colorfulness. Mention any **contrast** in colorfulness within the frame, such as a highly saturated neon sign in a desaturated environment. If colorfulness or saturation changes, specify how colors transition over time.\n\nSpecify the **overall brightness level** as **very bright, bright, neutral, dark, or very dark**. If different areas of the scene contrast in brightness, describe this relationship. If brightness changes, specify the **transition**.\n\nFinally, describe any **color grading effects** that influence the video\u2019s temperature, saturation, or brightness. If a distinct grading style is present, such as a **teal-and-orange filter** or **monochrome desaturation**, include it.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of color composition. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video predominantly features warm colors, such as reds, oranges, or yellows.\n\n**Color Saturation:** The video features striking contrasts between regions of high and low colorfulness (saturation), with noticeable shifts in colorfulness (saturation) between high, neutral, and low levels across large parts of the scene.\n\n**Brightness and Exposure:** The video shows a scene with balanced illumination, with no large areas that are too bright (overexposed) or too dark (underexposed). (no need to mention).\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Make your paragraph concise and simple, including as many video details as possible, without mentioning what is not present.",
