    "pre_caption": "The video showcases a dynamic interplay of colors, transitioning between cool and warm tones. Initially, the scene is dominated by cool blues and purples, creating a futuristic and sleek atmosphere with neon accents. As the video progresses, it shifts to a warm, intense red, enhancing the dramatic and energetic mood. The balanced saturation ensures that the colors remain vivid without overwhelming the viewer. Brightness levels vary, adding depth and contrast to the scene, while the exposure is well-managed to highlight the vibrant hues and maintain clarity throughout.",

DO NOT USE ANY NEGATIVE WORDS \u2014 this includes \u201cwithout\u201d, \u201cno\u201d, \u201cneither\u201d, or similar.\n2. FOLLOW our guidance below on color temperature, saturation, brightness, exposure, and grading.\n3. If anything is NEUTRAL or UNREMARKABLE, explain WHY \u2014 do NOT repeat the guidance.\n4. BE CONCISE, NATURAL, CLEAR, and OBJECTIVE.\n5. RETURN ONLY THE DESCRIPTION PARAGRAPH \u2014 DO NOT add any commentary or explanation.\n6. This is a color analysis task. DO NOT make assumptions or subjective judgments.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of color composition. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video has noticeable shifts between warm and cool color tones.\n\n**Color Saturation:** The video has balanced color saturation, not dominated by overly vivid or grayish hues. (no need to mention).\n\n**Brightness and Exposure:** The video\u2019s brightness level changes over time.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately.",
