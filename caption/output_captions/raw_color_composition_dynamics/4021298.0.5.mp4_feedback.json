    "pre_caption": "The video is colored, featuring a landscape dominated by earthy tones such as browns and tans from the rocky terrain and camels. The sky is a clear blue, providing a striking contrast to the warm hues of the rocks and ground. Clothing worn by people includes a mix of reds, blues, and neutral colors, adding variety to the scene. The overall color temperature is warm, accentuated by the sunlight casting a golden glow over the landscape. The color saturation is balanced, with natural tones that are neither overly vivid nor muted, maintaining a realistic depiction of the environment. The brightness level is bright, with strong natural lighting illuminating the scene clearly, enhancing the visibility of details without causing overexposure. There is no distinct color grading effect, allowing the natural colors and lighting to define the visual experience.",
