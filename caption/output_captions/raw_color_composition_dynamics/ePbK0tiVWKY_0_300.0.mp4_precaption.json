Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video's color palette is neutral, with neither warm nor cool tones being dominant. (no need to mention).\n\n**Color Saturation:** The video has balanced color saturation, not dominated by overly vivid or grayish hues. (no need to mention).\n\n**Brightness and Exposure:** The video is predominantly dark with dim lighting but not so underexposed that most details are lost.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a cityscape at night, characterized by a predominantly dark atmosphere with dim lighting that maintains visibility of details. The scene is illuminated by scattered bright lights from buildings and vehicles, creating a dynamic contrast against the night sky. A large digital billboard displays a vivid image, adding a splash of color and light to the scene. The overall color palette is balanced, with neither warm nor cool tones prevailing, and the saturation is moderate, ensuring the colors are neither overly vivid nor dull. The exposure is well-managed, allowing the intricate details of the urban environment to be discernible despite the low-light setting.",
