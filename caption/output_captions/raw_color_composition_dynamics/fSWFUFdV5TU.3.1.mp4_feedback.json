    "pre_caption": "The video features a scene with a door at the center, flanked by framed artwork on both sides. The color palette is neutral, with balanced saturation that maintains a natural look. The brightness and exposure are complex, creating a moody atmosphere with soft lighting. A lamp on the left side casts a warm glow, adding subtle highlights to the scene, while the rest of the room remains in gentle shadow, enhancing the overall depth and texture.",

FOLLOW our guidance below on color temperature, saturation, brightness, exposure, and grading.\n3. If anything is NEUTRAL or UNREMARKABLE, explain WHY \u2014 do NOT repeat the guidance.\n4. BE CONCISE, NATURAL, CLEAR, and OBJECTIVE.\n5. RETURN ONLY THE DESCRIPTION PARAGRAPH \u2014 DO NOT add any commentary or explanation.\n6. This is a color analysis task. DO NOT make assumptions or subjective judgments.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of color composition. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video's color palette is neutral, with neither warm nor cool tones being dominant. (no need to mention).\n\n**Color Saturation:** The video has balanced color saturation, not dominated by overly vivid or grayish hues.
