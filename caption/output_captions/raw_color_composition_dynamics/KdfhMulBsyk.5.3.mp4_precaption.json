    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a clear and concise description of the subjects and scene elements in the video, covering their color temperature, saturation, brightness, exposure, and any potential color grading effects. Refer to it as \"The video\" and describe the entire video by combining details from the first and last frames. Only describe what is visible and certain, using simple, natural English to create a coherent paragraph that focuses on the most essential details. Avoid using subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **color type** by stating whether the video is black-and-white or colored. If colored, describe the dominant colors of **major subjects and scene elements** such as clothing, sky, water, trees, buildings, and vehicles. Highlight any **salient or unusual colors** that enhance visual appeal.\n\nNext, describe the **overall color temperature** as **warm, cool, or neutral**. If the video contains both warm and cool elements, describe their contrast. If temperature changes throughout the video, specify the **initial and final states**.\n\nThen, describe the **color saturation**, indicating whether it is **high, neutral, or low**. Mention any **contrasting saturation elements**, such as a highly saturated neon sign in a desaturated environment. If saturation changes, specify how colors transition over time.\n\nSpecify the **overall brightness level** as **very bright, bright, neutral, dark, or very dark**. If different areas of the scene contrast in brightness, describe this relationship. If brightness changes, specify the **transition**.\n\nFinally, describe any **color grading effects** that influence the video\u2019s temperature, saturation, or brightness. If a distinct grading style is present, such as a **teal-and-orange filter** or **monochrome desaturation**, include it.\n\nWe have already provided some brief guidance on describing aspects of color composition, including color temperature, saturation, brightness, exposure, and color grading effects. However, these guidelines are overly brief and should only be used as references. Expand your description with more specific details, ensuring clarity, coherence, and conciseness. Focus on accurately describing what is visible in the video without making assumptions or using subjective language. Return only the description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video predominantly features warm colors, such as reds, oranges, or yellows.\n\n**Color Saturation:** The video has noticeable shifts in color saturation between high and low over time.\n\n**Brightness and Exposure:** The video\u2019s brightness level changes over time.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is colored, featuring dominant warm hues such as reds and oranges. The major subjects, including the characters, are illuminated by these warm tones, creating a visually striking contrast against the darker background. The overall color temperature is warm, with no significant cool elements present. The color saturation shifts noticeably, starting with high saturation that enhances the vividness of the reds and oranges, and transitioning to lower saturation towards the end, where colors appear more subdued. The brightness level changes over time, beginning with a bright scene where the subjects are clearly visible, and gradually becoming darker, reducing visibility and emphasizing the warm glow. There are no distinct color grading effects beyond the warm tones and saturation shifts, contributing to the dynamic visual experience.",
