    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the color composition and dynamics in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **color type, temperature, saturation, brightness, and grading**. Your goal is to describe the **overall color characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **color type** by stating whether the video is black-and-white or colored. If colored, describe the dominant colors of **major subjects and scene elements** such as clothing, sky, water, trees, buildings, and vehicles. Highlight any **salient or unusual colors** that enhance visual appeal.\n\nNext, describe the **overall color temperature** as **warm, cool, or neutral**. If the video contains both warm and cool elements, describe their contrast. If temperature changes throughout the video, specify the **initial and final states**.\n\nThen, describe the **color saturation**, indicating whether it is **high, neutral, or low**. Mention any **contrasting saturation elements**, such as a highly saturated neon sign in a desaturated environment. If saturation changes, specify how colors transition over time.\n\nSpecify the **overall brightness level** as **very bright, bright, neutral, dark, or very dark**. If different areas of the scene contrast in brightness, describe this relationship. If brightness changes, specify the **transition**.\n\nFinally, describe any **color grading effects** that influence the video\u2019s temperature, saturation, or brightness. If a distinct grading style is present, such as a **teal-and-orange filter** or **monochrome desaturation**, include it.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of color composition. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video's color palette is neutral, with neither warm nor cool tones being dominant.\n\n**Color Saturation:** The video has balanced color saturation, not dominated by overly vivid or grayish hues.\n\n**Brightness and Exposure:** The video\u2019s brightness is balanced, neither too bright nor too dark.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is colored, with dominant earthy tones such as browns and greens, reflecting the natural environment. The elephant's skin is a rich brown, while the surrounding vegetation features various shades of green and beige. The overall color temperature is warm, enhancing the natural and organic feel of the scene. The color saturation is neutral, providing a realistic depiction without overly vivid or muted hues. The brightness level is balanced, allowing for clear visibility of details without any areas being too bright or too dark. There is no distinct color grading effect, maintaining a natural and authentic look throughout the video.",
