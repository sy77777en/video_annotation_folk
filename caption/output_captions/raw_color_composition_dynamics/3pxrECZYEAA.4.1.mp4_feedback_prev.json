    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the color composition and dynamics in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **color type, tone, temperature, saturation, colorfulness, brightness, and grading**. Your goal is to describe the **overall color characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **color type** by stating whether the video is black-and-white or colored. If colored, describe the dominant colors of **major subjects and scene elements** such as clothing, sky, water, trees, buildings, and vehicles. Highlight any **salient or unusual colors** that enhance visual appeal.\n\nNext, describe the **overall color temperature** as **warm, cool, or neutral**. If the video contains both warm and cool elements, describe their contrast. If temperature changes throughout the video, specify the **initial and final states**.\n\nThen, describe the **colorfulness and saturation**, indicating whether it is **high, neutral, or low** colorfulness. Mention any **contrast** in colorfulness within the frame, such as a highly saturated neon sign in a desaturated environment. If colorfulness or saturation changes, specify how colors transition over time.\n\nSpecify the **overall brightness level** as **very bright, bright, neutral, dark, or very dark**. If different areas of the scene contrast in brightness, describe this relationship. If brightness changes, specify the **transition**.\n\nFinally, describe any **color grading effects** that influence the video\u2019s temperature, saturation, or brightness. If a distinct grading style is present, such as a **teal-and-orange filter** or **monochrome desaturation**, include it.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of color composition. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video has noticeable shifts between warm and cool color tones.\n\n**Color Saturation:** The video features striking contrasts between regions of high and low colorfulness (saturation), with noticeable shifts in colorfulness (saturation) between high, neutral, and low levels across large parts of the scene.\n\n**Brightness and Exposure:** The overall brightness or exposure of the video changes over time, with noticeable shifts between brighter and darker levels across large portions of the frame.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Make your paragraph concise and simple, including as many video details as possible, without mentioning what is not present.",
    "pre_caption": "This colored animation transitions from dark green tree silhouettes to a bright, expansive landscape dominated by vibrant green hills and trees beneath a light blue sky with white clouds. An orange road winds through the scene, and a salient, bright red bird flies prominently across the frame. The color temperature presents a contrast between the cool greens and blues of the environment and the warm tones of the red bird and orange road. Colorfulness and saturation shift significantly, starting low in the dark opening and becoming high and vibrant in the main landscape scene. Similarly, the video's brightness undergoes a major transition from very dark to very bright. The colors appear clean and direct, consistent with a flat animation style, without complex grading effects.",
