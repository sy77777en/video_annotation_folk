    "pre_caption_prompt": "DESCRIBE the colors of the subjects and/or scene in this video in ONE PARAGRAPH ONLY. Your response MUST follow the rules below:\n\n1. DO NOT USE ANY NEGATIVE WORDS \u2014 this includes \u201cwithout\u201d, \u201cno\u201d, \u201cneither\u201d, or similar.\n2. FOLLOW our guidance below on color temperature, saturation, brightness, exposure, and grading.\n3. If anything is NEUTRAL or UNREMARKABLE, explain WHY \u2014 do NOT repeat the guidance.\n4. BE CONCISE, NATURAL, CLEAR, and OBJECTIVE.\n5. RETURN ONLY THE DESCRIPTION PARAGRAPH \u2014 DO NOT add any commentary or explanation.\n6. This is a color analysis task. DO NOT make assumptions or subjective judgments.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of color composition. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video features a complex color usage that cannot be described as black-and-white, warm, cool, neutral, transitions among them, or warm\u2013cool contrasts.\n\n**Color Saturation:** The color saturation is too complex to be described as black-and-white, high, low, neutral, transitions among them, or strong contrast between saturated and desaturated areas.\n\n**Brightness and Exposure:** The brightness (or exposure) is too complex to be described as bright, neutral, dark, transitions among them, or strong contrast between bright and dark areas.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a rich and intricate color palette dominated by deep green hues, creating a visually engaging atmosphere. The color temperature is multifaceted, with a blend of tones that defy simple categorization into warm or cool, offering a unique visual experience. Saturation levels are complex, with a dynamic interplay of vivid and subtle shades that enhance the depth and texture of the scene. Brightness and exposure are equally intricate, with a nuanced balance that avoids stark contrasts, contributing to a cohesive and immersive visual narrative.",
