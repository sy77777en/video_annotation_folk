    "pre_caption": "The video features a predominantly dark scene with subtle lighting that creates a mysterious atmosphere. The color palette is neutral, with shadows dominating the space, allowing only hints of muted colors to emerge. The lighting is soft, casting gentle highlights on certain areas, which adds depth and dimension. The overall exposure is low, emphasizing silhouettes and creating a sense of intrigue. The balanced saturation ensures that no particular hue stands out, maintaining a cohesive and understated visual tone throughout.",
