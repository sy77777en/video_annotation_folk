    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their lighting setup. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the lighting setup in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a rural road leading to a bridge, surrounded by lush greenery and a vibrant blue sky filled with scattered, fluffy clouds. The focus is on the expansive environment, highlighting the open road, the natural elements, and the serene atmosphere. A distant red gate is visible, with some buildings behind it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor rural setting during the day, featuring a wide, dusty road leading to a bridge. The sky is bright with scattered clouds, casting soft shadows on the ground. On the left side of the frame, there is a cluster of lush green trees, and further left, a red gate with two buildings behind it. The bridge, made of concrete with metal railings, spans a dry riverbed. A traffic sign indicates a speed limit of 30, suggesting a structured environment. The overall atmosphere is calm and open, with natural and man-made elements harmoniously coexisting.**\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an outdoor environment..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The primary light source in the video is sunlight.\n\n**Sunlight Condition:** The video features bright, direct sunlight with strong intensity.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features hard lighting with strong, directional light.",
    "pre_caption": "The video showcases an outdoor rural setting with bright, direct sunlight as the primary light source. The sunlight is intense and creates hard lighting, casting well-defined shadows on the ground and surrounding elements. The scattered clouds in the sky occasionally diffuse the sunlight, softening the shadows momentarily. The lighting interacts with the environment by highlighting the textures of the dusty road and the lush greenery, while the concrete bridge and metal railings reflect the light, adding to the scene's brightness. The contrast ratio is high, with distinct light and shadow areas, emphasizing the depth and structure of the landscape. The light direction is predominantly top-down, consistent with the midday sun, enhancing the vividness of the natural colors and the serene atmosphere of the rural setting.",
