    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lens and optical effects, natural lighting effects, artificial/artistic lighting effects, volumetric lighting effects, shadow patterns, and dynamic lighting effects** in this video. Provide a concise yet informative description, focusing only on effects that are **clearly visible and a dominant feature of the scene**. Avoid speculative statements and ambiguous options. Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify any **lens and optical effects**, such as lens flares, chromatic aberration, bokeh, or vignetting, that influence the image\u2019s appearance. If present, describe their **intensity and placement** within the frame.  \n\nNext, describe **reflection effects**, specifying how light interacts with reflective surfaces such as water, glass, metal, or mirrors. Note whether reflections contribute to the composition, distort the image, or create layered visual depth.  \n\nFor **natural lighting effects**, mention any atmospheric or weather-related phenomena such as **sunbeams, rainbows, glows, or lightning**, emphasizing how they shape the scene\u2019s illumination.  \n\nIf the video features **artificial or artistic lighting effects**, describe any stylized or non-natural lighting setups, such as **neon glows, colored spotlights, or flickering lights**, that influence the mood or composition.  \n\nFor **volumetric lighting effects**, specify any visible light beams or light volumes caused by scattering through particles like **fog, smoke, dust, or mist**. Describe their **density, motion, and direction** if they significantly impact the scene.  \n\nIf distinct **shadow patterns or gobo lighting** are present, describe their shape, movement, or interaction with the environment. Examples include **sharp geometric shadows, tree branch silhouettes, or patterned projections** that add texture to the scene.  \n\nFinally, capture any **dynamic lighting effects**, noting whether the lighting **gradually or suddenly changes** in position, direction, color, brightness, or shape over time. If the lighting shifts due to **flickering, pulsing, or dimming**, describe its **timing and impact** on the visual composition.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture any special lighting effects. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the lighting effects in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a rural road leading to a bridge, surrounded by lush greenery and a vibrant blue sky filled with scattered, fluffy clouds. The focus is on the expansive environment, highlighting the open road, the natural elements, and the serene atmosphere. A distant red gate is visible, with some buildings behind it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor rural setting during the day, featuring a wide, dusty road leading to a bridge. The sky is bright with scattered clouds, casting soft shadows on the ground. On the left side of the frame, there is a cluster of lush green trees, and further left, a red gate with two buildings behind it. The bridge, made of concrete with metal railings, spans a dry riverbed. A traffic sign indicates a speed limit of 30, suggesting a structured environment. The overall atmosphere is calm and open, with natural and man-made elements harmoniously coexisting.**\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting effects.
