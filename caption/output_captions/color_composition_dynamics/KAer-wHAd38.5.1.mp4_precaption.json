    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the color composition and dynamics in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **color type, temperature, saturation, brightness, and grading**. Your goal is to describe the **overall color characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **color type** by stating whether the video is black-and-white or colored. If colored, describe the dominant colors of **major subjects and scene elements** such as clothing, sky, water, trees, buildings, and vehicles. Highlight any **salient or unusual colors** that enhance visual appeal.\n\nNext, describe the **overall color temperature** as **warm, cool, or neutral**. If the video contains both warm and cool elements, describe their contrast. If temperature changes throughout the video, specify the **initial and final states**.\n\nThen, describe the **color saturation**, indicating whether it is **high, neutral, or low**. Mention any **contrasting saturation elements**, such as a highly saturated neon sign in a desaturated environment. If saturation changes, specify how colors transition over time.\n\nSpecify the **overall brightness level** as **very bright, bright, neutral, dark, or very dark**. If different areas of the scene contrast in brightness, describe this relationship. If brightness changes, specify the **transition**.\n\nFinally, describe any **color grading effects** that influence the video\u2019s temperature, saturation, or brightness. If a distinct grading style is present, such as a **teal-and-orange filter** or **monochrome desaturation**, include it.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their color composition. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the color composition in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a rural road leading to a bridge, surrounded by lush greenery and a vibrant blue sky filled with scattered, fluffy clouds. The focus is on the expansive environment, highlighting the open road, the natural elements, and the serene atmosphere. A distant red gate is visible, with some buildings behind it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor rural setting during the day, featuring a wide, dusty road leading to a bridge. The sky is bright with scattered clouds, casting soft shadows on the ground. On the left side of the frame, there is a cluster of lush green trees, and further left, a red gate with two buildings behind it. The bridge, made of concrete with metal railings, spans a dry riverbed. A traffic sign indicates a speed limit of 30, suggesting a structured environment. The overall atmosphere is calm and open, with natural and man-made elements harmoniously coexisting.**\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of color composition. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Color Temperature:** The video's color palette is neutral, with neither warm nor cool tones being dominant.\n\n**Color Saturation:** The video has balanced color saturation, not dominated by overly vivid or grayish hues.\n\n**Brightness and Exposure:** The video is well-lit with strong lighting, making the scene bright and clear but not overexposed.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is colored, featuring a dominant palette of natural hues. The sky is a vibrant blue with scattered white clouds, while the surrounding greenery is lush and vivid. The road and bridge are neutral-toned, with the concrete appearing in shades of gray. A striking red gate adds a pop of color, contrasting with the natural elements. The overall color temperature is neutral, maintaining a balance between warm and cool tones. The saturation is balanced, with colors appearing natural and true to life, enhancing the serene and open atmosphere. The brightness is bright, with clear visibility and well-defined shadows, contributing to a crisp and lively scene. The color grading is naturalistic, emphasizing the harmony between the rural landscape and man-made structures without any dramatic filters or effects.",
