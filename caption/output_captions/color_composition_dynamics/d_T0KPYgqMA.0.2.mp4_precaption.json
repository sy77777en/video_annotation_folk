    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the color composition and dynamics in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **color type, temperature, saturation, brightness, and grading**. Your goal is to describe the **overall color characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **color type** by stating whether the video is black-and-white or colored. If colored, describe the dominant colors of **major subjects and scene elements** such as clothing, sky, water, trees, buildings, and vehicles. Highlight any **salient or unusual colors** that enhance visual appeal.\n\nNext, describe the **overall color temperature** as **warm, cool, or neutral**. If the video contains both warm and cool elements, describe their contrast. If temperature changes throughout the video, specify the **initial and final states**.\n\nThen, describe the **color saturation**, indicating whether it is **high, neutral, or low**. Mention any **contrasting saturation elements**, such as a highly saturated neon sign in a desaturated environment. If saturation changes, specify how colors transition over time.\n\nSpecify the **overall brightness level** as **very bright, bright, neutral, dark, or very dark**. If different areas of the scene contrast in brightness, describe this relationship. If brightness changes, specify the **transition**.\n\nFinally, describe any **color grading effects** that influence the video\u2019s temperature, saturation, or brightness. If a distinct grading style is present, such as a **teal-and-orange filter** or **monochrome desaturation**, include it.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their color composition. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the color composition in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman in a courtroom setting, wearing a traditional barrister's wig and black robe with white bands. She appears to be speaking, with a focused expression. In the background, there are several people seated, including a man in a suit and glasses, a woman with long hair, and another woman with blonde hair. The woman in the foreground is the primary subject, and her attire and position suggest she is addressing the court. The background figures are less distinct, serving as an audience to the proceedings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a courtroom, characterized by wooden paneling and a formal atmosphere. The time of day is indeterminate due to the controlled lighting typical of indoor settings. The scene features a legal professional in traditional attire, including a wig and robe, likely addressing the court. In the background, several people are seated, possibly jurors or observers, adding to the formal and serious environment. The setting emphasizes the solemnity and focus of the courtroom proceedings, with the legal professional's speech and people in the background introducing some movement and activity.**",
    "pre_caption": "The video is colored, with dominant hues of dark black and white in the barrister's attire, contrasting with the warm brown tones of the wooden paneling in the courtroom. The background features muted colors, with the audience's clothing in subdued shades, contributing to a formal and serious atmosphere. The overall color temperature is neutral, with a slight warmth from the wood tones, balanced by the coolness of the black and white attire. The color saturation is low, maintaining a professional and understated look, with no highly saturated elements to distract from the scene's focus. The brightness level is neutral, with even lighting that highlights the primary subject without casting harsh shadows or creating overly bright areas. The color grading is subtle, enhancing the natural tones of the setting and attire, with no distinct filters applied, maintaining the authenticity and gravity of the courtroom environment.",
