    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and movement** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial composition and motion** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on how much of the subject is visible. For example, *a close-up shot of a human face*, *a medium shot of a man\u2019s lower body*, or *a wide shot of a man standing near the ocean*. If the shot size does not follow a typical framing pattern or changes erratically, describe the overall framing instead, such as *\"The camera tracks a skateboarder in an unsteady manner, mostly capturing the skateboarder\u2019s lower body.\"*  \n\nNext, describe the **subject\u2019s position in the scene**. Indicate their approximate location within the frame, such as *\"The person is in the bottom-left corner of the frame\"* or *\"The person is on the right of the frame.\"* Describe their depth in the scene relative to the **foreground, midground, or background**, such as *\"In the foreground, a person is sitting in front of a computer.\"* Additionally, specify their physical placement within the environment, such as *\"The woman in the midground stands near a window, looking outside.\"*  \n\nFinally, describe the **subject\u2019s height relative to the camera**, if relevant. Indicate whether they are framed at eye level, above, or below the camera\u2019s perspective, such as *\"The man is framed at eye level.\"* or *\"A low-angle shot captures the person from below.\"*\n\nFor **scenery-focused shots without a primary subject**, describe how the scene is framed by detailing its **shot size** and **spatial composition**.  \n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** used to capture the environment, such as *a wide shot of a vast mountain range stretching across the horizon* or *a close-up of raindrops hitting a window*.  \n\nNext, describe the **spatial composition**, including the positioning of key elements within the frame. Indicate where objects appear, such as *a symmetrical shot of a hallway positioned at the center, leading toward a vanishing point* or *a large tree stands in the left-bottom corner*. Incorporate depth by mentioning **foreground, midground, and background** elements when relevant. For instance, *in the foreground, a bicycle is parked against a fence, while in the background, skyscrapers rise against the sky* or *the midground features a river cutting through the landscape*.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes within the frame, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.  \n\nFor **subjects**, indicate how their position and framing evolve. For example, *\"A medium shot of a man\u2019s upper body near a doorway transitions into a close-up of his face as he walks toward the camera.\"* Similarly, describe movement across the frame, such as *\"A cyclist moves from the left to the right side of the frame, maintaining a full shot throughout.\"* If the camera\u2019s perspective changes, specify the shift, like *\"A full-body shot of a child at eye level shifts as the camera tilts upward, reframing them from a low angle looking up.\"*  \n\nFor **scenery shots**, describe how the framing adjusts to reveal different aspects of the environment. For instance, *\"The shot begins with an aerial view of a city skyline, then tilts downward to focus on a busy intersection.\"* If the camera moves through space, specify the transition, such as *\"The camera moves forward, transitioning from a wide view of a dense forest to a close-up of a single tree trunk covered in moss.\"*\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a subway station, capturing the scene at the subjects' level. In the foreground, a person stands near the turnstiles on the left side of the frame, positioned close to the entrance labeled \"Red Line trains.\" The midground features multiple turnstiles stretching across the frame, leading deeper into the station. The background reveals the station's interior, with tiled walls and overhead lighting. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward, maintaining the wide shot while focusing more closely on the turnstiles, reducing the visible space around them. The overall composition emphasizes the station's structured layout and the movement toward the entrance.",
