    "pre_caption": "The video showcases a futuristic cityscape at night, illuminated by vibrant, artificial lighting. Bright, colorful lights from various sources, including neon signs and billboards, dominate the scene, creating a vivid and dynamic atmosphere. These lights cast a glow across the buildings, enhancing the urban landscape's modern aesthetic. The artificial lighting effects are prominent, contributing significantly to the overall ambiance and mood of the scene.\n\nIn addition to the artificial lighting, there is a noticeable presence of volumetric lighting effects. Intense light beams, appearing as cone-shaped volumes, pass through what seems to be smoke, fog, or a similar atmospheric medium. These light volumes are dense and directional, adding depth and a sense of movement to the scene. They create a dramatic interplay of light and shadow, contributing to the cinematic quality of the video.\n\nThe dynamic lighting effects are also evident, with the light sources traversing the scene and changing direction. This movement creates a lively and engaging visual experience, as the light dynamics shift and evolve throughout the sequence. The interplay between the static cityscape and the moving light sources adds a layer of complexity and visual interest to the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lens and optical effects, natural lighting effects, artificial/artistic lighting effects, volumetric lighting effects, shadow patterns, and dynamic lighting effects** in this video. Provide a concise yet informative description, focusing only on effects that are **clearly visible and a dominant feature of the scene**. Avoid speculative statements and ambiguous options. Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify any **lens and optical effects**, such as lens flares, chromatic aberration, bokeh, or vignetting, that influence the image\u2019s appearance. If present, describe their **intensity and placement** within the frame.  \n\nNext, describe **reflection effects**, specifying how light interacts with reflective surfaces such as water, glass, metal, or mirrors. Note whether reflections contribute to the composition, distort the image, or create layered visual depth.  \n\nFor **natural lighting effects**, mention any atmospheric or weather-related phenomena such as **sunbeams, rainbows, glows, or lightning**, emphasizing how they shape the scene\u2019s illumination.  \n\nIf the video features **artificial or artistic lighting effects**, describe any stylized or non-natural lighting setups, such as **neon glows, colored spotlights, or flickering lights**, that influence the mood or composition.  \n\nFor **volumetric lighting effects**, specify any visible light beams or light volumes caused by scattering through particles like **fog, smoke, dust, or mist**. Describe their **density, motion, and direction** if they significantly impact the scene.  \n\nIf distinct **shadow patterns or gobo lighting** are present, describe their shape, movement, or interaction with the environment. Examples include **sharp geometric shadows, tree branch silhouettes, or patterned projections** that add texture to the scene.  \n\nFinally, capture any **dynamic lighting effects**, noting whether the lighting **gradually or suddenly changes** in position, direction, color, brightness, or shape over time. If the lighting shifts due to **flickering, pulsing, or dimming**, describe its **timing and impact** on the visual composition.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting effects. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Lens and Optical Effects:** No significant lens or optical effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Light Reflections:** No significant light reflections in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Natural Lighting Effects:** No significant natural lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Artificial or Artistic Lighting Effects:** The video features artificial colored or neon lighting. The video features bright, colorful city lighting from various artificial sources. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Volumetric Lighting:** The video features concentrated, cone-shaped volumes of light. The video features intense light passing through smoke, fog, or liquid, shaping visible light volumes. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Shadow Patterns or Gobo Lighting Effects:** No distinct or noteworthy shadow patterns or Gobo lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lighting Dynamics:** The video features major light source(s) that traverse the scene or change direction. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Other Dynamics: The video shows objects or characters floating or levitating as if unaffected by gravity. (please include and explain these effects.)",
