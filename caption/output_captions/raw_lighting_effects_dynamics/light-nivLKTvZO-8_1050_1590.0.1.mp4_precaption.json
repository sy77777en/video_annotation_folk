    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lens and optical effects, natural lighting effects, artificial/artistic lighting effects, volumetric lighting effects, shadow patterns, and dynamic lighting effects** in this video. Provide a concise yet informative description, focusing only on effects that are **clearly visible and a dominant feature of the scene**. Avoid speculative statements and ambiguous options. Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify any **lens and optical effects**, such as lens flares, chromatic aberration, bokeh, or vignetting, that influence the image\u2019s appearance. If present, describe their **intensity and placement** within the frame.  \n\nNext, describe **reflection effects**, specifying how light interacts with reflective surfaces such as water, glass, metal, or mirrors. Note whether reflections contribute to the composition, distort the image, or create layered visual depth.  \n\nFor **natural lighting effects**, mention any atmospheric or weather-related phenomena such as **sunbeams, rainbows, glows, or lightning**, emphasizing how they shape the scene\u2019s illumination.  \n\nIf the video features **artificial or artistic lighting effects**, describe any stylized or non-natural lighting setups, such as **neon glows, colored spotlights, or flickering lights**, that influence the mood or composition.  \n\nFor **volumetric lighting effects**, specify any visible light beams or light volumes caused by scattering through particles like **fog, smoke, dust, or mist**. Describe their **density, motion, and direction** if they significantly impact the scene.  \n\nIf distinct **shadow patterns or gobo lighting** are present, describe their shape, movement, or interaction with the environment. Examples include **sharp geometric shadows, tree branch silhouettes, or patterned projections** that add texture to the scene.  \n\nFinally, capture any **dynamic lighting effects**, noting whether the lighting **gradually or suddenly changes** in position, direction, color, brightness, or shape over time. If the lighting shifts due to **flickering, pulsing, or dimming**, describe its **timing and impact** on the visual composition.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting effects. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Lens and Optical Effects:** The video contains obvious lens flares. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Light Reflections:** No significant light reflections in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Natural Lighting Effects:** No significant natural lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Artificial or Artistic Lighting Effects:** The video features artificial colored or neon lighting. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Volumetric Lighting:** The video features concentrated, cone-shaped volumes of light. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Shadow Patterns or Gobo Lighting Effects:** No distinct or noteworthy shadow patterns or Gobo lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lighting Dynamics:** The lighting color in the video changes abruptly and rapidly (a sudden color shift). The lighting in the video flashes, creating sudden bursts of light in an on/off pattern. The video features major light source(s) that traverse the scene or change direction. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Other Dynamics: No other significant dynamics in this video. (no need to mention).",
    "pre_caption": "The video showcases a series of intense, dynamic lighting effects. Lens flares are prominent, particularly noticeable during moments when the camera focuses directly on the light sources, creating bright, overexposed areas that dominate the frame. These flares vary in intensity, with some frames showing more pronounced flare effects than others, suggesting variations in the angle of the camera relative to the light sources.\n\nArtificial or artistic lighting effects are evident throughout the sequence. The scene is illuminated by multiple spotlights arranged in a grid-like pattern, emitting bright, focused beams of light. The colors of the light range from warm orange to white, creating a vivid contrast against the dark background. The lights flicker and pulse, producing a rhythmic, almost hypnotic effect. The light sources themselves are not visible, but their beams are clearly defined, moving across the frame and changing direction, contributing to the dynamic nature of the scene.\n\nVolumetric lighting effects are also present, with the light beams appearing as concentrated, cone-shaped volumes that spread out as they travel. These beams interact with the surrounding space, creating a sense of depth and movement. The density of the light varies, with some beams appearing thicker and more intense than others, adding to the visual complexity.\n\nOverall, the video's lighting dynamics are",
