    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lens and optical effects, natural lighting effects, artificial/artistic lighting effects, volumetric lighting effects, shadow patterns, and dynamic lighting effects** in this video. Provide a concise yet informative description, focusing only on effects that are **clearly visible and a dominant feature of the scene**. Avoid speculative statements and ambiguous options. Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify any **lens and optical effects**, such as lens flares, chromatic aberration, bokeh, or vignetting, that influence the image\u2019s appearance. If present, describe their **intensity and placement** within the frame.  \n\nNext, describe **reflection effects**, specifying how light interacts with reflective surfaces such as water, glass, metal, or mirrors. Note whether reflections contribute to the composition, distort the image, or create layered visual depth.  \n\nFor **natural lighting effects**, mention any atmospheric or weather-related phenomena such as **sunbeams, rainbows, glows, or lightning**, emphasizing how they shape the scene\u2019s illumination.  \n\nIf the video features **artificial or artistic lighting effects**, describe any stylized or non-natural lighting setups, such as **neon glows, colored spotlights, or flickering lights**, that influence the mood or composition.  \n\nFor **volumetric lighting effects**, specify any visible light beams or light volumes caused by scattering through particles like **fog, smoke, dust, or mist**. Describe their **density, motion, and direction** if they significantly impact the scene.  \n\nIf distinct **shadow patterns or gobo lighting** are present, describe their shape, movement, or interaction with the environment. Examples include **sharp geometric shadows, tree branch silhouettes, or patterned projections** that add texture to the scene.  \n\nFinally, capture any **dynamic lighting effects**, noting whether the lighting **gradually or suddenly changes** in position, direction, color, brightness, or shape over time. If the lighting shifts due to **flickering, pulsing, or dimming**, describe its **timing and impact** on the visual composition.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting effects. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Lens and Optical Effects:** No significant lens or optical effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Light Reflections:** No significant light reflections in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Natural Lighting Effects:** No significant natural lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Artificial or Artistic Lighting Effects:** The video features water caustics, where refracted and reflected light creates dynamic, rippling patterns. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Volumetric Lighting:** The video features striking, separated (god) rays of light streaming through gaps in the environment. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Shadow Patterns or Gobo Lighting Effects:** No distinct or noteworthy shadow patterns or Gobo lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lighting Dynamics:** No significant lighting dynamics in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Other Dynamics: The video contains a revealing shot that gradually uncovers a new environment or subject. The video shows objects or characters floating or levitating as if unaffected by gravity. (please include and explain these effects.)",
    "pre_caption": "The video showcases a dark, eerie environment illuminated by dynamic, separated light beams, often referred to as \"god rays.\" These beams of light stream through gaps in the surroundings, creating a dramatic interplay of light and shadow. The light appears to be refracted and scattered through particles in the air, giving the impression of a misty or foggy atmosphere. The beams vary in intensity and direction, adding a sense of mystery and tension to the scene. The overall effect is one of a mysterious, possibly supernatural setting, enhanced by the subtle, shifting patterns of light.",
