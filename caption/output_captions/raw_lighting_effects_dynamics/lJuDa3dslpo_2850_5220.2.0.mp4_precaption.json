    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lens and optical effects, natural lighting effects, artificial/artistic lighting effects, volumetric lighting effects, shadow patterns, and dynamic lighting effects** in this video. Provide a concise yet informative description, focusing only on effects that are **clearly visible and a dominant feature of the scene**. Avoid speculative statements and ambiguous options. Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify any **lens and optical effects**, such as lens flares, chromatic aberration, bokeh, or vignetting, that influence the image\u2019s appearance. If present, describe their **intensity and placement** within the frame.  \n\nNext, describe **reflection effects**, specifying how light interacts with reflective surfaces such as water, glass, metal, or mirrors. Note whether reflections contribute to the composition, distort the image, or create layered visual depth.  \n\nFor **natural lighting effects**, mention any atmospheric or weather-related phenomena such as **sunbeams, rainbows, glows, or lightning**, emphasizing how they shape the scene\u2019s illumination.  \n\nIf the video features **artificial or artistic lighting effects**, describe any stylized or non-natural lighting setups, such as **neon glows, colored spotlights, or flickering lights**, that influence the mood or composition.  \n\nFor **volumetric lighting effects**, specify any visible light beams or light volumes caused by scattering through particles like **fog, smoke, dust, or mist**. Describe their **density, motion, and direction** if they significantly impact the scene.  \n\nIf distinct **shadow patterns or gobo lighting** are present, describe their shape, movement, or interaction with the environment. Examples include **sharp geometric shadows, tree branch silhouettes, or patterned projections** that add texture to the scene.  \n\nFinally, capture any **dynamic lighting effects**, noting whether the lighting **gradually or suddenly changes** in position, direction, color, brightness, or shape over time. If the lighting shifts due to **flickering, pulsing, or dimming**, describe its **timing and impact** on the visual composition.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting effects. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Lens and Optical Effects:** No significant lens or optical effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Light Reflections:** The video features a noticeable specular reflection from light bouncing off a smooth, glossy surface but does not clearly mirror the scene in detail. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Natural Lighting Effects:** No significant natural lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Artificial or Artistic Lighting Effects:** The video features artificial colored or neon lighting. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Volumetric Lighting:** The video features concentrated, cone-shaped volumes of light. The video features intense light passing through smoke, fog, or liquid, shaping visible light volumes. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Shadow Patterns or Gobo Lighting Effects:** The video features distinct or dynamic shadow patterns or gobo lighting effects other than Venetian blinds, window frames, foliage, or the subject's shape. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Lighting Dynamics:** The video features major light source(s) that traverse the scene or change direction. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Other Dynamics: No other significant dynamics in this video. (no need to mention).",
    "pre_caption": "The video showcases a dynamic stage performance set against a lush, forest-like backdrop. The stage is illuminated by an array of artificial lighting effects, primarily featuring vibrant blue and green hues that create a mystical and otherworldly atmosphere. These lights are strategically placed to highlight the performers and enhance the overall ambiance of the scene.\n\nReflections are prominent, with light bouncing off a glossy, reflective surface that covers the stage floor, creating shimmering patterns that add depth and visual interest. The reflections are not perfectly mirrored but contribute to the dynamic interplay of light and shadow, enhancing the sense of movement and energy on stage.\n\nVolumetric lighting effects are evident, with concentrated, cone-shaped beams of light passing through what appears to be smoke or fog, creating visible light volumes that move across the stage. These beams are dense and directional, adding a dramatic and ethereal quality to the performance.\n\nNo significant natural lighting effects are present, as the scene is entirely lit by artificial sources. The absence of natural light allows for greater control over the mood and atmosphere, which is achieved through the use of colored spotlights and neon glows.\n\nShadow patterns are minimal, as the lighting is designed to be bright and evenly distributed, minimizing harsh shadows. However, subtle variations in light intensity create soft gradients that",
