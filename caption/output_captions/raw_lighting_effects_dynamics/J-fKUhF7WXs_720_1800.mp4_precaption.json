    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lens and optical effects, natural lighting effects, artificial/artistic lighting effects, volumetric lighting effects, shadow patterns, and dynamic lighting effects** in this video. Provide a concise yet informative description, focusing only on effects that are **clearly visible and a dominant feature of the scene**. Avoid speculative statements and ambiguous options. Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify any **lens and optical effects**, such as lens flares, chromatic aberration, bokeh, or vignetting, that influence the image\u2019s appearance. If present, describe their **intensity and placement** within the frame.  \n\nNext, describe **reflection effects**, specifying how light interacts with reflective surfaces such as water, glass, metal, or mirrors. Note whether reflections contribute to the composition, distort the image, or create layered visual depth.  \n\nFor **natural lighting effects**, mention any atmospheric or weather-related phenomena such as **sunbeams, rainbows, glows, or lightning**, emphasizing how they shape the scene\u2019s illumination.  \n\nIf the video features **artificial or artistic lighting effects**, describe any stylized or non-natural lighting setups, such as **neon glows, colored spotlights, or flickering lights**, that influence the mood or composition.  \n\nFor **volumetric lighting effects**, specify any visible light beams or light volumes caused by scattering through particles like **fog, smoke, dust, or mist**. Describe their **density, motion, and direction** if they significantly impact the scene.  \n\nIf distinct **shadow patterns or gobo lighting** are present, describe their shape, movement, or interaction with the environment. Examples include **sharp geometric shadows, tree branch silhouettes, or patterned projections** that add texture to the scene.  \n\nFinally, capture any **dynamic lighting effects**, noting whether the lighting **gradually or suddenly changes** in position, direction, color, brightness, or shape over time. If the lighting shifts due to **flickering, pulsing, or dimming**, describe its **timing and impact** on the visual composition.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting effects. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Lens and Optical Effects:** No significant lens or optical effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Light Reflections:** No significant light reflections in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Natural Lighting Effects:** No significant natural lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Artificial or Artistic Lighting Effects:** The video features artificial colored or neon lighting. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Volumetric Lighting:** No significant volumetric lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Shadow Patterns or Gobo Lighting Effects:** No distinct or noteworthy shadow patterns or Gobo lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lighting Dynamics:** The lighting in the video flashes, creating sudden bursts of light in an on/off pattern. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Other Dynamics: No other significant dynamics in this video. (no need to mention).",
    "pre_caption": "The video showcases a group of dancers performing against a backdrop of blue curtains. The primary focus is on the dancers' movements, which are illuminated by a consistent blue light that creates a striking silhouette effect. This lighting is artificial and artistic, designed to enhance the visual impact of the dancers' fluid and energetic choreography. The dancers move in unison, executing synchronized steps and gestures that are accentuated by the stark contrast between their dark figures and the bright blue background. The lighting remains steady throughout, maintaining a strong emphasis on the dancers' forms and movements without introducing any dynamic changes or additional effects.",
