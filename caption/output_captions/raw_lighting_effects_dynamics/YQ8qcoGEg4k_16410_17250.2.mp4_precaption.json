    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lens and optical effects, natural lighting effects, artificial/artistic lighting effects, volumetric lighting effects, shadow patterns, and dynamic lighting effects** in this video. Provide a concise yet informative description, focusing only on effects that are **clearly visible and a dominant feature of the scene**. Avoid speculative statements and ambiguous options. Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify any **lens and optical effects**, such as lens flares, chromatic aberration, bokeh, or vignetting, that influence the image\u2019s appearance. If present, describe their **intensity and placement** within the frame.  \n\nNext, describe **reflection effects**, specifying how light interacts with reflective surfaces such as water, glass, metal, or mirrors. Note whether reflections contribute to the composition, distort the image, or create layered visual depth.  \n\nFor **natural lighting effects**, mention any atmospheric or weather-related phenomena such as **sunbeams, rainbows, glows, or lightning**, emphasizing how they shape the scene\u2019s illumination.  \n\nIf the video features **artificial or artistic lighting effects**, describe any stylized or non-natural lighting setups, such as **neon glows, colored spotlights, or flickering lights**, that influence the mood or composition.  \n\nFor **volumetric lighting effects**, specify any visible light beams or light volumes caused by scattering through particles like **fog, smoke, dust, or mist**. Describe their **density, motion, and direction** if they significantly impact the scene.  \n\nIf distinct **shadow patterns or gobo lighting** are present, describe their shape, movement, or interaction with the environment. Examples include **sharp geometric shadows, tree branch silhouettes, or patterned projections** that add texture to the scene.  \n\nFinally, capture any **dynamic lighting effects**, noting whether the lighting **gradually or suddenly changes** in position, direction, color, brightness, or shape over time. If the lighting shifts due to **flickering, pulsing, or dimming**, describe its **timing and impact** on the visual composition.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting effects. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Lens and Optical Effects:** The video contains obvious lens flares. The video contains anamorphic lens flares as bright, elongated streaks from light interacting with an anamorphic lens. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Light Reflections:** No significant light reflections in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Natural Lighting Effects:** No significant natural lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Artificial or Artistic Lighting Effects:** The video features artificial colored or neon lighting. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Volumetric Lighting:** The video features visible beams of light with well-defined edges, creating linear volumes of light. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Shadow Patterns or Gobo Lighting Effects:** No distinct or noteworthy shadow patterns or Gobo lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lighting Dynamics:** The video features major light source(s) that traverse the scene or change direction. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Other Dynamics: The video showcases an explosion with a sudden burst of flames, matter, and outward force. (please include and explain these effects.)",
    "pre_caption": "The video showcases a dynamic and intense action sequence featuring a character engaged in combat amidst a visually striking environment. Lens flares are prominent, appearing as bright, elongated streaks from light interacting with an anamorphic lens, particularly noticeable during explosions and fast-moving scenes. These flares vary in intensity and placement, adding a sense of energy and chaos to the visuals.\n\nArtificial or artistic lighting effects are evident throughout the sequence, with vibrant red laser beams crisscrossing the sky, creating a grid-like pattern that enhances the futuristic and high-tech atmosphere. These beams are static but serve as a constant backdrop, contributing to the overall tension and action.\n\nVolumetric lighting effects are also a key feature, with beams of light that appear to emanate from the ground and ascend into the sky. These beams are well-defined and have sharp edges, forming linear volumes of light that move dynamically across the scene. They suggest the presence of powerful energy sources or weapons, adding to the dramatic and intense nature of the battle.\n\nThe explosions in the video are particularly impactful, with sudden bursts of flames and matter that radiate outward, creating a sense of explosive force and destruction. These effects are accompanied by dynamic lighting dynamics, where the light sources shift and change in response to the explosions,",
