    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lens and optical effects, natural lighting effects, artificial/artistic lighting effects, volumetric lighting effects, shadow patterns, and dynamic lighting effects** in this video. Provide a concise yet informative description, focusing only on effects that are **clearly visible and a dominant feature of the scene**. Avoid speculative statements and ambiguous options. Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify any **lens and optical effects**, such as lens flares, chromatic aberration, bokeh, or vignetting, that influence the image\u2019s appearance. If present, describe their **intensity and placement** within the frame.  \n\nNext, describe **reflection effects**, specifying how light interacts with reflective surfaces such as water, glass, metal, or mirrors. Note whether reflections contribute to the composition, distort the image, or create layered visual depth.  \n\nFor **natural lighting effects**, mention any atmospheric or weather-related phenomena such as **sunbeams, rainbows, glows, or lightning**, emphasizing how they shape the scene\u2019s illumination.  \n\nIf the video features **artificial or artistic lighting effects**, describe any stylized or non-natural lighting setups, such as **neon glows, colored spotlights, or flickering lights**, that influence the mood or composition.  \n\nFor **volumetric lighting effects**, specify any visible light beams or light volumes caused by scattering through particles like **fog, smoke, dust, or mist**. Describe their **density, motion, and direction** if they significantly impact the scene.  \n\nIf distinct **shadow patterns or gobo lighting** are present, describe their shape, movement, or interaction with the environment. Examples include **sharp geometric shadows, tree branch silhouettes, or patterned projections** that add texture to the scene.  \n\nFinally, capture any **dynamic lighting effects**, noting whether the lighting **gradually or suddenly changes** in position, direction, color, brightness, or shape over time. If the lighting shifts due to **flickering, pulsing, or dimming**, describe its **timing and impact** on the visual composition.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting effects. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Lens and Optical Effects:** No significant lens or optical effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Light Reflections:** No significant light reflections in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Natural Lighting Effects:** The video captures a lightning effect with intense flashes and jagged, branching streaks. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Artificial or Artistic Lighting Effects:** The video features light from street lamps. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Volumetric Lighting:** No significant volumetric lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Shadow Patterns or Gobo Lighting Effects:** No distinct or noteworthy shadow patterns or Gobo lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lighting Dynamics:** No significant lighting dynamics in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Other Dynamics: No other significant dynamics in this video. (no need to mention).",
    "pre_caption": "The video showcases a dramatic nighttime scene featuring a large Tesla coil generating intense electrical discharges. The primary focus is on the coil itself, which emits bright, jagged lightning bolts that arc outward in various directions. These bolts are vivid and striking against the dark sky, creating a visually captivating display. The artificial lighting from the Tesla coil dominates the scene, providing a stark contrast to the ambient street lamps visible in the background. The overall effect is one of dynamic energy and power, with the lightning bolts serving as the central and most prominent light source in the video.",
