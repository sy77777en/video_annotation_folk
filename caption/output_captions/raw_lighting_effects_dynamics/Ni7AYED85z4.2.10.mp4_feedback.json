    "pre_caption": "The video captures a serene waterfront scene in Venice, Italy, under overcast skies. The wet cobblestone pavement reflects the muted light, creating a shimmering effect that enhances the tranquil atmosphere. The water's surface also reflects the surrounding architecture and the figures walking along the promenade, adding layers of visual depth. The interplay of light and reflection contributes to the overall calm and slightly melancholic mood of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lens and optical effects, natural lighting effects, artificial/artistic lighting effects, volumetric lighting effects, shadow patterns, and dynamic lighting effects** in this video. Provide a concise yet informative description, focusing only on effects that are **clearly visible and a dominant feature of the scene**. Avoid speculative statements and ambiguous options. Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify any **lens and optical effects**, such as lens flares, chromatic aberration, bokeh, or vignetting, that influence the image\u2019s appearance. If present, describe their **intensity and placement** within the frame.  \n\nNext, describe **reflection effects**, specifying how light interacts with reflective surfaces such as water, glass, metal, or mirrors. Note whether reflections contribute to the composition, distort the image, or create layered visual depth.  \n\nFor **natural lighting effects**, mention any atmospheric or weather-related phenomena such as **sunbeams, rainbows, glows, or lightning**, emphasizing how they shape the scene\u2019s illumination.  \n\nIf the video features **artificial or artistic lighting effects**, describe any stylized or non-natural lighting setups, such as **neon glows, colored spotlights, or flickering lights**, that influence the mood or composition.  \n\nFor **volumetric lighting effects**, specify any visible light beams or light volumes caused by scattering through particles like **fog, smoke, dust, or mist**. Describe their **density, motion, and direction** if they significantly impact the scene.  \n\nIf distinct **shadow patterns or gobo lighting** are present, describe their shape, movement, or interaction with the environment. Examples include **sharp geometric shadows, tree branch silhouettes, or patterned projections** that add texture to the scene.  \n\nFinally, capture any **dynamic lighting effects**, noting whether the lighting **gradually or suddenly changes** in position, direction, color, brightness, or shape over time. If the lighting shifts due to **flickering, pulsing, or dimming**, describe its **timing and impact** on the visual composition.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting effects. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Lens and Optical Effects:** No significant lens or optical effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Light Reflections:** The video shows noticeable shimmering effects or bright highlights from light reflecting off water. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Natural Lighting Effects:** No significant natural lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Artificial or Artistic Lighting Effects:** No significant artificial or artistic lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Volumetric Lighting:** No significant volumetric lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Shadow Patterns or Gobo Lighting Effects:** No distinct or noteworthy shadow patterns or Gobo lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lighting Dynamics:** No significant lighting dynamics in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Other Dynamics: The video features visible splashing or wave-like motion in water or other liquids. (please include and explain these effects.)",
