    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lens and optical effects, natural lighting effects, artificial/artistic lighting effects, volumetric lighting effects, shadow patterns, and dynamic lighting effects** in this video. Provide a concise yet informative description, focusing only on effects that are **clearly visible and a dominant feature of the scene**. Avoid speculative statements and ambiguous options. Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify any **lens and optical effects**, such as lens flares, chromatic aberration, bokeh, or vignetting, that influence the image\u2019s appearance. If present, describe their **intensity and placement** within the frame.  \n\nNext, describe **reflection effects**, specifying how light interacts with reflective surfaces such as water, glass, metal, or mirrors. Note whether reflections contribute to the composition, distort the image, or create layered visual depth.  \n\nFor **natural lighting effects**, mention any atmospheric or weather-related phenomena such as **sunbeams, rainbows, glows, or lightning**, emphasizing how they shape the scene\u2019s illumination.  \n\nIf the video features **artificial or artistic lighting effects**, describe any stylized or non-natural lighting setups, such as **neon glows, colored spotlights, or flickering lights**, that influence the mood or composition.  \n\nFor **volumetric lighting effects**, specify any visible light beams or light volumes caused by scattering through particles like **fog, smoke, dust, or mist**. Describe their **density, motion, and direction** if they significantly impact the scene.  \n\nIf distinct **shadow patterns or gobo lighting** are present, describe their shape, movement, or interaction with the environment. Examples include **sharp geometric shadows, tree branch silhouettes, or patterned projections** that add texture to the scene.  \n\nFinally, capture any **dynamic lighting effects**, noting whether the lighting **gradually or suddenly changes** in position, direction, color, brightness, or shape over time. If the lighting shifts due to **flickering, pulsing, or dimming**, describe its **timing and impact** on the visual composition.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting effects. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Lens and Optical Effects:** No significant lens or optical effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Light Reflections:** No significant light reflections in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Natural Lighting Effects:** No significant natural lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Artificial or Artistic Lighting Effects:** The video features artificial colored or neon lighting. The video features bright, colorful city lighting from various artificial sources. The video features light from street lamps. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Volumetric Lighting:** The video features volumetric lighting with a well-defined, contained shape (other than beams, god rays, or spotlights). (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Shadow Patterns or Gobo Lighting Effects:** No distinct or noteworthy shadow patterns or Gobo lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lighting Dynamics:** The lighting color in the video changes gradually and smoothly (a smooth color shift). The video features lighting that varies in brightness, either through rhythmic pulsing or irregular flickering. The video features major light source(s) that traverse the scene or change direction. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Other Dynamics: The video contains a revealing shot that gradually uncovers a new environment or subject. (please include and explain these effects.)",
    "pre_caption": "The video showcases vibrant, artificial lighting effects typical of a bustling urban night scene. Bright, colorful lights from street lamps and other artificial sources illuminate the streets, creating a lively and dynamic atmosphere. The lighting is predominantly neon and fluorescent, casting a spectrum of colors across the scene, including greens, purples, blues, and yellows. These lights flicker and pulse, contributing to an energetic and somewhat chaotic visual experience. The camera pans across the scene, revealing the interplay between the lights and the surrounding architecture, which includes illuminated signs and buildings. The overall effect is one of a vibrant, almost surreal urban environment, where the artificial lighting dominates the visual field. There are no significant natural lighting effects, and the volumetric lighting appears to be contained within the confines of the cityscape, adding depth and dimension to the scene. The dynamic lighting dynamics are characterized by smooth color shifts and variations in brightness, enhancing the sense of movement and activity within the video.",
