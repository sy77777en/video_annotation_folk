    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lens and optical effects, natural lighting effects, artificial/artistic lighting effects, volumetric lighting effects, shadow patterns, and dynamic lighting effects** in this video. Provide a concise yet informative description, focusing only on effects that are **clearly visible and a dominant feature of the scene**. Avoid speculative statements and ambiguous options. Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify any **lens and optical effects**, such as lens flares, chromatic aberration, bokeh, or vignetting, that influence the image\u2019s appearance. If present, describe their **intensity and placement** within the frame.  \n\nNext, describe **reflection effects**, specifying how light interacts with reflective surfaces such as water, glass, metal, or mirrors. Note whether reflections contribute to the composition, distort the image, or create layered visual depth.  \n\nFor **natural lighting effects**, mention any atmospheric or weather-related phenomena such as **sunbeams, rainbows, glows, or lightning**, emphasizing how they shape the scene\u2019s illumination.  \n\nIf the video features **artificial or artistic lighting effects**, describe any stylized or non-natural lighting setups, such as **neon glows, colored spotlights, or flickering lights**, that influence the mood or composition.  \n\nFor **volumetric lighting effects**, specify any visible light beams or light volumes caused by scattering through particles like **fog, smoke, dust, or mist**. Describe their **density, motion, and direction** if they significantly impact the scene.  \n\nIf distinct **shadow patterns or gobo lighting** are present, describe their shape, movement, or interaction with the environment. Examples include **sharp geometric shadows, tree branch silhouettes, or patterned projections** that add texture to the scene.  \n\nFinally, capture any **dynamic lighting effects**, noting whether the lighting **gradually or suddenly changes** in position, direction, color, brightness, or shape over time. If the lighting shifts due to **flickering, pulsing, or dimming**, describe its **timing and impact** on the visual composition.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting effects. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Lens and Optical Effects:** No significant lens or optical effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Light Reflections:** No significant light reflections in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Natural Lighting Effects:** The video captures a lightning effect with intense flashes and jagged, branching streaks. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Artificial or Artistic Lighting Effects:** No significant artificial or artistic lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Volumetric Lighting:** The video features concentrated, cone-shaped volumes of light. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Shadow Patterns or Gobo Lighting Effects:** No distinct or noteworthy shadow patterns or Gobo lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lighting Dynamics:** The video features lighting that varies in brightness, either through rhythmic pulsing or irregular flickering. The lighting in the video flashes, creating sudden bursts of light in an on/off pattern. The video features major light source(s) that traverse the scene or change direction. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Other Dynamics: The video shows objects or characters floating or levitating as if unaffected by gravity. (please include and explain these effects.)",
    "pre_caption": "The video showcases a dramatic nighttime scene illuminated by a UFO hovering overhead, emitting a bright, focused beam of light. The artificial light from the UFO creates sharp, defined shadows and casts a stark contrast against the dark surroundings. The beam of light from the UFO is particularly striking, forming a cone-shaped volume of light that illuminates the ground below, highlighting the cows and the surrounding landscape. This volumetric lighting effect adds a sense of mystery and tension to the scene.\n\nThe lighting dynamics are characterized by sudden bursts of light, with the UFO's beam flickering and pulsing, creating an eerie and unsettling atmosphere. The intensity of the light fluctuates, sometimes intensifying to reveal more details of the cows and other times dimming, obscuring them in darkness. This rhythmic change in brightness contributes to the overall suspenseful mood of the video.\n\nThe cows appear to be reacting to the light, moving around and seemingly startled by the UFO's presence. Their movements are captured in a way that emphasizes the dynamic interplay between the artificial light and the natural elements of the scene. The cows' shadows shift and elongate as the light changes, adding to the visual complexity and enhancing the sense of unease.\n\nOverall, the video employs a combination of artificial lighting and dynamic light effects to",
