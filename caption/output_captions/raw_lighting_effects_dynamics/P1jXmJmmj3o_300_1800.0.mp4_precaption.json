    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lens and optical effects, natural lighting effects, artificial/artistic lighting effects, volumetric lighting effects, shadow patterns, and dynamic lighting effects** in this video. Provide a concise yet informative description, focusing only on effects that are **clearly visible and a dominant feature of the scene**. Avoid speculative statements and ambiguous options. Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify any **lens and optical effects**, such as lens flares, chromatic aberration, bokeh, or vignetting, that influence the image\u2019s appearance. If present, describe their **intensity and placement** within the frame.  \n\nNext, describe **reflection effects**, specifying how light interacts with reflective surfaces such as water, glass, metal, or mirrors. Note whether reflections contribute to the composition, distort the image, or create layered visual depth.  \n\nFor **natural lighting effects**, mention any atmospheric or weather-related phenomena such as **sunbeams, rainbows, glows, or lightning**, emphasizing how they shape the scene\u2019s illumination.  \n\nIf the video features **artificial or artistic lighting effects**, describe any stylized or non-natural lighting setups, such as **neon glows, colored spotlights, or flickering lights**, that influence the mood or composition.  \n\nFor **volumetric lighting effects**, specify any visible light beams or light volumes caused by scattering through particles like **fog, smoke, dust, or mist**. Describe their **density, motion, and direction** if they significantly impact the scene.  \n\nIf distinct **shadow patterns or gobo lighting** are present, describe their shape, movement, or interaction with the environment. Examples include **sharp geometric shadows, tree branch silhouettes, or patterned projections** that add texture to the scene.  \n\nFinally, capture any **dynamic lighting effects**, noting whether the lighting **gradually or suddenly changes** in position, direction, color, brightness, or shape over time. If the lighting shifts due to **flickering, pulsing, or dimming**, describe its **timing and impact** on the visual composition.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting effects. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Lens and Optical Effects:** The video uses a mist diffusion filter to soften the image, creating a dreamy, glowing effect. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Light Reflections:** No significant light reflections in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Natural Lighting Effects:** No significant natural lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Artificial or Artistic Lighting Effects:** The video features bright, colorful city lighting from various artificial sources. (please include and explain these effects.)\n\n**Volumetric Lighting:** No significant volumetric lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Shadow Patterns or Gobo Lighting Effects:** No distinct or noteworthy shadow patterns or Gobo lighting effects in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lighting Dynamics:** No significant lighting dynamics in this video. (no need to mention).\n\n**Other Dynamics: The video showcases an explosion with a sudden burst of flames, matter, and outward force. (please include and explain these effects.)",
    "pre_caption": "The video employs a mist diffusion filter, which softens the image and creates a dreamy, glowing effect, enhancing the overall ambiance. This filter diffuses the light, making it appear more ethereal and less harsh. The cityscape is illuminated by numerous artificial lights, including street lamps, building lights, and industrial structures, which cast a warm, golden glow across the scene. These lights are static but contribute significantly to the atmosphere, highlighting the urban landscape against the dark sky. The explosions in the video introduce dynamic elements, with bursts of flames and billowing smoke that momentarily disrupt the otherwise steady lighting. These explosions are sudden and intense, adding a dramatic contrast to the otherwise calm and serene urban setting. The combination of the misty filter and the artificial city lights creates a visually striking and somewhat surreal urban nightscape.",
