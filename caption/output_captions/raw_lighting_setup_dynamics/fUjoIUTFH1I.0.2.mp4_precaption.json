    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an outdoor environment..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The primary light source in the video is sunlight.\n\n**Sunlight Condition:** The video features soft, diffused sunlight on an overcast day.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features soft, diffused lighting with gentle illumination.",
    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor scene shrouded in dense fog, creating a mysterious and ethereal atmosphere. The primary light source is sunlight, which is diffused through the thick fog, resulting in a soft, even illumination that lacks sharp contrasts. The fog acts as a natural diffuser, scattering the light and reducing its intensity, which contributes to the overall softness of the lighting. There are no distinct light directions or notable changes in lighting sources throughout the sequence, as the fog maintains a consistent effect on the light. The contrast ratio is relatively low, with flat lighting dominating the scene due to the fog's diffusing properties. This creates a uniform appearance where details are not sharply defined, enhancing the sense of depth and mystery in the video.",
