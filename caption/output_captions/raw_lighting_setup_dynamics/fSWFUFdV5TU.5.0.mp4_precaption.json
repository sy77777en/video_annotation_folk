    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an indoor environment.\n\n**Light Source(s):** The primary light source in the video is sunlight. The primary light source(s) in the video change(s) over time or include(s) a rare light source that is not the sun, fire, moon and stars, or artificial light.\n\n**Sunlight Condition:** The video features regular daylight with balanced brightness, neither particularly hard nor soft.\n\n**Light Quality:** The light quality varies across the scene, making it difficult to categorize.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject has minimal contrast (1:1 to 1:2), creating a flat lighting effect.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** There is a noticeable light source consistently illuminating the subject from behind (backlighting), as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** Silhouette lighting creates a dark outline of the foreground subject against a bright background.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors, primarily illuminated by sunlight, which changes over time, suggesting the presence of an additional rare light source. The sunlight provides regular daylight with balanced brightness, neither particularly hard nor soft, but the light quality varies across the scene. The lighting on the subject is flat, with minimal contrast (1:1 to 1:2), and consistently features backlighting from the camera's perspective. This backlighting creates a silhouette effect, outlining the subject darkly against a brighter background, emphasizing the subject's shape and form without revealing details. The interaction of light with the subject remains consistent, maintaining the silhouette effect throughout the video.",
