    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an indoor environment..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The primary light source in the video is sunlight. The primary light source(s) in the video change(s) over time or include(s) a rare light source that is not the sun, fire, moon and stars, or artificial light.\n\n**Sunlight Condition:** The video features regular daylight with balanced brightness, neither particularly hard nor soft.\n\n**Light Quality:** The light quality varies across the scene, making it difficult to categorize.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject has minimal contrast (1:1 to 1:2), creating a flat lighting effect.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** There is a noticeable light source illuminating the subject from behind (backlighting), as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** Silhouette lighting creates a dark outline of the foreground subject against a bright background.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is set in a dimly lit room, primarily illuminated by natural sunlight filtering through a window on the right side. The primary light source is the sunlight, which casts a soft glow into the room, creating a contrast between the brightly lit areas near the window and the darker regions elsewhere. The light quality is soft, with the sunlight diffusing through the curtains, resulting in a gentle illumination that enhances the silhouette effect of the subject. The subject, a person wearing glasses and a dark coat, is positioned facing away from the camera, with their back silhouetted against the lighter background. The camera remains stationary, capturing the subject's slow, deliberate movements as they turn slightly, revealing more of their profile. The overall lighting creates a dramatic and contemplative atmosphere, emphasizing the subject's form and movement within the shadowy space.",
