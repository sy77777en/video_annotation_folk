    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video shows a synthetic or 2D environment with unrealistic lighting effects..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video lacks a realistic light source, and the lighting does not follow natural physics.\n\n**Light Quality:** The light quality varies across the scene, making it difficult to categorize.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a fantastical, otherworldly forest with a predominantly blue and purple color palette, suggesting a magical or ethereal atmosphere. The primary light source appears to be a glowing orb at the center of the frame, emitting a bright, almost ethereal light that illuminates the surrounding area. This light source is synthetic, likely created through CGI, and it casts dynamic shadows and highlights across the intricate tree branches and foliage. The quality of the light is soft, creating a gentle interplay between light and shadow that enhances the mystical feel of the environment. As the character moves through the forest, the light from the orb shifts subtly, altering the intensity and direction of illumination, which adds a sense of depth and movement to the scene. The contrast ratio is relatively high, with the bright light from the orb standing out sharply against the darker, shadowed areas of the forest, creating a dramatic visual effect. The light direction is primarily frontal, with the orb positioned centrally, but the shifting perspective as the character navigates the terrain introduces slight variations in the angle and intensity of the light.",
