    "pre_caption": "The video is set in an indoor environment illuminated by practical artificial light sources, likely LED panels, which are not directly visible but contribute to the vibrant neon glow that dominates the scene. The primary light sources appear to be strategically placed around the room, creating dynamic geometric patterns of light and shadow. These lights are predominantly blue and red, casting sharp, angular shadows and highlights that interact with the dancers' movements. The lighting quality alternates between hard and soft, depending on the proximity of the light sources to the subjects and the angle at which they are directed. This interplay results in a high contrast scenario, with stark differences between the brightly lit areas and deep shadows, especially noticeable when the dancers move through the illuminated pathways. The light direction is primarily frontal and slightly angled, enhancing the three-dimensional appearance of the dancers and the neon structures. The overall effect is a visually striking blend of movement and light, emphasizing the choreography and the futuristic setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an indoor environment..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video contains practical artificial light with its source(s) clearly visible in the frame.\n\n**Light Quality:** The light quality in the scene changes between hard and soft over time.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject is complex (e.g., 2D/2.5D videos) or varies due to changes in lighting, camera motion, subject transitions, or multiple subjects with different lighting conditions.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** The light direction on the subject is complex to analyze.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** No special lighting effects are observed on the subject. (no need to mention).",

The white-blueish lights in background in geometric shape are flashing on and off twice during this video. The red lights are actually beam light that move direction across the room, sometime hitting the dancing subjects with bright highlights. Remove this sentence \"The lighting quality alternates between hard and soft, depending on the proximity of the light sources to the subjects and the angle at which they are directed.\" because the light quality is complex to analyze; the background blue-white light are softly illuminating the room when they are on, otherwise the room goes to darkness with only red beam light and a overhead white light the source itself not visible in the frame. The dancing figures are illuminated by a lot of light sources, where top overhead light is always consistent, red beam light hit them with some reflected beams, in short there are some light contrast on these subjects like bright highlights on top of their head. The light direction is therefore not frontal at all, but mostly top light plus some ambient light. ",
