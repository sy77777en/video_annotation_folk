    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an outdoor environment..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The primary light source in the video is sunlight. The video contains practical artificial light with its source(s) clearly visible in the frame.\n\n**Sunlight Condition:** The video features soft, diffused sunlight on an overcast day.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features soft, diffused lighting with gentle illumination.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject is complex (e.g., 2D/2.5D videos) or varies due to changes in lighting, camera motion, subject transitions, or multiple subjects with different lighting conditions.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** The light direction on the subject is complex to analyze.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** No special lighting effects are observed on the subject. (no need to mention).",
    "pre_caption": "The video is set in an outdoor environment under soft, diffused sunlight, likely on an overcast day, which creates a gentle and even illumination across the scene. The primary light source is natural sunlight, providing a consistent and soft quality that minimizes harsh shadows. The artificial light sources, such as the streetlights visible in the background, add subtle highlights and depth to the scene, enhancing the overall ambiance without overpowering the natural light. The camera captures the subject from various angles, but the lighting remains relatively constant, maintaining a balanced contrast ratio suitable for showcasing the subject's details without dramatic shadows or overexposure. The light direction appears to be a combination of ambient light and possibly some directional light from the streetlights, contributing to the overall soft and even lighting throughout the sequence.",
