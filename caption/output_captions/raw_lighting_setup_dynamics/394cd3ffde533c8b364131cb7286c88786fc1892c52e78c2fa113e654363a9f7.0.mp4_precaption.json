    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an outdoor environment..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The primary light source in the video is sunlight.\n\n**Sunlight Condition:** The video features bright, direct sunlight with strong intensity.\n\n**Light Quality:** The light quality in the scene changes between hard and soft over time.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject is complex (e.g., 2D/2.5D videos) or varies due to changes in lighting, camera motion, subject transitions, or multiple subjects with different lighting conditions.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** The light direction on the subject is complex to analyze.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** No special lighting effects are observed on the subject. (no need to mention).",
    "pre_caption": "The video is set outdoors under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds, suggesting a sunny day. The primary light source is the sun, which provides bright, direct illumination. The lighting quality alternates between hard and soft, depending on the angle of the sun relative to the subject and the surrounding environment. As the rider moves through various urban settings, the shadows cast by buildings and trees shift, creating dynamic contrasts. The rider's reflective helmet and leather jacket catch the sunlight at different angles, enhancing the visual texture. The overall lighting maintains a high contrast ratio, with well-defined highlights and deep shadows, contributing to the sharpness of the image. The light direction is primarily frontal, with occasional side lighting from the sun as the rider navigates through streets lined with trees and buildings.",
