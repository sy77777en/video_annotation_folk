    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video shows a synthetic or 2D environment with unrealistic lighting effects..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video lacks a realistic light source, and the lighting does not follow natural physics.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features soft, diffused lighting with gentle illumination.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject is complex (e.g., 2D/2.5D videos) or varies due to changes in lighting, camera motion, subject transitions, or multiple subjects with different lighting conditions.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** The light direction on the subject is complex to analyze.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** No special lighting effects are observed on the subject. (no need to mention).",
    "pre_caption": "The video showcases a dark, almost entirely black environment with minimal lighting. The primary light source appears to be an off-camera studio light, creating a soft, diffused glow that illuminates parts of the scene. This light source is likely positioned at a low angle, casting subtle shadows and highlighting textures on the objects within the frame. The lighting quality is soft, with no harsh contrasts, suggesting a controlled indoor setting. The contrast ratio is relatively low, maintaining a flat appearance with a slight gradient from light to dark. The light direction seems to be coming from above and slightly behind the subjects, creating a gentle backlight effect. There are no distinct lighting effects applied to the subjects, and the overall scene remains consistent throughout the frames, with no noticeable changes in lighting or camera movement.",
