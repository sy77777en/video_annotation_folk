    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor urban night scene illuminated by practical artificial light sources, likely from streetlamps and vehicle headlights, which are not directly visible but contribute to the overall ambiance. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a moody and atmospheric setting. The primary light source appears to be the distant vehicle headlights, casting a glow that gradually illuminates the figure walking away from the camera. This light source is positioned at a considerable distance, resulting in a low contrast ratio, typical of long-distance lighting. The subject, a person in a coat, is silhouetted against the brighter background, emphasizing their form against the dimly lit surroundings. The light direction is primarily frontal, with the vehicle headlights providing a forward illumination that enhances the sense of depth and movement towards the horizon. The overall lighting setup contributes to a cinematic and somewhat mysterious tone, with the interplay of light and shadow adding to the visual storytelling.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an outdoor environment.\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video contains practical artificial light with its source(s) clearly visible in the frame. The video is lit by unclear light sources (neither clear sunlight nor firelight) that are unseen in the frame.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features soft, diffused lighting.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting contrast on the subject is hard to analyze due to: (1) stylized formats (e.g., 2D/2.5D), (2) variation from lighting, camera, or subject changes, or (3) multiple subjects with different lighting.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** The light direction on the subject is complex to analyze.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** Silhouette lighting creates a dark outline of the foreground subject against a bright background.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Make your paragraph concise and simple, including as many video details as possible, without mentioning what is not present. Make your paragraph concise and simple, including as many video details as possible, without mentioning what is not present.",
