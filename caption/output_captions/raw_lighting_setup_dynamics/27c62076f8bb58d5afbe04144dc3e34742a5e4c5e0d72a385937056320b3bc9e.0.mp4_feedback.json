    "pre_caption": "The video is set in an outdoor environment with the primary light source being natural sunlight. The sunlight is soft and diffused, indicative of an overcast day, which provides gentle illumination across the scene. This results in a soft lighting quality with minimal shadows and a flat lighting effect, characterized by a low contrast ratio of 1:1 to 1:2. The subjects, which are the signs, are illuminated with ambient light, ensuring even exposure without any harsh highlights or deep shadows. The overall lighting is consistent, with no significant changes or special effects applied throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an outdoor environment.\n\n**Light Source(s):** Sunlight is a primary light source.\n\n**Sunlight Condition:** The video features soft, diffused sunlight from overcast skies or during blue hour.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features soft, diffused lighting.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):** The subject is lit with high-key lighting. The lighting on the subject has minimal contrast ratio, creating a flat lighting effect (e.g., 1:1 to 1:2).\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** The subject is lit with ambient light, with soft illumination and no clearly dominant directional source.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** No special lighting effects are observed on the subject. (no need to mention).\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Make your paragraph concise and simple, including as many video details as possible, without mentioning what is not present. Make your paragraph concise and simple, including as many video details as possible, without mentioning what is not present.",
