    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an indoor environment..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video is lit by unclear light sources (neither clear sunlight nor firelight) that are unseen in the frame.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features soft, diffused lighting with gentle illumination.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):** The subject is lit by low-key lighting. The lighting on the subject has a high contrast ratio (1:8 or higher), creating a strong distinction between bright and dark areas.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** The subject is illuminated with soft, ambient light.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** The lighting setup creates a polished, professional appearance, common in portrait photography or videography.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is set in an indoor environment, illuminated by soft, diffused lighting that creates a warm and intimate atmosphere. The primary light source appears to be an unseen lamp, possibly positioned above or slightly to the side of the subjects, casting a gentle glow that highlights their hands and the objects they are handling. This lighting setup results in a low-key, high-contrast ratio (1:8 or higher), emphasizing the textures of the clothing and the delicate movements of the hands. The light direction is primarily ambient, with no harsh shadows, suggesting a soft, even illumination. The overall effect is one of warmth and closeness, typical of a cozy indoor setting where attention is focused on the interaction between the two individuals.",
