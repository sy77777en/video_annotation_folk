    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an outdoor environment..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The primary light source in the video is sunlight. The video contains practical artificial light with its source(s) clearly visible in the frame. The video is lit by unclear light sources (neither clear sunlight nor firelight) that are unseen in the frame.\n\n**Sunlight Condition:** The video features soft, diffused sunlight on an overcast day.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features soft, diffused lighting with gentle illumination.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject has a normal contrast ratio (1:2 to 1:8), providing a balanced distinction between bright and dark areas.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** There is a noticeable light source illuminating the subject from below (bottom lighting), as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective. The subject is illuminated with soft, ambient light.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** No special lighting effects are observed on the subject. (no need to mention).",
    "pre_caption": "The video is set in an outdoor environment under a cloudy sky, which diffuses the sunlight, creating a soft and even illumination. The primary light source is the ambient daylight, which is soft and diffused due to the overcast conditions. This results in a consistent, low-contrast lighting setup with no harsh shadows, suggesting a normal contrast ratio (1:2 to 1:8). The light direction appears to be primarily from above, with some ambient light coming from the sides, contributing to the overall softness. The subject, dressed in a spacesuit, is evenly lit, with no distinct lighting effects applied, maintaining a neutral and realistic appearance. The background, featuring a large structure and what seems to be a futuristic setting, is also softly lit, enhancing the immersive atmosphere of the scene.",
