This natural light source produces a mix of hard and soft lighting throughout the scene. The subject is illuminated with a normal contrast ratio, creating a balanced look between bright and shadowed areas. Light consistently hits the subject from the side, supplemented by ambient light, resulting in a professionally executed, portrait-style lighting effect.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an outdoor environment.\n\n**Light Source(s):** Sunlight is a primary light source.\n\n**Sunlight Condition:** The video features warm, golden sunlight at sunrise or sunset.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video contains a mix of hard and soft lighting.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject has a normal contrast ratio (1:2 to 1:8), providing a balanced distinction between bright and dark areas.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** There is a noticeable light source consistently illuminating the subject from one side (side lighting), as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective. The subject is lit with ambient light, with soft illumination and no clearly dominant directional source.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** The lighting setup appears professionally done (e.g., portrait or stage lighting).\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Make your paragraph concise and simple, including as many video details as possible, without mentioning what is not present.
