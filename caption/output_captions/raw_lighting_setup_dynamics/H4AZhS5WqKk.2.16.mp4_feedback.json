    "pre_caption": "The scene is set indoors, featuring practical artificial lighting from a chandelier with cylindrical glass tubes emitting warm, golden light. The primary light source is the chandelier itself, which provides both direct and diffused illumination across the room. The light quality alternates between soft and hard, depending on the angle and proximity to the light source. As the character interacts with the chandelier, the light dynamically shifts, creating varying contrasts and shadows that highlight the character's movements and expressions. The lighting is primarily frontal, with some side lighting accentuating the character's features and the intricate details of the chandelier. The overall effect is a dynamic interplay of light and shadow that enhances the visual storytelling within the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an indoor environment..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video contains practical artificial light with its source(s) clearly visible in the frame.\n\n**Light Quality:** The light quality in the scene changes between hard and soft over time.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject is complex (e.g., 2D/2.5D videos) or varies due to changes in lighting, camera motion, subject transitions, or multiple subjects with different lighting conditions.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** The light direction on the subject is complex to analyze.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** No special lighting effects are observed on the subject. (no need to mention).",

It only changes because as the cat and mouse play on chandelier shaped light it seems to break and flahses twice to emit very bright white light that overexpose the entire scene and accentuate contrast on chacater (otherwise they are normal contrast ratio on these two subjects).
