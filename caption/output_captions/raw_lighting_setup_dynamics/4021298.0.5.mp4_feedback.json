    "pre_caption": "The video is set in an outdoor environment under bright, direct sunlight with strong intensity, creating a hard lighting effect. The sunlight is predominantly from the upper left, casting sharp shadows and highlighting the textures of the rocky terrain and the colorful clothing of the people. The light direction is primarily from the front relative to the subjects, enhancing their visibility and details. The contrast ratio is high, with distinct differences between the illuminated faces and the darker shadows, contributing to a dynamic interplay of light and shadow that emphasizes the rugged landscape and the vibrant attire of the individuals. There are no noticeable changes in the light sources or significant variations in the lighting quality throughout the sequence, maintaining a consistent and vivid depiction of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an outdoor environment.\n\n**Light Source(s):** The primary light source in the video is sunlight.\n\n**Sunlight Condition:** The video features bright, direct sunlight with strong intensity.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features hard lighting with strong, directional light.",
