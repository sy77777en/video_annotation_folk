    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video shows a synthetic or 2D environment with unrealistic lighting effects..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video lacks a realistic light source, and the lighting does not follow natural physics.\n\n**Light Quality:** The light quality varies across the scene, making it difficult to categorize.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a synthetic, 2D environment with vibrant, neon-like lighting that creates an otherworldly atmosphere. The primary light sources appear to be artificial, likely CGI-generated, as they emit a consistent, intense glow that illuminates the scene uniformly. The light quality is predominantly soft, with no harsh shadows, suggesting a diffuse light source possibly from above or within the environment itself. This softness is maintained consistently throughout the frames, with no noticeable changes in the light's intensity or direction. The lighting interacts with the characters and objects in the scene by casting a bright, almost ethereal glow, enhancing their visibility against the darker background. The contrast ratio is relatively high, with a strong differentiation between the brightly lit elements and the darker surroundings, creating a visually striking effect. The light direction seems to be primarily frontal, as the characters and objects are evenly illuminated, with minimal shadowing. There are no distinct lighting effects applied beyond the overall soft, neon ambiance, which contributes to the futuristic and immersive feel of the scene.",
