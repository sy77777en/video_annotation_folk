    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a fantastical, cave-like environment with a predominantly purple and orange color palette, suggesting an otherworldly or magical setting. The lighting is synthetic, likely created through CGI or digital rendering, which gives the scene a vibrant and somewhat surreal appearance. The light quality is soft, with no harsh shadows, creating a gentle illumination that enhances the dreamlike atmosphere. The light seems to come from within the cave itself, possibly emanating from glowing elements or magical sources, contributing to the overall ethereal glow. The lighting remains consistent throughout the frames, with no noticeable changes in light sources or intensity. The subject, a stylized bird-like creature, is well-lit, allowing for clear visibility of its features and movements. The lighting on the subject is balanced, maintaining a moderate contrast ratio that highlights the character's form without overwhelming details. The light direction appears to be a combination of ambient and slightly directional lighting, coming from above and slightly to the sides, which creates subtle highlights and shadows that add depth to the character's form. Overall, the lighting contributes to the enchanting and mysterious ambiance of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video shows a synthetic or 2D environment with unrealistic lighting effects.\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video lacks a realistic light source, and the lighting does not follow natural physics.\n\n**Light Quality:** The light quality varies across the scene, making it difficult to categorize.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject is complex (e.g., 2D/2.5D videos) or varies due to changes in lighting, camera motion, subject transitions, or multiple subjects with different lighting conditions.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** The light direction on the subject is complex to analyze.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** No special lighting effects are observed on the subject. (no need to mention).",
