    "pre_caption": "The video showcases a dynamic outdoor environment with a mix of natural and possibly synthetic lighting elements. The primary light source appears to be moonlight, given the presence of a full moon in the sky, which casts a soft glow over the landscape. This creates a serene atmosphere with a balance between soft and slightly harder shadows, depending on the time of day and cloud cover. The lighting quality fluctuates, with some areas illuminated more brightly than others, suggesting a combination of direct and diffused light. The light direction seems to vary, with some frames showing light coming from above and others from the side, contributing to the depth and dimensionality of the scene. The overall contrast ratio is moderate, providing enough detail to distinguish various elements within the environment, such as the autumn foliage and the distant mountains. There are no distinct lighting effects applied to the subjects, maintaining a natural and immersive feel throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video shows a synthetic or 2D environment with unrealistic lighting effects.\n\n**Light Source(s):** The primary light source(s) in the video change(s) over time or include(s) a rare light source that is not the sun, fire, moon and stars, or artificial light.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video contains a mix of hard and soft lighting.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject is complex (e.g., 2D/2.5D videos) or varies due to changes in lighting, camera motion, subject transitions, or multiple subjects with different lighting conditions.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** The light direction on the subject is complex to analyze.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** No special lighting effects are observed on the subject. (no need to mention).",
