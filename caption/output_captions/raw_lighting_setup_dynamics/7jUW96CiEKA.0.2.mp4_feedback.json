    "pre_caption": "The video is set in an outdoor environment with the primary light source being natural sunlight. The sunlight condition is regular daylight, providing balanced brightness that is neither particularly hard nor soft. The scene features soft, diffused lighting with gentle illumination, creating a normal contrast ratio (1:2 to 1:8) on the subject, which allows for a balanced distinction between bright and dark areas. The subject is illuminated from multiple directions: backlighting from behind, top lighting from above, and side lighting from one side, as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective. Additionally, the subject benefits from soft, ambient light, enhancing the natural and serene atmosphere without any special lighting effects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an outdoor environment.\n\n**Light Source(s):** The primary light source in the video is sunlight.\n\n**Sunlight Condition:** The video features regular daylight with balanced brightness, neither particularly hard nor soft.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features soft, diffused lighting with gentle illumination.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject has a normal contrast ratio (1:2 to 1:8), providing a balanced distinction between bright and dark areas.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** There is a noticeable light source consistently illuminating the subject from behind (backlighting), as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective. There is a noticeable light source consistently illuminating the subject from the top (top lighting), as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective. There is a noticeable light source consistently illuminating the subject from one side (side lighting), as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective. The subject is consistently illuminated with soft, ambient light.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** No special lighting effects are observed on the subject. (no need to mention).",
