    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an outdoor environment..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video is lit by unclear light sources (neither clear sunlight nor firelight) that are unseen in the frame.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features soft, diffused lighting with gentle illumination.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject has a normal contrast ratio (1:2 to 1:8), providing a balanced distinction between bright and dark areas.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** There is a noticeable light source illuminating the subject from behind (backlighting), as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective. The subject is illuminated with soft, ambient light.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** Silhouette lighting creates a dark outline of the foreground subject against a bright background.",
    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor scene bathed in a soft, diffused light that suggests either early morning or late evening, given the low angle and the long shadows cast by the figures. The primary light source appears to be a distant, possibly sunlit opening or a light source positioned outside the frame, creating a hazy, ethereal atmosphere. This light is not harsh but rather gentle, contributing to the overall moody and atmospheric feel of the scene. The light interacts with the subjects by casting subtle shadows and creating a silhouette effect on the person walking away from the camera, emphasizing their form against the brighter background. The contrast ratio is moderate, allowing for a clear distinction between the illuminated and shadowed areas, which enhances the dramatic effect of the silhouettes. The light direction is predominantly backlit, as the subjects are facing away from the camera, with the light coming from behind them, creating a strong silhouette effect. The overall lighting setup contributes to a sense of mystery and intrigue, typical of a cinematic or noir-inspired aesthetic.",
