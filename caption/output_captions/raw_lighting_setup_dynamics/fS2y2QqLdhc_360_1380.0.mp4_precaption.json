    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an outdoor environment..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video contains practical artificial light with its source(s) clearly visible in the frame.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features soft, diffused lighting with gentle illumination.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is set in an outdoor environment at night, featuring practical artificial lighting sources, such as streetlamps and building lights, which are visible within the frame. These lights provide a soft, diffused illumination that gently lights the scene, creating a calm and ambient atmosphere. The lighting quality is predominantly soft, reducing harsh shadows and providing even coverage across the area. The interaction with subjects, such as people or objects, is characterized by a normal contrast ratio, likely around 1:4 to 1:8, allowing for clear visibility without stark differences between light and shadow. The light direction is primarily ambient, coming from multiple sources around the scene, ensuring that no single direction dominates the lighting. Notably, the video includes dynamic lighting effects from electrical discharges, which introduce brief, intense bursts of light, creating high contrast moments and highlighting the structure in the center. These effects add dramatic visual interest and contrast to the otherwise softly lit environment.",
