    "pre_caption": "The video is set outdoors under a cloudy sky, which diffuses the sunlight, creating a soft and even light across the scene. The primary light source is natural daylight, with no significant changes in intensity or direction observed throughout the sequence. The light quality is consistently soft, with minimal shadows, suggesting that the sun is either low in the sky or obscured by clouds, resulting in a diffused and even illumination. This soft lighting enhances the visibility of details in the environment, such as the wet pavement reflecting the light and the textures of the buildings. The subjects in the video, including the pedestrians walking along the waterfront, are evenly lit, with no harsh contrasts or dramatic shadows. The overall lighting maintains a balanced and natural appearance, typical of an overcast day in Venice.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an outdoor environment.\n\n**Light Source(s):** The primary light source in the video is sunlight.\n\n**Sunlight Condition:** The video features regular daylight with balanced brightness, neither particularly hard nor soft.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features soft, diffused lighting with gentle illumination.",
