    "pre_caption": "The video is set in an indoor environment, illuminated by artificial light sources, likely from studio lighting equipment visible in the background. The primary light source appears to be a large, diffused softbox positioned to the left of the frame, casting a soft shadow of the standing individual onto the backdrop. This softbox provides even illumination, minimizing harsh shadows and creating a balanced exposure across the subject's figure. Additionally, there seems to be another light source, possibly a smaller key light, directed at the subject from the front, enhancing the overall brightness and detail. The lighting quality is predominantly soft, with subtle variations in intensity that create a smooth gradient of light and shadow. The contrast ratio is relatively low, suggesting a normal range suitable for capturing details without extreme highlights or deep shadows. The light direction is primarily frontal, with slight variations as the subject moves slightly, ensuring consistent illumination. The polished appearance of the subject suggests the use of professional lighting techniques, typical in fashion or portrait photography.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an indoor environment.\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video is lit by unclear light sources (neither clear sunlight nor firelight) that are unseen in the frame.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video contains a mix of hard and soft lighting.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject is complex (e.g., 2D/2.5D videos) or varies due to changes in lighting, camera motion, subject transitions, or multiple subjects with different lighting conditions.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** There is a noticeable light source consistently illuminating the subject from the front, as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective. There is a noticeable light source consistently illuminating the subject from one side (side lighting), as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective. The subject is consistently illuminated with soft, ambient light.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** The lighting setup appears professionally done (e.g., portrait or stage lighting).",
