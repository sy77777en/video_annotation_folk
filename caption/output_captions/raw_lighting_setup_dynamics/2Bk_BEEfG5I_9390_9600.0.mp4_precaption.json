    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an indoor environment..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video is lit by unclear light sources (neither clear sunlight nor firelight) that are unseen in the frame.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features hard lighting with strong, directional light.",
    "pre_caption": "The video showcases an indoor setting illuminated by a combination of natural and artificial light sources, creating a dynamic interplay of shadows and highlights. The primary light source appears to be natural sunlight filtering through an unseen window, casting intricate patterns of light and shadow across the marble floor. This creates a soft, dappled effect that contrasts with the harder, more defined shadows cast by the ornate wooden railing and other architectural elements. The light quality is predominantly soft due to the diffusion through the window, but there are moments where the light becomes slightly harder, particularly when the sun's angle changes, creating sharper contrasts between light and shadow. The overall lighting setup results in a high contrast ratio, with the bright spots of sunlight standing out sharply against the darker areas of the room. The light direction is primarily from above and slightly angled, emphasizing the texture of the marble and the intricate details of the wooden railings. As the video progresses, the interplay of light and shadow evolves, reflecting subtle movements within the space, such as the shifting position of objects or the passing of time.",
