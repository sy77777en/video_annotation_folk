    "pre_caption": "The video showcases a night vision effect, which is a form of artificial lighting designed to enhance visibility in low-light conditions. The primary light source is the night vision device itself, which emits a green hue, creating a monochromatic and somewhat eerie atmosphere. This type of lighting is inherently artificial and non-realistic, as it uses infrared technology to detect heat signatures rather than traditional light sources. The quality of the light is soft due to the nature of night vision, which diffuses the light to reduce harsh shadows and create a more even illumination. The interaction with the subject is consistent throughout the video, as the night vision effect uniformly bathes the scene in a green glow, highlighting the subject's facial features and creating a strong contrast against the darker background. The overall lighting characteristic is one of high contrast, with the subject standing out sharply against the dark surroundings. There are no significant changes in lighting sources or notable variations in light quality, as the night vision effect remains constant throughout the frames shown.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The scene type (indoor or outdoor) is unclear, ambiguous, or changing throughout the video.\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video lacks a realistic light source, and the lighting does not follow natural physics.\n\n**Light Quality:** The light quality varies across the scene, making it difficult to categorize.",
