    "pre_caption": "The scene is set indoors, illuminated primarily by practical artificial light, likely from a lamp situated on a side table to the left. This light source casts a warm glow that highlights the door and part of the wall, creating a soft ambiance. The light quality transitions from relatively soft near the lamp to harder shadows further away, suggesting the presence of additional, less direct light sources or the natural diffusion of light through nearby surfaces. The contrast ratio is moderate, leaning towards normal, with noticeable differences in brightness between the lit areas and the darker recesses of the room. The light direction appears to be a combination of frontal and slightly angled, contributing to the depth and dimensionality of the space. There are no distinct lighting effects applied, but the interplay of light and shadow creates a dynamic and realistic atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an indoor environment..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video contains practical artificial light with its source(s) clearly visible in the frame.\n\n**Light Quality:** The light quality in the scene changes between hard and soft over time.",
