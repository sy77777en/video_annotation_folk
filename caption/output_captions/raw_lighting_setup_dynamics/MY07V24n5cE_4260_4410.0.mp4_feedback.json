    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a dimly lit, possibly underground or enclosed space, creating an eerie and somber atmosphere. The primary light source appears to be a supernatural or magical energy emanating from the central figure lying on the stone platform, casting dynamic, swirling patterns of light that shift and evolve. This light source is both soft and dynamic, creating a stark contrast against the dark surroundings. The light's quality is ethereal, with a bluish tint that enhances the mystical feel of the scene. The light interacts with the subjects by highlighting their silhouettes and casting dramatic shadows, contributing to the high contrast ratio (above 1:8) that emphasizes the emotional gravity of the moment. The light direction is primarily from above and slightly to the sides, creating a sense of depth and focus on the central figure. The overall lighting setup is synthetic, likely achieved through CGI or advanced digital rendering techniques, which allows for the creation of the intricate light patterns and the interplay of light and shadow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video shows a synthetic or 2D environment with unrealistic lighting effects..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video lacks a realistic light source, and the lighting does not follow natural physics.\n\n**Light Quality:** The light quality varies across the scene, making it difficult to categorize.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject has a normal contrast ratio (1:2 to 1:8), providing a balanced distinction between bright and dark areas.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** There is a noticeable light source illuminating the subject from the top (top lighting), as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective. There is a noticeable light source illuminating the subject from one side (side lighting), as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** No special lighting effects are observed on the subject. (no need to mention).",
