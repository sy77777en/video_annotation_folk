    "pre_caption": "The scene is characterized by a predominantly red lighting setup, which suggests an artificial light source, possibly CGI or synthetic lighting given the uniformity and intensity. The lighting quality is hard, creating sharp contrasts and deep shadows, indicative of a strong directional light source. This is evident in the silhouetted figures against the vibrant red backdrop. As the scene progresses, the lighting becomes even more intense and focused, casting dramatic shadows and enhancing the sense of depth and atmosphere. The transition from a dimly lit environment to a more intense red glow suggests a shift in mood or setting, possibly moving from an indoor space to a more enclosed or dramatic area. The overall effect is one of heightened tension and mystery, with the red lighting playing a crucial role in establishing the scene's tone.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The scene type is unclear, ambiguous, or changing throughout the video..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The primary light source(s) in the video change(s) over time or include(s) a rare light source that is not the sun, fire, moon and stars, or artificial light.\n\n**Light Quality:** The light quality in the scene changes between hard and soft over time.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject is complex (e.g., 2D/2.5D videos) or varies due to changes in lighting, camera motion, subject transitions, or multiple subjects with different lighting conditions.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** The light direction on the subject is complex to analyze.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** No special lighting effects are observed on the subject. (no need to mention).",
