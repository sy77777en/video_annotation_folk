    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an indoor environment..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The video is lit by unclear light sources (neither clear sunlight nor firelight) that are unseen in the frame.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features soft, diffused lighting with gentle illumination.\n\n**Light Contrast on Subject(s):**  The lighting on the subject has a normal contrast ratio (1:2 to 1:8), providing a balanced distinction between bright and dark areas.\n\n**Light Direction(s) on Subject(s):** There is a noticeable light source illuminating the subject from the front, as seen from the camera\u2019s perspective. The subject is illuminated with soft, ambient light.\n\n**Lighting Effects on Subject(s):** No special lighting effects are observed on the subject. (no need to mention).",
    "pre_caption": "The video is set in an indoor environment, illuminated by soft, diffused lighting that creates a gentle and even illumination across the scene. The primary light source is not visible within the frame, suggesting it may be coming from overhead studio lights or a similar setup designed for controlled lighting in a laboratory-like setting. This type of lighting ensures that the watch and the tools being used are clearly visible without harsh shadows or overly bright spots. The lighting maintains a normal contrast ratio, allowing for detailed observation of the watch's features and the actions performed on it. The light direction appears to be predominantly frontal, as the subject (the watch) is evenly lit from the front, ensuring all details are visible and well-defined. There are no special lighting effects applied, keeping the focus on the practical demonstration of the watch's durability and the testing process.",
