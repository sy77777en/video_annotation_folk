    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor setting under an overcast sky, where the primary light source is sunlight, which is diffused and soft due to the cloud cover. This creates a consistent, even illumination across the scene, minimizing harsh shadows and maintaining a relatively flat lighting condition. The light quality is soft, with no significant variations in intensity or direction, suggesting that the sun is positioned at a high angle relative to the ground, typical of midday conditions. There are no distinct lighting effects applied, and the overall contrast remains low, with a normal range of 1:4\u20131:8, ensuring that details are visible without strong contrasts. The light direction appears to be ambient, coming from above and slightly diffused through the clouds, contributing to the even and subdued atmosphere of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the **lighting setup and dynamics** in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of its **light sources, quality, and interaction with subjects**. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting. Your goal is to describe the **overall lighting characteristics** and any significant variations in a clear, natural paragraph. Avoid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" Return only the description.  \n\nFirst, identify the **primary light sources** in the scene, specifying whether they are **natural (sunlight, moonlight, firelight), artificial (visible lamps, LEDs, off-camera studio lighting), or non-realistic (CGI, synthetic lighting)**. If the scene is indoors or outdoors, describe how the environment affects the lighting\u2014indoor light is often diffused by surface reflections, while outdoor sunlight is harsher on clear days and softer on overcast days. Mention any **notable changes in lighting sources**, such as a streetlamp turning on or firelight fading.  \n\nNext, describe the **lighting quality**, indicating whether it is **soft or hard**. If the quality varies across the scene, specify how different areas are affected, considering the distance and intensity of the light sources.  \n\nIf subjects are present, analyze how lighting interacts with them. Specify the **contrast ratio**\u2014whether it has **flat lighting (1:1\u20131:2), normal contrast (1:4\u20131:8), or high contrast (above 1:8)**. Describe the **light direction** in relation to the subject and camera, such as **front, back, side, top, bottom, or ambient light**. If distinct **lighting effects** are applied, mention them, such as **Portrait Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, Silhouette Lighting, or Rim Light**. If the contrast or light direction shifts throughout the video, specify the **transition**.\n\nWe have already provided some guidance on describing the aforementioned aspects of lighting setup. Please use these as references to expand your description. Keep your description a natural and brief paragraph without any formatting.\n\n**Scene Type:** The video is set in an outdoor environment..\n\n**Light Source(s):** The primary light source in the video is sunlight.\n\n**Sunlight Condition:** The video features soft, diffused sunlight on an overcast day.\n\n**Light Quality:** The scene in this video features soft, diffused lighting with gentle illumination.",

The camera is looking up at the sky under a narrow gap (not sure if this is the best phrasing, help me fix) between two buildings that are very dark and even underexposed since the sunlight seems very weak so they cannot directly illuminate the buildings at all. The very dim lighting on the building appears soft diffused light from overcast sky, hheavily diffused. don't mention the light contrast it doesn't apply here, but you can say the top of the building are brighter compared to lower that are completely underexposed ",
