It presents a street-level view featuring a modern frosted glass barrier atop a dark stone wall juxtaposed with older, weathered building facades. One building has a pale green, graffiti-covered door adorned with posters, while the adjacent one features a large window covered by light curtains and displaying small signs. The emphasis is on the overall scene, textures, and architectural contrast, characteristic of a scenery shot where the environment itself is the focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
