    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, beginning with a low-angle view of a weathered, old stone church tower and its spire set against a bright, partly cloudy sky. As the camera pulls back, it reveals the tower's context within a bustling city street, flanked by a mix of modern glass-fronted office buildings and older brick structures. The shot does not have a main subject; instead, the focus is on the architectural atmosphere and the juxtaposition of historical and contemporary design. The camera's movement serves to establish the scale of the environment, emphasizing the place itself rather than any single entity within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
