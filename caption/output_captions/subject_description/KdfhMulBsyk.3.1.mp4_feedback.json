    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a London street at night during a rain shower. The wet, dark pavement glistens, creating vivid, elongated reflections of the bright lights from street lamps and closed storefronts, which line the sidewalk. In the distance, the headlights of cars, including classic black London taxis, cut through the darkness, while a traditional red postbox stands prominently in the foreground. The focus remains on the overall environment and moody atmosphere, with the camera moving steadily down the sidewalk to capture the scale and ambiance of the rainy urban setting rather than highlighting a specific subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
