    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, featuring a slow zoom towards the ornate facade of a magnificent, white marble basilica under a brilliant blue sky. The Gothic Revival architecture is characterized by its intricate carvings, pointed arches, a large central rose window, and a prominent Star of David set within the main pediment. There is no single main subject, as the shot is designed to immerse the viewer in the grandeur and architectural splendor of the location. The focus is on capturing the atmosphere and impressive scale of the building, making the environment itself the primary point of interest rather than any specific person or object within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
