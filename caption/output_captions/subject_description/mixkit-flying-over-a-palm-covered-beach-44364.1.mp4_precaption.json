    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot. There is no main subject because the focus is on the expansive environment and atmosphere, capturing the scale of the tropical coastline. The aerial perspective showcases the gentle waves of the ocean meeting a sandy beach, which is bordered by a dense forest of tall, green palm trees. In the distance, hazy, tree-covered hills stretch across the horizon under a pale, early morning or late afternoon sky, emphasizing the natural beauty and vastness of the location rather than a specific object or entity.",
