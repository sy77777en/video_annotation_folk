    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic maritime scenery shot from the high vantage point of a massive container ship navigating the open ocean. The perspective looks forward over stacks of red, blue, and dark-colored shipping containers, which lead the eye toward the vast, dark sea stretching to the horizon. A wide, expansive sky dominates the view, filled with a dynamic, time-lapsed layer of swirling grey and brownish-orange clouds, with the bright, hazy sun partially obscured. There is no single main subject; instead, the focus is on the immense scale of the environment and the atmospheric feeling of the journey, with the ship serving to contextualize the vastness of the sea and sky.",
