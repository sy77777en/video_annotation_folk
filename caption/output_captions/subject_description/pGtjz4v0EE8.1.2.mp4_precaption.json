    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a high-angle cityscape scenery shot showcasing the magnificent, intricately detailed facade of a grand cathedral. The building features elaborate carvings, multiple arched doorways, and a striking polychrome marble pattern of white, green, and pink. Below, a sun-drenched public square is bustling with numerous people, casting long shadows across the pavement. There is no single main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the impressive scale of the architecture and the lively atmosphere of the historic location, focusing on the overall environment rather than a specific object.",
