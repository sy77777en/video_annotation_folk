    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a view of London from the River Thames during what appears to be dawn or dusk. The scene is dominated by the grand, classical-style facade of County Hall on the riverbank, with a portion of the London Eye visible to the left. A white tour boat is moored near the bank as the water gently shimmers with reflected light, all cast in a warm, desaturated, sepia-toned palette. There is no single main subject; instead, the focus is on establishing the grand scale of the architecture and the tranquil, atmospheric mood of the city environment. The camera's slow zoom onto the building's repeating windows emphasizes the vastness of the structure rather than any specific detail.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
