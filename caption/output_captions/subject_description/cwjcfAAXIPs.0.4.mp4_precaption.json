    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an ethereal cityscape scenery shot, captured from a high aerial vantage point at sunrise. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on the majestic and atmospheric environment, emphasizing the grand scale of the scene. A dense layer of low-lying white fog blankets the urban landscape, creating a dreamlike sea of clouds from which buildings emerge. A prominent white monastery with a distinctive domed roof sits atop a hill, bathed in the warm, golden light of the rising sun, which glows brightly on the horizon. Parts of the surrounding city and distant hills are visible through and above the thick fog, adding depth to the serene and breathtaking view.",
