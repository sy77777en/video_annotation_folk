    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an underwater scenery shot. The focus is on the dark, mysterious deep-sea environment, characterized by deep blue water and floating white particles resembling marine snow. A large, elongated, dark object with a textured, reddish-brown upper surface and cracked, greyish sides lies partially buried in the sandy seabed. The dim, atmospheric lighting and the partial obscurity of the object emphasize the vastness and enigmatic nature of the underwater world rather than highlighting a specific, fully detailed subject.",
