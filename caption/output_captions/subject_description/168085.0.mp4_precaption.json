    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot featuring a breathtaking aerial view of a massive, flat-topped mountain, known as a tepui. Its surface is covered in vibrant green vegetation and is uniquely split by a central crevice from which a spectacular waterfall plunges into the deep, shadowed canyon below, with the surrounding vista filled with rolling green mountains fading into a hazy horizon. There is no main subject because the focus is on the immense scale and majestic beauty of the natural environment itself. The shot's purpose is to convey the awe-inspiring atmosphere of the location, with the unique geological formation and waterfall serving as the central elements of the composition.",
