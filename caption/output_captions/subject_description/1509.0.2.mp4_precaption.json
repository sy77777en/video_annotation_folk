    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject\u2019s type, using precise terms such as \u201cman,\u201d \u201cwoman,\u201d \u201cdog,\u201d \u201ccar,\u201d or \u201ctree,\u201d rather than vague words like \u201cthing\u201d or \u201citem.\u201d If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject\u2019s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as \u201cthe man,\u201d \u201cthe dog,\u201d or \u201cthe tree.\u201d If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., \u201cthe woman in the red dress,\u201d \u201cthe man with the beard\u201d), location within the scene (e.g., \u201cthe man on the left,\u201d \u201cthe car in the midground\u201d), actions (e.g., \u201cthe child playing with a ball,\u201d \u201cthe bird flying\u201d), or relationships to each other (e.g., \u201cthe man next to the woman,\u201d \u201cthe first man that enters the frame\u201d). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn\u2019t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nThis video contains one or more shot transitions. Please describe the subject of each segment in a single fluent paragraph.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features several individuals in a series of dramatic scenes. It begins with close-ups of a distressed woman with fair skin, dark hair styled up, red lipstick, and an earring, and a man with fair skin, reddish-brown hair, prominent sideburns, a mustache, and a goatee, wearing a white collar and dark jacket. A young man with dark hair and fair skin appears, first seen sitting on a bed with a woman in a pink robe, then in intense close-ups, and interacting closely with the distressed woman, who is crying. Another man with fair skin, blue eyes, and a mustache is shown looking upwards intensely. The young man is depicted being restrained and looking distressed, while the woman shouts. Subsequent rapid cuts show the young man falling amidst a crowd, a man with light brown hair and a mustache in formal wear, the woman being kissed on the neck, a struggle on the floor, energetic dancing by the woman (wearing a sparkly silver top and long white gloves) and another woman (in a red hat and costume), and overhead views of crowds and stage-like settings. Text overlays reading \"NO LAWS,\" \"NO LIMITS,\" \"ONLY ONE RULE,\" and \"NEVER FALL IN LOVE\" are displayed over some scenes.",
