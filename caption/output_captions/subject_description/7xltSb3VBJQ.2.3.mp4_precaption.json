Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a quiet urban street corner, focusing on the environment rather than a specific subject. The scene includes elements like a vending machine, bicycles, and residential buildings, emphasizing the everyday atmosphere of the neighborhood. The presence of a traffic light and a no-parking sign adds to the urban setting. The overall composition highlights the scale and layout of the street, creating a sense of place without focusing on any single object.",
