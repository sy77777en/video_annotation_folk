    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot of Venice, characterized by its focus on the overall urban environment and bustling atmosphere rather than a singular main subject. This is achieved as the view sweeps across a wide canal with choppy, grey-green water, bordered by continuous rows of historic Venetian buildings displaying reddish-brown and cream facades and tiled roofs. Various watercraft, notably a large, passenger-filled white and green public transport boat labeled \"Actv 26\" and adorned with \"LUOGO E SEGNI,\" alongside a smaller wooden motorboat, traverse the canal, contributing to the lively scene without becoming the sole point of interest. The presence of a grand, ornate white building with classical statues and a wide staircase populated by people further enriches the diverse visual elements, emphasizing that the shot captures the comprehensive scale and character of this iconic location under an overcast sky, rather than isolating one particular element.",
