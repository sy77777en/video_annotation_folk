    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a wide, sunlit street in a modern Japanese city. The view is from a clean, tiled sidewalk, looking down a multi-lane road where traffic, including a blue compact car and a silver van, flows smoothly. The street is lined with contemporary buildings, most notably a tall, beige hotel on the right, and is separated by a median strip with green trees under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. There is no main subject, as the static, wide perspective captures the overall atmosphere and scale of the urban environment, focusing on the peaceful, orderly rhythm of city life rather than any specific entity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
