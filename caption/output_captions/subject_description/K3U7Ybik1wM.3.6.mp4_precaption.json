    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot of a dimly lit attic bedroom, characterized by its rustic and cozy atmosphere. The video lacks a main subject, as the static, wide-angle view is intended to capture the overall environment and architectural character of the space. The room features a sloped white ceiling with exposed dark wooden beams and a large, central skylight that provides the main source of natural light, revealing a glimpse of green foliage outside. To the left, a bed with a black metal frame is softly illuminated by a warm bedside lamp. In the background, a wall of simple white closet doors stands opposite a small wooden desk and chair in the right foreground, creating a sense of a quiet, lived-in space.",
