Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot focusing on expansive rice paddies. The emphasis is on the environment and atmosphere, showcasing a patchwork of flooded fields with varying shades of green and brown. The paddies are neatly divided by narrow paths and irrigation channels, creating a geometric pattern. In the background, a dense line of trees and a misty horizon add depth, enhancing the sense of scale and tranquility. The absence of a main subject highlights the vastness and serene beauty of the rural landscape.",
