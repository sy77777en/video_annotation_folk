    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a broad aerial view of an urban area interspersed with patches of greenery and open fields. The scene features clusters of mid-rise apartment buildings, industrial structures, and a network of roads and railways, all set beneath a thick, overcast sky that casts a muted light over the landscape. The focus is on the expansive environment and the relationship between the built and natural elements, rather than on any specific object or individual, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere of the city as a whole rather than highlighting a main subject.",
