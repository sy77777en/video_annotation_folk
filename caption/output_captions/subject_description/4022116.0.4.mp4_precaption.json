    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot where the focus is on the architectural grandeur and atmosphere of a Venetian setting rather than a specific object or individual. The video showcases a magnificent, domed basilica constructed from light-colored stone, heavily adorned with statues and intricate carvings, featuring a wide staircase leading up to a large, dark green central door. To its right, a simpler building with a red-tiled roof is visible. In the foreground, dark gondolas are moored in the calm water at the foot of the stairs, while small figures of people on the steps and in the vicinity highlight the monumental scale of the main structure under an overcast sky. The camera's slight movement reinforces the environmental focus, capturing the overall splendor and context of the scene.",
