    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an aerial scenery shot of a computer-generated model depicting a large, sprawling industrial or military complex. There is no main subject, as the camera's slow pan across the scene emphasizes the vast scale and layout of the entire facility rather than any single element. The complex is situated in a flat, barren, brown landscape under a low sun that casts long shadows. It consists of numerous blocky, geometric buildings colored in muted shades of white, light green, and reddish-brown. A prominent reddish-brown perimeter wall encloses the core section, which contains several larger, more intricate structures, including a multi-level white building at the center and another with tower-like features nearby. The overall composition highlights the organized, yet extensive, nature of the isolated site.",
