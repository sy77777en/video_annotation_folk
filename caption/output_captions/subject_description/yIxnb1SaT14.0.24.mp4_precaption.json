    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, capturing a static, low-angle view of a grand, illuminated basilica at night. On the right side of the frame, the building's white stone facade, featuring intricate carvings, arched windows, and a domed tower, glows against the dark, cloudy sky. Positioned in front of the basilica is a large, verdigris-patinated equestrian statue, bathed in a cool, blue-green light, depicting a figure on horseback holding a cross. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the majestic architectural environment and the moody, reverent atmosphere created by the dramatic lighting and scale. The composition emphasizes the grandeur of the location rather than a specific object or character.",
