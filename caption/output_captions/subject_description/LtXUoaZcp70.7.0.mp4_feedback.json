    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject\u2019s type, using precise terms such as \u201cman,\u201d \u201cwoman,\u201d \u201cdog,\u201d \u201ccar,\u201d or \u201ctree,\u201d rather than vague words like \u201cthing\u201d or \u201citem.\u201d If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject\u2019s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as \u201cthe man,\u201d \u201cthe dog,\u201d or \u201cthe tree.\u201d If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., \u201cthe woman in the red dress,\u201d \u201cthe man with the beard\u201d), location within the scene (e.g., \u201cthe man on the left,\u201d \u201cthe car in the midground\u201d), actions (e.g., \u201cthe child playing with a ball,\u201d \u201cthe bird flying\u201d), or relationships to each other (e.g., \u201cthe man next to the woman,\u201d \u201cthe first man that enters the frame\u201d). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn\u2019t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",
