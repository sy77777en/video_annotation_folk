    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a resort scenery shot depicting a private outdoor patio. The scene features a modern concrete patio with dark wicker furniture, including a round, glass-topped table and lounge chairs with grey cushions, set against a low white wall. Beyond the patio lies a small area of sand and a dense backdrop of lush green tropical trees and plants, creating a secluded, natural ambiance. There is no main subject, as the camera's slow pan is intended to showcase the environment and atmosphere of the space. The focus is on conveying a sense of tranquility and the blend of modern comfort with nature, rather than on a specific person or object.",
