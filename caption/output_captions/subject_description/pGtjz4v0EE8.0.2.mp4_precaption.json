    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot that captures the architectural grandeur of a historic European building. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the impressive scale and intricate details of the environment itself. The building, set against a cloudless, deep blue sky, features multiple weathered grey domes and elaborate white marble facades adorned with gothic arches, pinnacles, and numerous statues. One of the domes is conspicuously encased in scaffolding, indicating ongoing restoration work, while the view slowly zooms in to highlight the detailed stonework and statuary crowning the central section.",
