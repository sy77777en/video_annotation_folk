    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a scenery shot of a modern RV park, capturing a specific campsite in detail. A large recreational vehicle with a beige, black, and white swooping design is parked on a grassy patch, shaded by a large tree. In front of it sits a raised patio area built with brown retaining wall blocks, furnished with a black grill, a small metal table and chairs, and two Adirondack chairs, creating an inviting outdoor living space. Further down the paved road, other RVs are parked in the distance under a bright, partly cloudy sky. There is no single main subject, as the camera's static position and wide composition are intended to convey the overall atmosphere and well-equipped nature of the campground. The focus is on the environment itself, establishing a sense of a peaceful and comfortable outdoor setting.",
