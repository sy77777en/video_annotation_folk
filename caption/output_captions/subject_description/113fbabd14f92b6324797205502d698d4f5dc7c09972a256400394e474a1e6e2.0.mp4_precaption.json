    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a coastal scenery shot that begins on a wide, flat expanse of dark sand before gliding forward over the gentle, lapping waves and out across the vast, calm surface of the grey-blue ocean. The sky above is filled with large, low-hanging white and grey clouds, with patches of blue visible between them. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is deliberately placed on the expansive scale and tranquil atmosphere of the natural environment. The shot's purpose is to immerse the viewer in the vastness of the sea and sky rather than to highlight a specific object or entity.",
