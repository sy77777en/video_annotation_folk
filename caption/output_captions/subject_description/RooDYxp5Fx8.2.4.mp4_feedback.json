    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a quiet urban street in Japan under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The camera pans slowly to the right, revealing a wide, paved sidewalk next to a multi-lane road spanned by a large, green pedestrian overpass with noticeably rusted stairs. On the left, modern buildings line the street, where a single person walks away from the camera, while a blue city bus stop sign stands on the right. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is instead on the overall environment and the tranquil, sunny atmosphere of the urban landscape, emphasizing the scale of the street and architecture over any single element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
