    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful supercell thunderstorm moving across a vast, flat plain. The sky is filled with a massive, swirling formation of dark grey and white storm clouds, with a lower, menacing shelf cloud from which curtains of heavy rain can be seen falling in the distance. Below, a wide expanse of green and yellow grassland stretches uninterrupted to the horizon, emphasizing the immense scale of the weather system. There is no main subject because the composition's focus is on capturing the raw power and atmospheric drama of the storm itself, dwarfing the landscape below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
