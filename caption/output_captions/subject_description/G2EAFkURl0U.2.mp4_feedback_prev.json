    "pre_caption": "This video presents a tranquil campground scenery shot, capturing a well-appointed RV site on a partly cloudy day. The scene is centered on a large, modern recreational vehicle, decorated with sweeping graphics in shades of brown, cream, and black, parked under the shade of leafy green trees. In front of the RV, a raised patio area, enclosed by a low, curved retaining wall of reddish-brown blocks, is furnished with a black grill, a small table and chairs, and a couple of Adirondack chairs, creating an inviting outdoor living space. The camera remains stationary, establishing a sense of place and atmosphere rather than focusing on a single subject. This wide, static composition allows the viewer to take in the entire environment, from the details of the campsite to the other RVs visible down the paved road, emphasizing the overall setting of the RV park.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
