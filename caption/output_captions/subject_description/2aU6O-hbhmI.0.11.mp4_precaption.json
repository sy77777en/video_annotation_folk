Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a sprawling urban environment at sunset, with a focus on the skyline and the interplay of natural and artificial light. The scene includes numerous high-rise buildings, construction cranes, and a vibrant sky transitioning from day to night. The emphasis is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the city rather than any specific object, highlighting the dynamic and expansive nature of the urban landscape.",
