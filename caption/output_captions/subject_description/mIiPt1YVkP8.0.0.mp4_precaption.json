    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, aerial scenery shot of a sprawling airport complex at night, with the focus on the vast scale and intricate layout of the infrastructure rather than a specific subject. The dark landscape is illuminated by a complex grid of glowing green and white lights that delineate the multiple intersecting runways and taxiways. In the lower right portion of the frame, a large, brightly lit circular terminal building is visible, with several concourses extending from it. A white text overlay in the center of the image reads \"July 7, 2017\".",
