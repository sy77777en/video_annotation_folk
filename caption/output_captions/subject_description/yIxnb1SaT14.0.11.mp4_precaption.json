    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot focused on the top of a grand, classical monument illuminated against a dark night sky. The central feature is a magnificent quadriga sculpture, where a gleaming golden figure of a woman stands in a chariot, guiding four rearing horses of a striking teal or verdigris patina. Flanking this centerpiece are other stone statues of what appear to be soldiers, and the facade below is adorned with intricate bas-relief carvings and a large inscription. There is no main subject in the traditional sense, as the camera's static gaze is fixed on the architectural element itself, emphasizing the majestic scale and dramatic lighting of the structure to create a powerful, atmospheric scene.",
