    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic cityscape scenery shot featuring the London Eye, a massive white Ferris wheel, set against a sky filled with heavy, dark clouds. The wheel is positioned over the dark, rippling waters of the River Thames, which occupies the foreground along with a large barge. In the background, a mix of modern skyscrapers and older, classical-style buildings line the riverbank, with a small airplane visible in the sky. The shot intentionally lacks a single main subject, as the wide composition and moody, desaturated color palette are used to convey the grand scale and somber atmosphere of the urban environment rather than focusing on a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
