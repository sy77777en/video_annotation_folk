    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban environment at night. The scene features a grand, ornately decorated fountain with intricate sculptures and golden accents, illuminated by artificial lighting that highlights its architectural details. In the background, a large Ferris wheel adorned with colorful lights adds a dynamic and festive atmosphere, while the night sky and scattered clouds contribute to the overall ambiance. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is on the interplay of architectural elements, lighting, and the lively city atmosphere rather than any specific object or individual. The emphasis is on the environment and the sense of scale and vibrancy within the urban setting.",
