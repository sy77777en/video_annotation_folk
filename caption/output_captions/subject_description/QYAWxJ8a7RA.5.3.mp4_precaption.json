    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a high-angle, static scenery shot of a miniature model depicting a small, isolated town in a barren, sandy desert landscape. The pockmarked and uneven terrain is crisscrossed by a network of dark, drawn roads, arranged in both a grid and curving loops, which connect numerous simple, white, block-like buildings. Several of these structures are marked with small patches of red, adding a subtle, ominous detail to the scene. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish the setting and convey a sense of scale and desolation, focusing on the environment as a whole rather than any individual element.",
