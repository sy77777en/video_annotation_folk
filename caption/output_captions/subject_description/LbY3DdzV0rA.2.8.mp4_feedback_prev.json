    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot of a desert environment under a turbulent sky. The composition lacks a single main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural environment. A massive, dark purple and grey storm cloud dominates the frame, appearing to swirl and advance in a time-lapse motion, with visible sheets of rain falling in the distance on the left. In stark contrast, the right side of the sky reveals patches of pale blue and soft, light-colored clouds, suggesting the scene is set during sunrise or sunset. The foreground is a vast, arid plain dotted with sparse desert scrub, leading back to a silhouette of dark mountains on the distant horizon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
