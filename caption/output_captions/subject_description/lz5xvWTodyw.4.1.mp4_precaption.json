    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an expansive, aerial cityscape scenery shot of a stylized Paris, identifiable by the iconic Eiffel Tower in the background and dense blocks of Haussmann-style buildings. A massive, vibrant red roller coaster track intricately weaves throughout the urban environment, looping over streets and around buildings, with multiple white and red coaster trains visible along its length. There is no single main subject, as the camera's high-angle, sweeping view is designed to capture the grand scale and surreal atmosphere of the entire scene. The focus is on the juxtaposition of the historic city and the sprawling amusement ride, creating a unique and fantastical landscape.",
