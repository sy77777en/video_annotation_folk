Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a dynamic road scenery shot. It captures the essence of movement and transition, focusing on the environment rather than a specific subject. The first part of the video shows an open highway with a wide sky, featuring a sunset with vibrant clouds, emphasizing the vastness and openness of the road. The second part transitions to a more enclosed, tree-lined street, with blurred lights suggesting speed and motion. The focus is on the atmosphere and the experience of travel, highlighting the contrast between open and enclosed spaces, rather than any particular object.",
