    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot from the perspective of a vehicle driving down a multi-lane road at night. The scene is dark, illuminated primarily by red traffic lights, the headlights of distant cars, and a bright overhead streetlight that creates a prominent lens flare. A large semi-truck with a slatted trailer travels alongside the camera on the right, while on the left, a building is distinguished by its vibrant purple and green neon lighting. There is no main subject because the focus is on capturing the overall atmosphere and environment of an urban night drive; the moving point-of-view and wide perspective are used to convey a sense of place rather than to highlight a specific person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
