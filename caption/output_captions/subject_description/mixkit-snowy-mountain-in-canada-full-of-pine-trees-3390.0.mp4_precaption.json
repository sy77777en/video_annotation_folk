    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a majestic aerial landscape scenery shot of a winter mountain range. The composition is dominated by a snow-blanketed mountain ridge in the foreground, its slopes thick with frosted evergreen trees and crowned by a rugged, rocky bluff. Below and beyond, a vast sea of white clouds fills the valleys, with the sharp, snow-capped peaks of a more distant mountain range piercing through them against a pale blue sky. There is no single main subject, as the shot's expansive perspective is intended to capture the immense scale and serene, high-altitude atmosphere of the alpine environment itself.",
