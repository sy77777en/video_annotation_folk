    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a high-angle view of a wide river flowing through an urban environment. A prominent, reddish-brown truss bridge with a distinctive stone bridge tender house spans the water, occupied by a convoy of tan-colored military tanks. Below, the river is busy with civilian life, featuring a bright orange, open-top tour boat filled with passengers, a larger white tour boat, and other smaller vessels. There is no single main subject, as the composition is designed to establish the environment and a specific atmosphere. The focus is on the juxtaposition of ordinary city activity with an imposing military presence, emphasizing the scale of the event rather than any individual element.",
