    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot capturing a walkthrough of a magnificent and ornate gallery. The camera moves forward down the long hall, showcasing a spectacular barrel-vaulted ceiling covered in intricate frescoes with gold and blue accents. The walls are lined with decorative panels and paintings, and bright light streams in from large windows along one side. The primary focus is on the grandeur and artistic detail of the architecture rather than any individual person or object. The presence of other visitors simply adds to the sense of scale and the atmosphere of a historic public space. The use of a wide-angle lens further emphasizes the immersive quality and vastness of the hall.",
