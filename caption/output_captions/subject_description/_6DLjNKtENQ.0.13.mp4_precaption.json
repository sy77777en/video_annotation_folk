    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a high-angle cityscape scenery shot, establishing a location and atmosphere of conflict. The focus is on the overall environment and scale rather than a specific subject, using the wide perspective to convey the scope of the event. The scene captures a brown metal bascule bridge, identified by a \"FRANKLIN STREET\" sign, with several military tanks parked along its span. Below, a double-decker tour boat and a smaller speedboat move through the dark river water. The background features modern city buildings, a grassy riverbank, an empty dirt lot, and a large splash erupting in the water near what appears to be a pile of ice on the shore.",
