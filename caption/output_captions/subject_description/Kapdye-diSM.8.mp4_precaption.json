    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a quiet, upscale street in a European city. The narrow road is flanked by grand, historic buildings with ornate stone facades and rows of windows, creating an atmosphere of affluence and architectural heritage. Several luxury cars are parked along the street, including a black Porsche Cayenne in the foreground, a red sports car, a grey Bentley with the license plate \"BY05 NDO,\" and a white BMW X1, alongside a white van and a few green trees. There is no main subject, as the shot is designed to capture the overall environment and atmosphere. The focus is on conveying the character and scale of the opulent urban setting rather than singling out any particular object or person.",
