    "pre_caption": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a sterile, minimalist interior. A wide, curving staircase, covered entirely in small white tiles, descends into a circular space defined by large, plain white pillars and a matching tiled wall. A simple metal handrail follows the curve of the stairs, which lead down towards a dark, teal-colored void or pool of water. The scene is bathed in a diffuse, slightly greenish light, creating a clean yet unsettling atmosphere. The video lacks a traditional main subject, as the focus is placed entirely on the liminal and surreal quality of the architecture itself, emphasizing the environment's scale and mood over any specific object or character.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
