    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a dynamic cityscape scenery shot captured from a fast-moving, downward-tilting perspective. The video follows a rapid descent alongside a modern, multi-story residential building with numerous glass balconies, set against a dramatic sunset sky filled with orange light on the horizon and dark clouds above. In the background, another high-rise is visible under construction, complete with a crane, while the ground level reveals a construction site and other illuminated urban structures. There is no main subject because the wide, vertiginous FPV-style shot is intended to capture the overall atmosphere, scale, and energy of the urban environment rather than focusing on a specific person or object.",
