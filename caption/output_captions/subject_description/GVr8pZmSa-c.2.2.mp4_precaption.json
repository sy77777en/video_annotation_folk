    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a static close-up of a small, stone-like object on a reddish surface. Then, a figure in a dark suit with crossed arms appears in the background, initially out of focus, before gradually coming into sharper focus. Finally, the figure's head and facial features, including light hair, glasses, and a mustache, become visible as the camera seems to adjust or the figure fully materializes.",
