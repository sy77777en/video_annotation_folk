    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm at night. The focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the weather event rather than a specific subject. The scene is set against a dark, flat horizon punctuated by the distant, twinkling lights of a city. Above, a vast and ominous storm cloud, initially cloaked in darkness, is suddenly and spectacularly illuminated from within by a massive lightning strike, causing a large portion of the sky to erupt in a brilliant, glowing purple. Within this vibrant luminescence, the turbulent, streaked texture of the cloud becomes visible, along with the bright, branching form of the lightning bolt itself.",
