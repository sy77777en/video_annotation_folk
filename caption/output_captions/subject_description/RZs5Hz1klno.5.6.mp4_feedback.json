    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot that captures a rapid, low-altitude fly-over of a vast, arid plain under a dusky pink sky. The focus is on conveying the scale and atmosphere of the desolate environment rather than highlighting a specific subject. The terrain consists of rolling, dark-earthed hills with sparse, scrubby vegetation, and a winding dirt road cuts through the landscape toward the horizon. In the distance, a series of large, white, dome-shaped structures, possibly a research or military installation, are visible, with a few dark military-style trucks briefly seen on the road leading to them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
