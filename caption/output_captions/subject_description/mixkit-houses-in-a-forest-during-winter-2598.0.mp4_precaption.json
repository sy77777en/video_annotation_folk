Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a serene winter environment with snow-covered trees, rustic wooden buildings, and majestic mountains in the background. The focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the natural setting rather than any specific object. The snow blankets the ground and trees, creating a tranquil and cohesive scene that emphasizes the beauty and vastness of the landscape. The presence of the mountains adds depth and grandeur, while the buildings blend into the environment, enhancing the sense of harmony with nature.",
