    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot of a dimly lit, opulent room at night. A strong beam of cool blue light emanates from a window on the left, illuminating a vanity table laden with a crystal decanter, a small golden box, and scattered papers. An ornate, gilded mirror sits on the table, reflecting the faint light, while a tall, slender statuette stands beside the window. The view outside the window reveals a dark sky with a glowing, web-like energy pattern. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is on establishing a mysterious and quiet atmosphere, using the environment and lighting to set a specific mood rather than highlighting a particular object or character.",
