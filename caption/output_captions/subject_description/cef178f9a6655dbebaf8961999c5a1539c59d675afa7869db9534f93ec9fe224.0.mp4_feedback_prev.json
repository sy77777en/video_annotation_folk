    "pre_caption": "This video is a low-angle cityscape scenery shot looking down a wide, paved street flanked by grand, multi-story buildings with classical architectural details. Under a bright blue sky, a Union Jack flag flies from a building on the right, and a large archway is visible in the distance, while a steady stream of traffic, including black cabs, a red double-decker bus, and other cars, moves away from the camera. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the grand scale of the urban environment and the dynamic atmosphere of city life. The low perspective emphasizes the height of the buildings and the expanse of the street, immersing the viewer in the scene. The shot is designed to convey a sense of place rather than to follow a specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
