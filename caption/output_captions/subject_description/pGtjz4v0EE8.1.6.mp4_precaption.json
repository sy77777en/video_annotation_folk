    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot centered on the grand Altar of the Fatherland monument in Rome. The immense, white neoclassical building features a wide central staircase, a large colonnade, and is crowned by two prominent bronze quadrigas on its roofline, all set against a blue sky with scattered white clouds. An equestrian statue stands at the monument's center, and two large Italian flags on tall poles flank the main structure. The composition lacks a single main subject, instead emphasizing the architectural grandeur and the bustling atmosphere of the surrounding piazza, which includes traffic, pedestrians, and colorful flowerbeds in the foreground.",
