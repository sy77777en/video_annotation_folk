    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot of a sterile, minimalist interior. The space is defined by white tiled floors and walls, with the lower portion of the walls finished in a contrasting dark, textured material. A prominent curved wall features a series of tall, capsule-shaped windows that glow with a bright, diffuse white light, illuminating the empty room. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the stark, clean geometry and liminal atmosphere of the environment itself. The composition emphasizes the architectural lines and play of light rather than a specific focal point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
