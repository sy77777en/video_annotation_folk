Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a vibrant urban street scene, focusing on the lively atmosphere and architectural elements rather than a specific subject. The environment is characterized by colorful storefronts, bright signage, and a bustling street with people walking and engaging in daily activities. The emphasis is on the dynamic and energetic feel of the city, highlighting the blend of modern and traditional elements in the urban landscape.",
