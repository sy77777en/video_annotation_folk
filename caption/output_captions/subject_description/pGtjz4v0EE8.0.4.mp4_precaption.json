    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot of a lavishly decorated, multi-tiered opera house. The architecture is overwhelmingly opulent, with curved balconies adorned in gold leaf, intricate carvings, and numerous glowing light fixtures. Each tier of seating boxes features painted medallions and decorative elements, all contributing to a sense of historical grandeur, with a particularly ornate royal box draped in rich, dark red velvet curtains at the center. There is no main subject in the video, as the shot is designed to capture the magnificent atmosphere and architectural scale of the entire auditorium. The focus is on the environment itself, emphasizing its opulence rather than any single person or object.",
