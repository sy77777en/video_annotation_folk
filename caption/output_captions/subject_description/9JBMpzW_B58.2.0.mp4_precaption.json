    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic seascape scenery shot, captured in a time-lapse from the bow of a massive container ship. The focus is not on a specific subject but rather on the immense scale of the natural environment and the feeling of a journey across the open water. The ship, with its stacks of blue, red, and beige containers filling the foreground, serves as a static viewpoint against the dynamic scene. Above, the deep blue sky is filled with clouds that streak and billow rapidly, their motion accelerated to create a powerful sense of passing time, while the vast, smooth ocean stretches out to a hazy horizon.",
