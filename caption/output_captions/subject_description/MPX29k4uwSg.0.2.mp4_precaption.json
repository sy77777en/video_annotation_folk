    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a rural scenery shot depicting a weathered, wooden barn with a dark, shingled gambrel roof set against a flat, white, overcast sky. The entire landscape is blanketed in thick snow, with a smaller, attached section of the barn also topped with a layer of white. To the right of the main structure, a rustic wooden corral stands partially visible. The scene is framed by two out-of-focus tree trunks in the foreground\u2014a birch tree on the left and a darker, rough-barked tree on the right\u2014which directs the viewer's gaze toward the barn. There is no single main subject, as the framing and the stark, monochromatic environment create a composition focused on conveying a sense of quiet, cold desolation and the stillness of a winter's day.",
