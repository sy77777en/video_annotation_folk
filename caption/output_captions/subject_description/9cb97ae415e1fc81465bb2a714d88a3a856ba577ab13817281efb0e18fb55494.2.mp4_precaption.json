    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot capturing a serene park setting. The focus is on the expansive green lawn, dotted with a few bare trees, suggesting a late autumn or early spring atmosphere. The golden sunlight casts long shadows, adding depth and warmth to the scene. In the background, a road with passing vehicles and a few buildings are visible, but they remain secondary to the natural elements. The emphasis is on the environment and the tranquil atmosphere it creates, rather than any specific object or subject.",
