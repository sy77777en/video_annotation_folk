    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a liminal space scenery shot of a room partially submerged in dark, murky water. The walls are lined with a grid of small, pale green tiles, all bathed in a dim, unsettling greenish-yellow light. Emerging from the gently rippling surface of the water is the top of a dark, arched opening in the back wall, its interior shrouded in complete blackness. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish a mysterious and eerie atmosphere. The low camera angle, positioned at the water's surface, immerses the viewer in the strange environment rather than focusing on any specific object.",
