    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot, capturing a picturesque view of the Italian countryside. Rolling green hills, patterned with what appear to be vineyards and dotted with lush trees, stretch across the foreground under a vast blue sky with scattered white clouds. Perched atop a distant hill is a historic walled town, its skyline uniquely defined by a cluster of tall, slender stone towers. There is no single main subject, as the composition is designed to convey the expansive scale and tranquil atmosphere of the entire scene, emphasizing the harmonious relationship between the natural landscape and the ancient settlement.",
