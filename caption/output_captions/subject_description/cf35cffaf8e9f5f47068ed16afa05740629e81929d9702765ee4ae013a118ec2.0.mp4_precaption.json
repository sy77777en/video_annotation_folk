    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot capturing a vast, open expanse of rolling hills and rocky outcrops under a wide, expansive sky. The terrain is covered with dry grass, and scattered rocks add texture to the scene, while a herd of cattle grazes peacefully, blending into the natural environment. The distant hills create a sense of depth and scale, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape. The focus is on the serene atmosphere and the expansive environment rather than any specific object, highlighting the harmony between the land and the sky, and the tranquil coexistence of nature and wildlife.",
