    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot viewed from inside a building, looking out over a metropolitan area at dusk. In the foreground, the dark silhouettes of a person's head and a leafy plant frame the view through a window. The midground features a dark skyline of buildings and construction cranes against the fading light of the horizon. The most prominent feature is the dramatic, ominous sky, filled with dark, swirling clouds and large, ethereal formations of pink and white light that resemble ghostly apparitions or energy fields, with small, dark particles like ash floating in the air. The video lacks a single main subject, as the focus is on establishing a mysterious and unsettling atmosphere. The composition emphasizes the grand scale of the strange celestial event, making the environment itself the central point of interest rather than any specific character or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
