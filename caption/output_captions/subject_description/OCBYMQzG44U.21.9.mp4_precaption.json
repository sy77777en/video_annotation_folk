    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior architectural scenery shot, characterized by its clean, minimalist, and somewhat surreal aesthetic. It depicts a white, tiled environment, initially showing a spiral staircase with a metal railing descending into a pool of light green water, surrounded by white columns with dark green bases. A small, indistinct orange object is briefly visible in the water at the foot of the stairs. The scene then transitions to another area with white tiled floors and walls, the latter featuring a band of dark grey textured material and several tall, narrow, rounded windows emitting bright light. There is no main subject because the focus is on the overall architectural design, the sterile yet intriguing atmosphere, and the interplay of light and shadow within these spaces, rather than on any particular entity or object.",
