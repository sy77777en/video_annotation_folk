    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot of a tropical coastline at either sunrise or sunset. A bright sun hangs low on the horizon, its golden light reflecting across the calm, blue-green ocean and illuminating scattered, pink-tinged clouds against a soft blue sky. In the distance, a mountainous coastline recedes into the haze, while a few small, dark islets dot the water. The composition lacks a central subject, instead emphasizing the grand scale and tranquil atmosphere of the natural setting, with the interplay of light and color creating the primary visual focus.",
