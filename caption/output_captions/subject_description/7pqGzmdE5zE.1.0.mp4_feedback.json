    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static architectural scenery shot of a multi-story, white-walled building against a dark night sky. There is no main subject, as the composition emphasizes the building's structure and the quiet, nocturnal atmosphere. The facade is characterized by a mix of rectangular and arched windows, with a prominent black metal fire escape running down the center. A few windows are illuminated with a warm, interior light, while a streetlamp casts a brighter, cooler light across the building, creating distinct shadows and highlighting its textures. In the background, the silhouettes of tall palm trees are visible, reinforcing the urban setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
