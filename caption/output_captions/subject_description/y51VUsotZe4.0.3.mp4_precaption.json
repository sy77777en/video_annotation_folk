    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a top-down aerial cityscape scenery shot at night, capturing the sprawling urban environment from a high vantage point. The scene is dominated by the dark silhouettes of skyscrapers and the glowing grid of streets below, where the headlights and taillights of cars create streams of moving light. One building features a brightly lit roof with a distinct pattern of lights, while another towering skyscraper is illuminated from below, its structured, lit spire becoming increasingly prominent. There is no main subject, as the camera's detached, bird's-eye perspective emphasizes the vast scale and intricate patterns of the metropolis, focusing on the overall atmosphere of the nocturnal city rather than any individual element.",
