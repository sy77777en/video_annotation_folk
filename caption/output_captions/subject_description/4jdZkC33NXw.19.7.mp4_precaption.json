    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video captures a quiet, suburban streetscape scenery shot in Japan on a rainy, overcast day. The camera pans across a wet asphalt road flanked by modern Japanese homes and a commercial building, featuring a mix of white stucco walls and dark, angled roofs. Abundant, vibrant greenery, including trees, manicured hedges, and lush flowerbeds with bright yellow and purple blossoms, glistens from the rain. A prominent palm tree stands near one of the buildings, while numerous utility poles with a web of wires and a large, netted structure, likely a driving range, are visible in the background. The scene lacks a single main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall tranquil atmosphere and the meticulously landscaped environment of the neighborhood.",
