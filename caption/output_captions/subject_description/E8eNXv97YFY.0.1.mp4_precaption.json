    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, capturing a striking contrast between traditional and modern architecture under a dramatic, partly cloudy sky. The scene is set in a large, cobblestone plaza featuring an ornate, white stone monument with a pointed spire and intricate carvings. Towering in the background is a modern glass skyscraper, still under construction with a crane visible at its peak. The video lacks a single main subject; instead, the camera's upward tilting motion emphasizes the environment itself. This movement highlights the juxtaposition and scale difference between the historic monument and the towering new development, capturing the atmosphere of a rapidly evolving urban landscape.",
