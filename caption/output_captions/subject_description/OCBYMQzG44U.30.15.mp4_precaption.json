    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior architectural scenery shot, focusing on the environment and atmosphere of a stark, modern space. The camera pulls back to reveal a room with white tiled floors and walls, contrasted by sections of rough, grey textured walls and a dark, possibly water-filled, rectangular area recessed into the floor. An arched doorway with a dark interior stands at the far end. The scene is illuminated by a large circular ceiling light and smaller spotlights, creating a somewhat dim and sterile ambiance. There is no main subject, as the intention is to showcase the architectural design, the interplay of light and shadow, and the overall mood of the space, emphasizing its scale and minimalist aesthetic rather than a particular focal point.",
