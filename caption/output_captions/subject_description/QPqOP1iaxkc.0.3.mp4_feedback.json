    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot viewed through the diamond-patterned mesh of a chain-link fence, which occupies the foreground. Below, cars travel along a multi-lane highway, while in the background, another bridge or overpass crosses above the road, with buildings visible beyond it. There is no main subject in this video; the composition, framed by the fence, emphasizes the layered, industrial atmosphere of the urban environment. The focus is on the overall scene and its sense of scale rather than any individual element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
