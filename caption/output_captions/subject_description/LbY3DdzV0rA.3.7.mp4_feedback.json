    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot captured at night. The focus is not on a singular subject but rather on the awe-inspiring atmosphere and the immense scale of the natural spectacle unfolding. The composition emphasizes the powerful contrast between the raw energy of nature and the persistent, linear motion of human activity. A dark, stormy sky, tinged with deep purple and orange hues, dominates the frame as brilliant, forked lightning bolts repeatedly flash and strike down toward the distant horizon. Below, a highway cuts through the darkened terrain, its path defined by the continuous, glowing light trails of vehicles: bright white and yellow streaks from approaching headlights on the left, and parallel red streaks from receding taillights on the right, all converging toward the storm in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
