    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot from an elevated perspective, capturing a historic European square as it transitions from bright daylight to illuminated night. The focus is not on a singular subject but rather on the grand architectural ensemble and the evolving atmosphere of the urban space, emphasizing the scale and timelessness of the structures. Central to the view is an octagonal baptistery, distinguished by its white and green marble striped facade, arched windows, and pyramidal roof, standing adjacent to a partially visible, elaborately decorated cathedral with a prominent bell tower. The paved square below teems with people during the day, their movements transforming into blurred streaks under the artificial glow of streetlights and building illuminations at night, conveying a sense of continuous activity against the backdrop of enduring historical architecture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
