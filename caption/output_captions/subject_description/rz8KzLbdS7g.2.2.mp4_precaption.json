Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is an urban scenery shot. It captures a narrow street flanked by buildings with a traditional house in the background. The focus is on the environment, highlighting the architectural details like the red-tiled roof and wooden elements of the house. The street is bordered by a concrete wall adorned with posters, and greenery adds a touch of nature. The emphasis is on the atmosphere and setting, rather than a specific object, showcasing the blend of urban and traditional elements.",
