Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a quiet residential street lined with modern houses and parked cars. The focus is on the environment, showcasing the architecture, street layout, and urban atmosphere rather than any specific object. The presence of utility poles, street signs, and greenery adds to the sense of everyday life in a suburban setting, emphasizing the scale and ambiance of the neighborhood.",
