    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a desolate, rural scenery shot, capturing a low-angle perspective of an empty street in a snow-covered town at sunrise or sunset. Simple, silhouetted buildings, including a two-story house and a central tower, line the road against a backdrop of rolling hills. A large, brilliant sun hangs low in the sky, casting a warm, hazy glow and causing the textured pavement in the foreground to sparkle, while small, dark particles drift down through the air. There is no main subject, as the composition intentionally emphasizes the overall mood and environment; the low camera angle and shallow depth of field draw attention to the texture of the ground and the stark, atmospheric lighting rather than any specific building or character.",
