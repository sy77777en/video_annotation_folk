    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a dramatic weather event over a flat, open plain. The video's focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific object, emphasizing the immense scale of the natural phenomenon. A massive, dark, and turbulent supercell storm cloud dominates the sky, appearing to rotate slowly as it looms over the landscape. A dense, grey curtain of heavy precipitation falls from the base of the storm, connecting the dark clouds to the distant horizon. The ground is a vast, brownish-yellow field that stretches out flatly, while a sliver of brighter, yellowish light is visible on the horizon to the right, contrasting sharply with the ominous darkness of the storm.",
