    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a remote, snow-covered location under a starry night sky. Vibrant green ribbons of the aurora borealis dance and shift across the deep blue expanse, forming ethereal curtains of light. In the foreground, a thick blanket of snow covers the ground, leading up to a line of dark evergreen trees and a small, white, functional-looking building with satellite dishes and antennas on its roof. The video lacks a single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the vast, atmospheric beauty of the arctic night. The focus is on the interplay between the natural wonder of the aurora and the isolated human structure, creating a sense of scale and wonder.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
