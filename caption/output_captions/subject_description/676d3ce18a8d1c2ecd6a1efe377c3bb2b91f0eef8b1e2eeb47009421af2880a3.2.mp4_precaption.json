Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures an aerial view of a church surrounded by a mix of lush greenery and harvested fields. The focus is on the environment, highlighting the contrast between the vibrant green trees and the golden-brown fields. The church, with its tall spire and stone architecture, blends into the landscape, emphasizing the harmony between human-made structures and nature. The overall atmosphere is serene and expansive, with no single main subject dominating the scene.",
