    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a massive, turbulent storm system moving across a vast, flat prairie. The sky is dominated by a swirling, layered supercell cloud, with dark, ominous gray and teal tones contrasting with brighter white sections above. Sheets of rain are visible falling in the distance, partially obscuring a sliver of golden light on the far horizon. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and powerful atmosphere of the weather phenomenon itself, dwarfing the expansive, grassy landscape below.",
