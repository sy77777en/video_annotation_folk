    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic seascape scenery shot capturing a powerful ocean scene. Turbulent, turquoise waves with white foamy crests crash violently against large, dark, rugged sea stacks and a towering cliff face under a clear, light-blue sky. A flock of birds flies in a loose formation across the upper portion of the frame, adding a sense of life to the vast landscape. The video does not have a single main subject, as the focus is on conveying the immense scale and raw, untamed atmosphere of the coastal environment. The composition emphasizes the powerful interplay between the sea and the land rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
