    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot of London on a clear day. The view is from a stone embankment along the River Thames, looking towards the iconic Tower Bridge, whose two grand towers and blue suspension cables dominate the center of the frame. To the left, the historic Tower of London is visible on the far bank. The composition lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to capture the expansive scale and atmosphere of this famous urban landscape, focusing on the relationship between the architectural landmarks and the river rather than any individual element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
