Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is an urban cityscape scenery shot. It captures the dynamic and expansive view of a construction site within a city environment. The focus is on the scale and complexity of the urban landscape, highlighting the intricate network of cranes, buildings, and construction materials. The sweeping angles and vibrant colors emphasize the bustling atmosphere and the ongoing development, rather than concentrating on a specific object or subject. The emphasis is on the environment and the sense of movement and progress within the city.",
