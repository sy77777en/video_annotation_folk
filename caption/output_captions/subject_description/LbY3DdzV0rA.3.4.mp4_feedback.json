    "pre_caption": "This video is a dramatic time-lapse landscape scenery shot, where the focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific main subject. A massive storm system dominates the frame, with its bright, sunlit white tops contrasting against a dark, menacing grey underbelly that churns and expands across the sky. A concentrated shaft of heavy rain visibly descends from the cloud base onto the vast, arid plain below, which is colored in shades of yellow and green with sparse vegetation. In the far distance, a faint mountain range sits on the horizon, and a paved road cuts through the landscape on the right, further emphasizing the sheer size of the powerful weather event.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
