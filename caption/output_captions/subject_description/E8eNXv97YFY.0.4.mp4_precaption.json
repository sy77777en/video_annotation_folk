    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide cityscape scenery shot of a large, open-air stadium. A vibrant green grass field, where a few small figures can be seen, is encircled by a reddish-brown and grey running track. The expansive, tiered concrete stands are largely empty, with one section covered by a prominent roof structure, and the city skyline is visible in the background under a partly cloudy sky. The video lacks a main subject, as the high-angle, wide perspective emphasizes the scale and atmosphere of the venue itself rather than any specific activity or individual within it.",
