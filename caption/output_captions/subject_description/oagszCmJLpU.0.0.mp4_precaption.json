    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot dominated by a colossal and ominous storm system. Dark, turbulent grey and black clouds churn across the sky, with a prominent, low-hanging white shelf cloud stretching across the middle, suggesting an approaching severe weather event. Below this menacing sky, a vast, flat field of vibrant yellow flowers extends to the horizon, where a small cluster of distant trees and buildings is dwarfed by the immense scale of the cloud formation. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on capturing the powerful, foreboding atmosphere and the overwhelming scale of the natural environment.",
