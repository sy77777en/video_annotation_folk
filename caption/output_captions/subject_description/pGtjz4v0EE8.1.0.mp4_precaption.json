    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot presenting a dramatic, wide-angle, time-lapse view of the Colosseum in Rome at night. The ancient amphitheater is bathed in a warm, golden-orange glow, highlighting its tiered structure of arches and weathered stone against the dark sky. Streaks of white and red light from passing vehicles blur across the foreground, creating a sense of motion and energy. The video lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to convey the majestic scale and atmospheric ambiance of the iconic landmark within its bustling, modern environment, contrasting the enduring stone with the fleeting lights of the city.",
