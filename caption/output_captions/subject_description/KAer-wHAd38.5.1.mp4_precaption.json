Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a rural road leading to a bridge, surrounded by lush greenery and a vibrant blue sky filled with scattered, fluffy clouds. The focus is on the expansive environment, highlighting the open road, the natural elements, and the serene atmosphere rather than any specific object. The presence of trees, a distant building with a red roof, and the bridge structure contribute to the sense of scale and tranquility, emphasizing the beauty of the natural and built environment in harmony.",
