Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a coastal area with a prominent lighthouse surrounded by greenery, rocky shores, and expansive water. The focus is on the vastness and natural beauty of the environment, highlighting the contrast between the land and sea. The lighthouse, while visually striking, is part of the broader landscape, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere rather than a specific object. The video conveys a sense of tranquility and openness, with the horizon stretching into the distance.",
