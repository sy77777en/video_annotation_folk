    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior scenery shot, offering a panoramic tour of a furnished yurt. The absence of a singular main subject allows the focus to rest on the overall environment, layout, and cozy atmosphere of the accommodation. The yurt's distinctive circular structure is evident, with its conical roof supported by radiating wooden beams and characteristic lattice walls. Key furnishings visible include a double bed adorned with patterned, festive bedding and decorative pillows, a grey sofa, a blue chest of drawers, a compact wooden kitchenette area complete with stools and a mini-fridge, a blue armchair with a furry throw, and a tall wooden cabinet. A fluffy grey rug on the dark floor and various small decorative items, including Christmas-themed gnomes, enhance the rustic and inviting feel of the space, which is illuminated by a mix of natural and artificial light, with wall-mounted electric heaters also visible.",
