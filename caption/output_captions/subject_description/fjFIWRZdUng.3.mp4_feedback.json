    "pre_caption": "This is a naval battle scenery shot depicting a chaotic engagement at sea under a dark, overcast sky. In the foreground, a modern gray destroyer is seen at a dramatic angle, with flames and thick black smoke billowing from its superstructure. Further in the distance, the large silhouette of an aircraft carrier is visible through the haze, while on the left, a landmass with palm trees is also engulfed in smoke from fires. The video lacks a single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the vast, destructive scale and tense atmosphere of the entire battle scene rather than focusing on any individual vessel. The focus is on conveying the environmental chaos of the conflict.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
