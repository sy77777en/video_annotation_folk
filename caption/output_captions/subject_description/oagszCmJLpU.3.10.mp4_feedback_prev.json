    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot of a powerful weather phenomenon at night. The video lacks a traditional main subject as the focus is entirely on the immense scale and awe-inspiring atmosphere of the storm, which functions as the environment itself. A colossal, rotating supercell cloud with a distinct, layered, saucer-like structure dominates the dark sky. The upper portions of the cloud are brilliantly and intermittently illuminated from within by flashes of purple and white lightning, starkly contrasting with its dark, shadowy underside from which a visible column of rain falls toward the silhouetted horizon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
