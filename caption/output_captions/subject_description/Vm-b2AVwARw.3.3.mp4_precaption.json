    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, showcasing a sprawling urban environment with a focus on a prominent, sleek skyscraper at its center. The tower features a dark, reflective facade with a distinctive, curved design that tapers towards the top, crowned by a metallic structure. Surrounding the skyscraper are numerous other high-rise buildings, varying in height and architectural style, creating a dense and dynamic skyline. The scene captures the essence of a bustling metropolis, emphasizing the scale and complexity of the urban landscape rather than focusing on a specific object or subject. The emphasis is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the grandeur and intricacy of the city as a whole.",
