Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot, focusing on a vast, serene body of water surrounded by lush greenery and distant hills. The emphasis is on the expansive environment, capturing the tranquil atmosphere and natural beauty of the area. The wide view showcases the scale of the landscape, with the water reflecting the sky and the greenery providing a rich contrast. The absence of a specific main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the overall harmony and peacefulness of the scene.",
