    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, captured from a high-angle, first-person perspective that swoops and dives through a large urban construction site. The view is dominated by massive red construction cranes and towering, modern high-rise buildings, all set against a dramatic sunset sky filled with vibrant turquoise, pink, and orange clouds. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the vast scale of the urban environment and the energetic atmosphere of development. The camera's acrobatic movement emphasizes the feeling of height and the expansive nature of the city rather than any specific object.",
