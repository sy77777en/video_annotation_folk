    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dizzying architectural scenery shot, capturing a rapid, vertiginous plunge down the center of a tall, narrow building atrium. The camera's first-person perspective hurtles downwards, causing the beige walls, accented with white molding and intermittent light fixtures, to blur into streaks. Far below, a lower floor comes into view, revealing details like a poster and a green emergency exit sign. The shot lacks a single main subject, as its primary purpose is to convey the immense vertical scale and create a disorienting sense of motion within the architectural space.",
