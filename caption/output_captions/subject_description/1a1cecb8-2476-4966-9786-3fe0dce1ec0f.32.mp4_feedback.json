    "pre_caption": "This video features an urban scenery shot from the perspective of a moving vehicle traveling down a city street. The scene is set under a pale, overcast sky, with a road bordered by a low stone wall, a park-like area with numerous trees\u2014some still bare-branched and others with new green leaves\u2014and a traffic light that is green. A person with vibrant pink hair, wearing a black face mask and dark glasses, briefly appears on the left side of the view. There is no main subject as the focus is on capturing the overall environment and atmosphere of the street. The wide, moving perspective is used to present the scale and character of the location rather than to highlight a specific individual or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
