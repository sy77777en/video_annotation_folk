    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban intersection bordered by lush green trees and a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The scene features a wide, clean sidewalk with a tactile paving strip, black metal railings, and various street signs and traffic cones, while several vehicles, including white and red cars, are visible on the road. The focus is on the overall environment, highlighting the harmonious blend of urban infrastructure and natural elements, rather than emphasizing any single object or individual. There is no main subject because the intent is to convey the atmosphere and scale of the cityscape, immersing the viewer in the setting itself.",
