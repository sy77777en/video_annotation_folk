    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a black-and-white cityscape destruction scenery shot, capturing the catastrophic collapse of ornate, multi-story buildings. Entire facades tilt and break apart, sending clouds of dust and rubble cascading downwards in a chaotic spectacle. The demolition reveals the building's skeletal interior structure, with a small, dark-clad figure momentarily visible walking across a partially destroyed floor. The shot lacks a main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and violent spectacle of the architectural destruction. The camera captures the overwhelming event itself, emphasizing the environmental chaos rather than any single entity within it.",
