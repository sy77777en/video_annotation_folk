    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a quiet, foggy street in what appears to be a historic urban neighborhood. The wet, cracked asphalt reflects the overcast sky, and a thick fog obscures the buildings in the distance, creating a moody and atmospheric quality. On the right, a black convertible and the front of a red car are parked along the curb, while on the left, a person walks along the sidewalk of a stucco building with dark shutters. A group of three people crosses the street in the middle distance, dwarfed by the surrounding architecture and the pervasive mist. The video lacks a main subject, as the focus is placed on the overall environment and the quiet, hazy atmosphere of the scene rather than on any specific individual or object.",
