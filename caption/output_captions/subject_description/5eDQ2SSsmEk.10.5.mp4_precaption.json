    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a futuristic cityscape scenery shot, looking down from a high angle into a dark, narrow chasm between immense, imposing structures. Bright spotlights and glowing red and yellow lights pierce through a dense, particle-filled atmosphere, possibly rain or snow, illuminating the wet, metallic surfaces and complex industrial architecture below, which includes visible pipes and scaffolding. There is no main subject, as the shot emphasizes the overwhelming scale and oppressive, moody atmosphere of the environment. The focus is on creating a sense of place and feeling rather than following a specific character or object.",
