Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures an urban environment with elements like traffic lights, street signs, and crosswalks, emphasizing the atmosphere of a bustling city. The focus is on the overall environment rather than a specific object, highlighting the interaction of architecture, streets, and natural elements like trees. The presence of cars and pedestrians adds to the dynamic urban setting, while the sky and distant structures contribute to the sense of scale and space.",
