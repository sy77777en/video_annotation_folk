    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm under a starry night sky. The video lacks a main subject, as the composition emphasizes the scale and atmosphere of the natural phenomenon rather than a specific object. A vast, dark storm cloud dominates the frame, intermittently and brilliantly illuminated from within by flashes of white and purple lightning. A powerful bolt of lightning also strikes down towards the ground on the right. In the distance on the left, the dark silhouette of a mountain range is visible, with the warm, scattered lights of a distant town or highway glowing at its base.",
