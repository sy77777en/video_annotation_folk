    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic skyscape scenery shot dominated by a colossal cumulonimbus cloud. The composition focuses on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the weather system, making the environment itself the primary point of interest rather than a distinct subject. This massive cloud formation, characteristic of a thunderhead, features a flattened, anvil-shaped top that is brilliantly white where it catches the sunlight, contrasting sharply with its dark, shadowed base and the deep blue of the surrounding sky. A sliver of a dark, silhouetted horizon is visible at the very bottom of the frame, emphasizing the cloud's towering presence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
