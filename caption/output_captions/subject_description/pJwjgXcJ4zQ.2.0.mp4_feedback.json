    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing the vibrant atmosphere of an urban street. The focus is on the bustling environment, showcasing a lively street with people walking along a tiled sidewalk lined with shops and advertisements. The scene transitions to a busy crosswalk, where pedestrians move purposefully across the street, surrounded by tall buildings and traffic signals. The emphasis is on the dynamic and energetic ambiance of city life, rather than any specific individual or object, highlighting the scale and activity of the urban setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
