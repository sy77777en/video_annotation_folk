    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing an expansive aerial view of Venice, Italy. The scene is dominated by the vibrant blue-green water of a major canal, with several small motorboats creating white wakes as they traverse its surface. Along the waterfront, the city's historic architecture is on full display, featuring a prominent white stone basilica with a large dome, adjacent buildings with red-tiled roofs, and a distant bell tower. There is no single main subject, as the composition is intentionally broad to emphasize the grand scale and unique atmosphere of the iconic city. The focus is on the overall environment and the interplay between the water and the dense, historic urban landscape.",
