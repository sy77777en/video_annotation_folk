    "pre_caption": "This is an atmospheric aerial cityscape scenery shot, capturing a sprawling, historic European-style city with tightly packed buildings, characterized by their red-tiled roofs and light-colored facades, peeking through a thick, rolling blanket of low-lying fog. The soft, warm light suggests either dawn or dusk, illuminating the architectural details that emerge from the ethereal mist. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the overall environment and mood. The high-angle perspective and the vast, fog-laden view direct the focus to the grand scale of the city and the dramatic interplay between the urban landscape and the natural elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
