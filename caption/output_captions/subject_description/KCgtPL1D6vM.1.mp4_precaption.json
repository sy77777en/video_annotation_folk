    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video captures a cityscape scenery shot of a bustling, narrow street in a historic European city. The view looks up a sloping road, defined by tram tracks and flanked on both sides by tall, traditional buildings with storefronts on the ground floor and balconies above. A vintage red tram is visible in the middle distance, while a white and yellow tram, decorated with small monkey illustrations and the number 574, moves across the foreground. Pedestrians can be seen on the sidewalks, and a person on a scooter drives up the street. There is no single main subject, as the camera's wide, static perspective is focused on capturing the overall environment and atmosphere of the location. The various elements\u2014the iconic trams, the distinct architecture, and the flow of people\u2014work together to create a comprehensive portrait of daily life on this specific street.",
