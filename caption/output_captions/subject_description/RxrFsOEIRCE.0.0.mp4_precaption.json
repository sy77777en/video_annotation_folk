    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a high-speed, low-altitude journey across a vibrant, sunlit countryside. The view sweeps over rolling green hills and fields under a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds, with the rapid forward motion creating a dynamic blur that emphasizes the feeling of flight. There is no main subject, as the focus is on conveying the immersive experience and the vast, open scale of the natural environment rather than highlighting a specific entity. The shadow of what appears to be a drone is briefly visible against the grass, suggesting the perspective is from a fast-moving aerial vehicle.",
