    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot, where the focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a single subject. A vast, turbulent mass of dark, brooding storm clouds dominates the sky, churning ominously over a wide, arid desert plain. The clouds are a deep grey, almost black in the densest areas, while a curtain of heavy rain is visible falling in the distance. The flat, brownish-yellow landscape below is sparsely covered with scrub brush and extends towards a faint mountain range on the horizon, creating a powerful sense of natural drama and scale.",
