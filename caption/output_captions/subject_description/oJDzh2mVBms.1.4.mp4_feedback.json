    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a vibrant green aurora borealis illuminating a nocturnal, wintry environment. The northern lights appear as broad, shifting curtains of light that fill the dark sky, with faint stars visible in the background. A dark silhouette of a dense evergreen treeline marks the horizon, separating the bright white, snow-covered ground from the dynamic sky. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to emphasize the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural phenomenon and the vast landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
