    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a serene seascape scenery shot, capturing the tranquil beauty of a pebble-strewn beach meeting the gentle waves of a vast, blue ocean. The horizon stretches endlessly under a clear sky, creating a sense of openness and calm. The focus is on the natural environment, emphasizing the rhythmic motion of the waves and the expansive scale of the sea, rather than any specific object or subject. This creates an atmosphere of peacefulness and continuity, highlighting the beauty of the natural world.",
