    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an interior architectural scenery shot of a vast, empty, and sterile tiled room. The walls, floor, and ceiling are all covered in a grid of small, off-white square tiles, giving the space a uniform and slightly disorienting quality under a pale, greenish-yellow glow cast by a row of recessed ceiling lights. In the distance, a bright vertical slit of light cuts into a far wall, contrasting with a small, dark, arched entryway guarded by a simple metal railing. The shot deliberately lacks a main subject, instead using the wide, distorted perspective to emphasize the immense scale, eerie emptiness, and liminal atmosphere of the environment itself.",
