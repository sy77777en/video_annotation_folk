    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a time-lapse cityscape scenery shot of a grand, sun-drenched European square. The scene is framed by large, ornate white buildings with brown and green-accented roofs, all under a clear blue sky. At the heart of the cobblestone square stands a prominent, dark bronze monument featuring a central figure on a high pedestal. There is no single main subject, as the time-lapse technique blurs the numerous people walking through the square into streams of motion. This effect intentionally shifts the focus from individuals to the overall bustling atmosphere and the magnificent scale of the surrounding historical architecture.",
