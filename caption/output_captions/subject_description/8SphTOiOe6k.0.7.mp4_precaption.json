    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a tranquil streetscape scenery shot of a Japanese town on a clear, sunny day. The scene is characterized by traditional Japanese architecture, including a prominent two-story building with a mustard-yellow facade, a dark tiled roof, and a red awning over its second-floor balcony. The camera pans slowly to the right, revealing a quiet street lined with similar wooden structures, a white van parked on the side, and a few pedestrians strolling along the sidewalk. In the distance, a lush green mountain rises against a blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is deliberately placed on the environment itself, capturing the peaceful atmosphere and architectural charm of the location rather than highlighting a specific person or object. The slow pan across the setting serves to immerse the viewer in the scale and ambiance of the place.",
