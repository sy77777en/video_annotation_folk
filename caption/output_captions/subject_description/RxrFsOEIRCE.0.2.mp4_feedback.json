    "pre_caption": "This video presents a fast-paced, low-altitude landscape scenery shot from an aerial perspective, likely captured by an FPV drone. The camera speeds across vast, rolling hills covered in vibrant green crops, with parallel dirt tracks creating strong leading lines that stretch towards a treeline at the crest of a hill. Above, a brilliant blue sky is dotted with fluffy white clouds. The focus of the video is on the immersive experience of flight and the expansive scale of the rural environment, rather than on a specific subject. The rapid movement creates a dynamic sense of speed, making the landscape itself the central element. A small, dark, cross-shaped shadow of the drone can be seen skimming across the ground, reinforcing the first-person perspective of the flight.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
