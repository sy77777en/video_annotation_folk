Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a neighborhood scenery shot. It captures a quiet residential street with a focus on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject. The scene features a narrow road flanked by houses, including a blue house and a distinctively textured building with a white gable. The presence of lush green trees and neatly trimmed bushes adds to the serene ambiance. Overhead, numerous power lines crisscross the clear blue sky, contributing to the sense of scale and everyday life. The emphasis is on the overall setting, highlighting the peaceful and orderly nature of the neighborhood.",
