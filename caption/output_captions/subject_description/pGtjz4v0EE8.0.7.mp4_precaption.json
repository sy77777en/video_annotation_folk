    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a bustling canal in Venice, Italy. There is no single main subject, as the high-angle perspective and prominent tilt-shift effect create a miniature-like diorama, emphasizing the overall atmosphere and scale of the environment rather than a specific element. The murky green water of the wide canal is filled with various watercraft, including long, black gondolas navigated by gondoliers, larger white water buses, and smaller motorboats. Lining both sides of the waterway are historic, multi-story buildings in warm, earthy tones. On the right bank, numerous red awnings shade what appear to be waterfront cafes or restaurants, where people are gathered, adding to the lively scene under a bright, overexposed sky.",
