    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a fast-paced, low-altitude flight over a vibrant, sunlit rural countryside. The view skims just above rolling green fields, bordered on one side by a dense forest and on the other by scattered trees leading up to a small village nestled on a distant hill under a bright blue sky. The rapid forward motion creates a significant blur, particularly at the edges of the view, which emphasizes the exhilarating speed of the journey. This focus on the immersive experience of movement through the environment means there is no single main subject; instead, the atmosphere of a swift flight across the expansive, verdant landscape takes precedence.",
