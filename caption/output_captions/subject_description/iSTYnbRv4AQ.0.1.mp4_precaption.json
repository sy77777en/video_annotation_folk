    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot that captures the dynamic energy of a European city street at dusk. There is no main subject because the rapid, forward-moving perspective and significant motion blur render individual people and vehicles indistinct, instead emphasizing the overall atmosphere and scale of the urban environment. The scene is characterized by classic, multi-story stone buildings lining a wet street, with blurred figures of pedestrians and scooters creating a sense of bustling activity against the backdrop of a fading sky.",
