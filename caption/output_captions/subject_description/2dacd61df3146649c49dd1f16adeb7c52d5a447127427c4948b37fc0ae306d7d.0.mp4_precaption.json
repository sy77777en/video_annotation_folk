Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is an interior scenery shot of an abandoned hallway. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific object. The hallway is long and narrow, with walls covered in colorful graffiti, adding a sense of urban decay. The ceiling and floor show signs of wear, with debris scattered throughout. Large windows line one side, allowing natural light to filter in, highlighting the dilapidated state. The overall mood is one of neglect and abandonment, emphasizing the scale and emptiness of the space.",
