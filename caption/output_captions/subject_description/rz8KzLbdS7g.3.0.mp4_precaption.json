    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a residential scenery shot of a quiet, sun-drenched street in a Japanese suburb. The scene is characterized by modern two-story houses with clean, geometric lines and a mix of grey and white siding, contrasted with older, more traditional homes in the background. Several vehicles, including a white kei van under a translucent carport, a silver minivan, and a small white utility truck, are parked neatly along the narrow asphalt road. The environment is punctuated by everyday details like a prominent concrete utility pole, a red fire hydrant box, a convex traffic mirror, and a web of power lines against a clear blue sky. There is no single main subject, as the camera's slow pan is intended to capture the overall tranquil atmosphere and the specific architectural character of the neighborhood, focusing on the environment itself rather than any particular object.",
