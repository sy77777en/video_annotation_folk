    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific main subject. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky filled with a massive, low-hanging storm cloud system. These dark, ominous clouds form a distinct shelf-like structure that stretches across the horizon, contrasting with the lighter gray sky above. Below, a flat, reddish-brown expanse of earth provides a stark, empty foreground that accentuates the sheer size and power of the weather formation, making the storm itself the central element of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
