    "pre_caption": "This is a top-down aerial scenery shot of a bustling container port, where rows upon rows of multi-colored shipping containers are stacked high, creating a vibrant, geometric pattern. The containers, in shades of red, green, blue, white, and yellow, are organized into massive blocks, separated by wide concrete lanes where trucks with white and red cabs maneuver. Large gantry cranes are positioned over the stacks, ready to move the cargo. There is no single main subject, as the high, static vantage point is used to emphasize the immense scale and organized complexity of the logistics hub, focusing on the overall environment and atmosphere rather than any specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
