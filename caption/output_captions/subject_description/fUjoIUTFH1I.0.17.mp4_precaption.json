    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting a quiet street in a historic district, characterized by its distinctive architecture. A two-story building with a pale yellow facade, arched doorways, and windows framed by light green wooden shutters occupies the center of the frame, with a black wrought-iron balcony running along the upper level. A classic black lamppost stands on the sidewalk next to an arched entryway. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is on capturing the architectural charm and atmosphere of the location. A person in a dark jacket walking a black dog from left to right is a transient element that adds a sense of life to the environment rather than being the central focus.",
