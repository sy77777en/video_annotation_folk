    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot on an overcast day, capturing the ambiance of a public square. In the background, a grand, white cathedral with classical architecture stands behind a black iron fence. The fence itself serves as an open-air gallery, with one side displaying colorful paintings next to a seated artist under a small red umbrella, and the other side featuring a collection of black-and-white photographs. A man in a hat and blue jacket walks along the sidewalk in the foreground, passing by the art displays. There is no single main subject, as the camera's wide, static perspective is focused on capturing the overall environment and atmosphere of the location. The focus is distributed across the architecture, the street culture of the artists, and the passersby to create a rich sense of place rather than highlighting a single focal point.",
