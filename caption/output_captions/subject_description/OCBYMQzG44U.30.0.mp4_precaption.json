    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot of an indoor, tiled space resembling a swimming pool area. Viewed from a high, downward-facing angle, a large, bright red water slide with a wide, curved opening occupies the center of the frame, set against walls and a floor covered in small, pale green tiles. The scene is illuminated by a single overhead light, casting a slightly eerie, yellowish-green glow and creating reflections on the wet-looking surfaces. The video lacks a main subject as the focus is on the unsettling and liminal atmosphere of the environment. The unusual top-down perspective and distorted geometry make the space itself the primary point of interest rather than any single object within it.",
