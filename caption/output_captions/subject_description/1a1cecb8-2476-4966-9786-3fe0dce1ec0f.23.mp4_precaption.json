Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is an urban cityscape scenery shot. It captures a street intersection with traffic lights, crosswalks, and surrounding buildings. The focus is on the environment, highlighting the urban atmosphere and layout rather than a specific object. Trees with sparse foliage line the street, and a few vehicles are present, contributing to the dynamic city setting. The emphasis is on the overall scene, showcasing the interaction between natural and urban elements.",
