    "pre_caption": "This video presents a bustling cityscape scenery shot of a historic European square. There is no single main subject, as the camera's broad, panning view is intended to capture the grand scale of the architecture and the lively atmosphere of the crowd rather than focusing on an individual. The scene unfolds on a bright, sunny day in what appears to be St. Mark's Square in Venice, teeming with tourists. In the background stands the magnificent, ornate facade of St. Mark's Basilica, with its grand arches and domes, though a portion of it is obscured by white scaffolding. To the right, the distinctive Gothic architecture of the Doge's Palace extends with its long, elegant colonnade. The square itself is filled with people in casual attire, some admiring the buildings, others walking through the crowd, and a few gathered around a souvenir cart selling colorful t-shirts and hats.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
