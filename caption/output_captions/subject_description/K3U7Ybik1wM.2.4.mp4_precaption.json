    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot of a rustic, country-style kitchen. The camera tilts up from a large, dark blue range cooker with two chrome-lidded hotplates, revealing a backsplash of wavy, white subway tiles and a stainless steel extractor hood above. The cooker is flanked by light green cabinets with curved drawer fronts and wooden countertops, with a window to the right offering a view of a green lawn. There is no main subject, as the focus is on establishing the cozy and well-appointed atmosphere of the kitchen environment itself.",
