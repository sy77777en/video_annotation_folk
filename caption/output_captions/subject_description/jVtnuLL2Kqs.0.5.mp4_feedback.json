    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing an iconic view in London. The composition is split by a large, light-colored stone pillar in the foreground, creating a striking contrast between two scenes. To the left, a contemporary white sculpture with numerous spires stands against a partly cloudy sky. To the right, a sun-drenched, empty road stretches towards the majestic Buckingham Palace in the distance, with the golden-winged statue of the Victoria Memorial visible before it. There is no main subject, as the expansive, static perspective is designed to emphasize the architectural grandeur and the atmosphere of the famous location, focusing on the sense of place rather than a particular person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
