    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This cityscape scenery shot features a low-angle, upward-tilting view of a monumental church. The building is constructed from grey concrete, with a distinctive, tiered design that emulates natural rock formations, culminating in a tall, pointed spire with a clock face near its peak. To the left, a statue of a figure stands on a large pedestal. The focus of the video is on the environment and architectural scale rather than a specific subject, using the camera's movement to convey the immense height and imposing presence of the structure against the overcast sky.",
