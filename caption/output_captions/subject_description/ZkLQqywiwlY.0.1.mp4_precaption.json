    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot focused on the side of a grey brick building in an urban alley. There is no single main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish the environment and showcase the transformation of the space. The scene is initially a plain brick wall featuring a boarded-up, arched window with a security grate, a \"NO PARKING\" sign, and a doorway on the right. Colorful, flat-style animated graphics then appear on the wall, creating a vibrant mural. This includes a large orange hand holding a pink horn that emits musical notes, a stylized fire hydrant, a blue robot-like character sitting next to a lamppost, and a large green tree held by a pink figure.",
