    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a majestic landscape scenery shot of the Grand Canyon during a dramatic sunset. The sky is a canvas of soft blues and warm, golden light, dominated by a large, dark storm cloud from which visible shafts of rain descend into the canyon below. These rain showers are backlit by the setting sun, creating a striking contrast against the deep shadows that envelop the canyon's vast, layered rock formations. The composition lacks a singular main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the immense scale, the atmospheric beauty, and the powerful, transient moment of weather interacting with the iconic landscape.",
