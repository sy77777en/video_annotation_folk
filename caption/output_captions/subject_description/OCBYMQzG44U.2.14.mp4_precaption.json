    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a point-of-view scenery shot from inside a moving vehicle, looking through the rear windshield. The scene is dominated by the dark, olive-green tint of the glass, across which run the thin, horizontal lines of a window defroster. Beyond the glass, the exterior world is a dark, indistinct blur, suggesting rapid movement through a dimly lit environment like a tunnel or a highway at night. There is no main subject, as the focus is on creating an atmospheric sense of travel and introspection. The defroster lines and blurred background work together to convey the feeling of being enclosed within a moving space rather than highlighting a specific object.",
