Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. If relevant, describe the shot's purpose, whether it is an establishing shot setting the scene or providing context, or a FPV shot that creates an immersive experience.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features an interior scenery shot of a minimalist, tiled room with water. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the serene and somewhat mysterious ambiance created by the lighting and reflections on the water. There is no main subject, as the emphasis is on the architectural space and its interaction with light and water. This type of shot could serve as an establishing shot, setting the scene by providing context and mood, or as an FPV shot, creating an immersive experience by drawing the viewer into the tranquil setting.",
