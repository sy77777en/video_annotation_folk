    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a garden scenery shot from a tropical resort, viewed from a paved patio area. A pathway composed of dark grey, rectangular stepping stones is set into fine white sand, leading away from the viewer and curving gently around the gnarled, dark brown trunk of a large tree. The scene is framed by low, off-white walls and an abundance of lush, green tropical foliage, creating a sense of secluded privacy. The video lacks a main subject because its purpose is to establish a tranquil and immersive atmosphere. The focus is on the overall environment\u2014the interplay of natural elements like sand and plants with modern design\u2014to convey a feeling of a peaceful, luxurious escape rather than to highlight a specific person or object.",
