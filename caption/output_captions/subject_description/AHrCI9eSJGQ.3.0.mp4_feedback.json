    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic maritime scenery shot, captured from the bow of a massive container ship looking out over the open ocean. The foreground is dominated by towering stacks of red, blue, and orange shipping containers, which frame the expansive view ahead. The sea is calm, stretching to the horizon where a lone, distant vessel is faintly visible. Above, a vast, time-lapsed sky is filled with streaky, fast-moving clouds illuminated by a warm, golden-orange light, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale of the ocean and the atmospheric, dynamic sky, making the vast environment itself the focus of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
