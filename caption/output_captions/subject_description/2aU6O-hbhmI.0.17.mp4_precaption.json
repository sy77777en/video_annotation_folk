Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures the urban environment, focusing on the scale and architecture of a tall building with numerous windows and balconies. The emphasis is on the atmosphere of the city, highlighted by the building's illuminated windows against a dusky sky. The presence of other buildings and the expansive view contribute to the overall sense of the urban landscape, rather than focusing on a specific object or subject.",
