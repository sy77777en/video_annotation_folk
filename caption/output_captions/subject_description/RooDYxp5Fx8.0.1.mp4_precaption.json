    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a street in Japan on a bright, sunny day. The focus is on the overall urban environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, capturing a sense of place and time. A modern, grey, arched entrance to the Gojo subway station stands prominently on the sidewalk, with its signage clearly visible. Pedestrians and a cyclist move along the pavement, which is lined with a mix of multi-story buildings. In the background, traffic flows down the street, and green mountains are visible in the distance under a clear blue sky, completing the urban landscape.",
