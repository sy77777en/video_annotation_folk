    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting a quiet, wet street in what appears to be the French Quarter of New Orleans. On the left, a large, white, lifted pickup truck is parked in the foreground, followed by a line of other cars, including a black sports car. The buildings feature characteristic wrought-iron balconies with hanging plants, while on the right, flags hang from poles along a covered sidewalk. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is on capturing the unique architectural environment and the quiet, atmospheric quality of the overcast, foggy scene.",
