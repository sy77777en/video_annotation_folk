Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a view of towering buildings lining a street, with a prominent skyscraper in the background. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighted by the symmetry of the architecture and the warm glow of streetlights. The scene emphasizes the scale and grandeur of the urban landscape rather than a specific object, creating a sense of immersion in the city environment.",
