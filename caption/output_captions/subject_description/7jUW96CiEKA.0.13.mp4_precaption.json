Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot, focusing on a serene natural environment. It captures a tranquil river meandering through a lush, green area with dense foliage and scattered trees. The atmosphere is calm, with soft lighting suggesting early morning or late afternoon. The emphasis is on the overall environment and the peaceful ambiance, rather than any specific object or subject. The presence of animals, such as elephants, adds to the natural setting but does not dominate the scene, allowing the viewer to appreciate the scale and beauty of the landscape.",
