    "pre_caption_prompt": "**Objective**: **Generate a highly descriptive and fluent video caption based on the entire video content.** You are an expert in scene understanding and narration. Carefully analyze the full video and describe the key subjects, their actions, motion progression, interactions, relevant background dynamics, and any important temporal or emotional cues.\n\n**Note**: The video may contain multiple shots or continuous motion. Your caption should be a coherent paragraph that summarizes the most relevant visual and temporal events, without assuming missing content. Do not fabricate content that cannot be reasonably inferred from the visuals.\n\n**Important**:\n- Do NOT describe how the camera moves (e.g., no \"zoom\", \"pan\", or \"cut\").\n- Do NOT describe visual effects or editing.\n- Focus on what happens in the **scene**: people, objects, animals, environments, motion, and interactions.\n- If the video is short (e.g., a few seconds), focus on fine-grained movements and visual details.\n\n**Answering Style**:\n- Output should be in **natural English** and use **complete sentences**.\n- Avoid generic phrases like \"The video shows...\" or \"The footage captures...\".\n- Start directly with the subject and their action, e.g., \"A boy runs through a wheat field...\"\n\n**Output Format**:\n\"[one-paragraph, highly descriptive video caption]\"",
    "pre_caption": "A soldier, initially positioned behind a large, dark metallic container, moves forward into a war-torn, tropical environment. In the near distance, an enemy vehicle is visible amidst rubble and trees, with a damaged building further back. The soldier then takes control of a mounted weapon, aims at an enemy combatant standing near a low wall, and fires. The enemy soldier is hit and falls to the ground, with on-screen text confirming the kill. The action unfolds in an outdoor setting with scattered debris and vegetation, under an objective labeled \"ARMED.\"",
