    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior scenery shot. There is no main subject because the focus is deliberately placed on the overall atmosphere and environment of the dimly lit room rather than singling out a specific object or person. The composition includes a dark wooden door, slightly ajar, revealing a sliver of light, flanked by a wall with a light switch, a framed picture, and a side table holding a lamp, a framed photo, and a bowl. To the right of the door, another larger framed artwork hangs on the wall. The static camera and low lighting contribute to establishing a specific mood and sense of place, making the setting itself the primary point of interest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.",
