    "pre_caption": "This is an aerial landscape scenery shot of a vast, tranquil river or lake under a soft, overcast sky tinged with pink and purple hues. The expansive body of water is dotted with low-lying, sandy islands and peninsulas, one of which hosts a small settlement with a simple wooden structure and numerous long, narrow boats moored along its shore. In the distance, flat, green plains stretch to a hazy horizon. The video lacks a main subject because its high-angle, wide perspective is intended to emphasize the immense scale of the natural environment and create a serene, atmospheric mood. The composition highlights the relationship between the water, the land, and the small human presence within the vast landscape, rather than focusing on any single element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
