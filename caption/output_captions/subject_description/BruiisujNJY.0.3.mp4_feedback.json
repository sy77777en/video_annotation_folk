    "pre_caption": "This is a natural landscape scenery shot that takes the viewer on a slow journey through a dark and narrow rock passage, resembling a cave or a tight canyon. The environment is shrouded in near-total darkness, with only a faint, warm, reddish-orange light emanating from an unseen source further down the path, which gradually illuminates the rough, layered texture of the rock walls. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the mysterious and foreboding atmosphere of the environment itself. The camera's slow, peeking movement emphasizes a sense of exploration and discovery within the dimly lit space rather than centering on any specific object or character.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
