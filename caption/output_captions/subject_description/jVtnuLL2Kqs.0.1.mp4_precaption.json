    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents an atmospheric interior scenery shot, moving forward through a long, dark, and symmetrical hallway. The corridor is lined with numerous identical closed doors on either side, with thin slivers of light seeping from underneath them. The floor is dark and highly reflective, mirroring the stark contrast between the shadowy foreground and the intensely bright, white light emanating from an open doorway at the very end of the hall. The focus is entirely on the environment and the feeling it evokes, using the strong leading lines and dramatic lighting to create a sense of mystery, infinity, or passage. There is no main subject because the composition is designed to draw the viewer's eye through the space itself, making the atmosphere and the journey toward the light the central experience. The stark, monochromatic aesthetic emphasizes form and contrast over specific details, further centering the environmental mood.",
