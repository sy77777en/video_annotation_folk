    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic maritime scenery shot, captured in a time-lapse from the bow of a massive container ship navigating the open ocean at night. The perspective looks out over stacks of colorful shipping containers toward the dark, expansive sea under a cloudy, star-dusted sky. As the clouds scud rapidly overhead, distant lights glimmer on the horizon, and a brilliant, greenish-white light streaks through the atmosphere before fading. The composition emphasizes the immense scale of the environment and the solitary feeling of being at sea. The vastness of the ocean and the dynamic sky are the true focus, rather than any single object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
