    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a mountain landscape scenery shot. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the winter environment rather than any specific person or object. The video, captured from a high, wide-angle perspective, reveals a vast, snow-covered mountain peak under a clear blue sky, with a ski lift cable stretching across the view and a gondola passing by. Below, the steep slope is dotted with reddish-brown rock formations and several small figures of skiers making their way down, while a ski lift station sits atop the peak. As the camera pulls back, it unveils the full expanse of the surrounding mountain range, stretching into the distant horizon and emphasizing the grandeur of the alpine setting.",
