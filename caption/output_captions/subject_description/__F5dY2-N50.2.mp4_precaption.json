    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video captures an architectural scenery shot of a secluded outdoor patio, likely at a tropical resort. The space features a modern grey-paved area with a round, glass-topped wicker table and cushioned lounge chairs, which gives way to a sandy garden with a large tree and lush green foliage bordered by a low white wall. There is no main subject because the focus is on establishing a sense of place and a tranquil atmosphere. The composition is designed to immerse the viewer in the environment, emphasizing the blend of comfortable design with natural, private surroundings rather than focusing on a specific person or action.",
