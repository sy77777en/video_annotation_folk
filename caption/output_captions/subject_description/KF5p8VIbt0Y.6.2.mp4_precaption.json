    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing the illuminated neon signage of an entertainment venue at night, with glowing letters and decorative lights set against a dark, rainy urban backdrop. The focus is on the interplay of artificial light, reflections, and the atmospheric effects of rain, emphasizing the mood and ambiance of the city environment rather than highlighting any specific object or individual. There is no main subject because the intent is to immerse the viewer in the overall atmosphere and visual texture of the city at night, drawing attention to the environment and its evocative qualities.",
