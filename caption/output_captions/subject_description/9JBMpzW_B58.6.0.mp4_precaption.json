    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an industrial scenery shot from a high-angle perspective aboard a container ship docked at a port. The view looks out over stacks of multicolored shipping containers on the ship's deck towards a massive white ship-to-shore crane, which is labeled \"SAVANNAH, GA. U.S.A no 39\" and dominates the frame. In the background, a wide river and the sprawling port with more cranes and container stacks are visible under a grey, overcast sky. The scene is captured through a lens spattered with raindrops, adding to the gloomy, wet atmosphere. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale of the maritime shipping operation and the industrial environment rather than focusing on a specific object or action.",
