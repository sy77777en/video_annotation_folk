    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a stunning time-lapse seascape, captured from a high-angle perspective aboard a massive container ship. The view looks forward from the bow, over rows of blue, red, and white shipping containers, towards the endless, calm ocean. The primary focus is the dramatic transformation of the sky; initially, wispy clouds drift across a blue canvas, which then gives way to a spectacular sunset, painting the clouds in vibrant shades of pink and purple. As darkness falls, the colors deepen, and stars begin to emerge in the night sky. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the vastness of the open sea and the dynamic, atmospheric beauty of the changing sky, making the environment itself the central focus.",
