    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a tranquil landscape scenery shot that emphasizes the vastness and atmosphere of a winter evening. There is no single main subject, as the composition is designed to capture the serene beauty of the entire environment. The video presents a wide, snow-covered field under a deep blue twilight sky, where a single, brilliant celestial body, possibly a planet or the moon, shines brightly. Along the distant horizon, a thin band of orange and yellow light from the set sun backlights a dense silhouette of coniferous trees. A snow-covered path with visible tracks cuts through the foreground, leading the eye toward the fading light and creating a sense of quiet solitude.",
