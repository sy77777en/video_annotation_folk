Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures the towering presence of a red brick and glass building, emphasizing its height and architectural details. The focus is on the urban environment, showcasing the building's vertical lines and the surrounding city structures. The perspective highlights the scale and atmosphere of the city, rather than concentrating on a specific object or subject. The lighting and angles contribute to the dynamic and immersive feel of the urban landscape.",
