    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic cityscape scenery shot at night, dominated by a powerful thunderstorm. Brilliant flashes of purple and white lightning illuminate a large bank of clouds from within, creating a spectacular and turbulent display against the dark sky. Below the storm, the silhouette of rooftops occupies the foreground, while further in the distance, various buildings are brightly lit with yellow and white lights, establishing the urban setting. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on capturing the awe-inspiring atmosphere and scale of the natural weather phenomenon unfolding over the city.",
