    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot, capturing a serene rural environment. The focus is on the expansive sky filled with fluffy, scattered clouds that create a dynamic and ever-changing atmosphere. The road stretches into the distance, flanked by lush green fields and occasional trees, emphasizing the vastness and tranquility of the countryside. Power lines run parallel to the road, adding a sense of scale and perspective. The absence of a specific main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the harmonious blend of natural and man-made elements, highlighting the peaceful coexistence of human infrastructure and the natural landscape.",
