    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.",
    "pre_caption": "This video features a landscape scenery shot, depicting a wide expanse of calm water, likely a lake or reservoir, dotted with small, exposed landmasses and islands under a soft, hazy sky tinged with pink and grey clouds. Numerous long, narrow boats are clustered along a spit of land jutting into the water, near a small, simple structure. The shot lacks a single main subject because its purpose is to convey the vastness and atmosphere of the environment; the focus is distributed across the expansive water body, the distant flat terrain, the arrangement of the boats, and the quality of light, emphasizing the overall scale and tranquil mood rather than highlighting any particular object or individual.",
