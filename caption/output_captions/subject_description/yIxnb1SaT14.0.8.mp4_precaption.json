Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph. Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a nighttime cityscape scenery shot. There is no single main subject because the focus is deliberately placed on capturing the overall environment, atmosphere, and scale of the Parisian scene along the River Seine at night. The composition encompasses the river reflecting numerous lights, bordered by illuminated stone embankments and multi-story traditional buildings with glowing windows. In the distance, the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral is prominently featured, illuminated against the dark sky near a bridge, while a brightly lit tour boat with blue decorative lights travels along the water, adding dynamism to the scene rather than being its primary focus. The emphasis is on the collective visual experience and mood of the location rather than highlighting one specific element.",
