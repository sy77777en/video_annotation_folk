    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a sun-drenched, empty cobblestone street leading towards a large, intricate metal arch bridge. An old, multi-story building with a small balcony lines the left side of the street, while the massive structure of the bridge dominates the right. The video lacks a main subject because its focus is on capturing the atmosphere and sense of place. The low-angle perspective and the bright, glaring sun create long shadows and a prominent lens flare, emphasizing the quiet, early morning mood of the historic urban environment rather than a specific person or object.",
