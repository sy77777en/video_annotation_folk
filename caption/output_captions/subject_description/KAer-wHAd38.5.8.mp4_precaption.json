    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a streetscape scenery shot, capturing a sunlit, tranquil neighborhood with a clear blue sky dotted by fluffy white clouds overhead. The scene features a wide, paved road flanked by a mix of residential buildings, lush green trees, and neatly trimmed bushes, all bathed in bright daylight. The focus is on the overall environment, highlighting the peaceful atmosphere, vibrant greenery, and the spaciousness of the street rather than any specific object or individual. There is no main subject because the intent is to showcase the ambiance and scale of the neighborhood, immersing the viewer in the setting itself.",
