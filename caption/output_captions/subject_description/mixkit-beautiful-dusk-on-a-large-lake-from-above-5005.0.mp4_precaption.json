    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an aerial landscape scenery shot capturing a vast, tranquil body of water surrounded by a dramatic range of mountains. The scene is bathed in the warm, golden light of a low sun, which peeks over the silhouetted peaks and casts ethereal sunbeams through a thick layer of mist, reflecting softly on the calm, greenish-teal water below. Small, tree-covered islands are scattered across the water, adding to the serene and expansive vista. There is no main subject because the focus is on conveying the immense scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural environment. The shot is intended to immerse the viewer in the serene, misty mood created by the interplay of light, water, and mountains, rather than drawing attention to a specific object or landform. The landscape itself, in its entirety, serves as the subject.",
