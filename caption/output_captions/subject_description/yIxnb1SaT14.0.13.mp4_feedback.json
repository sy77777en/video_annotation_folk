    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, focusing on the overall urban atmosphere and the passage of time rather than a specific main subject. The long-exposure technique intentionally abstracts the moving traffic, making the environment itself the primary focus. At the center of the composition stands the Arc de Triomphe, its light-colored stone facade and intricate sculptural details brightly illuminated against a dark, cloudy night sky. Encircling the base of the monumental arch are fluid streaks of red, white, and yellow light from the traffic, creating a vibrant sense of motion that contrasts with the timeless stillness of the historic landmark.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
