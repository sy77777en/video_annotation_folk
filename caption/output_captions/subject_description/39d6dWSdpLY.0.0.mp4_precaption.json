    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot, captured from the perspective of a vehicle moving along a long, cracked asphalt road. The road stretches into the distance, leading the eye toward a majestic range of snow-capped mountains illuminated by the warm, golden light of either sunrise or sunset. The surrounding terrain is an arid plain covered in low, dry brush under a clear blue sky. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to emphasize the vast scale of the natural environment and evoke the feeling of a journey through an open, expansive landscape.",
