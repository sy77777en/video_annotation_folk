    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot dominated by a massive weather system. A colossal, brilliantly white cumulonimbus cloud fills the upper portion of the frame against a vivid blue sky. The underside of this cloud formation is a dark, flat grey, and distinct shafts of heavy rain can be seen falling from it, creating a curtain of precipitation over the distant terrain. Below, a wide, flat expanse of green scrubland stretches towards a faint line of mountains on the horizon. The video lacks a main subject, as its focus is on capturing the immense scale and atmospheric power of the storm, highlighting the grandeur of the natural environment itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
