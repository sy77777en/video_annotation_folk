    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, capturing the ambiance of a European-style public square. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on establishing the atmosphere and sense of place rather than highlighting a specific person or object. The camera moves along a cobblestone pavement, passing the enclosed outdoor patio of a restaurant. The patio structure features dark wood framing and large glass windows, through which neatly set dining tables with white tablecloths and wine glasses are visible. In the background, people stroll past a grand, light-colored stone building with prominent columns and steps, while a classic, ornate dark green lamppost stands on the corner.",
