    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a night sky scenery shot, where the primary focus is on the atmospheric phenomenon rather than a distinct subject. Against an almost completely black sky, a faint, diffuse, and elongated patch of green light, characteristic of an aurora, is visible. In the lower left corner, the dark silhouette of what appears to be a tree is faintly discernible. Below this and slightly to the left, a small structure with a brightly lit roofline, adorned with a string of lights, can be seen. A tiny, bright blue light briefly appears in the lower right portion of the frame. The overall composition emphasizes the vastness of the dark sky and the subtle beauty of the aurora, making the environment itself the central element.",
