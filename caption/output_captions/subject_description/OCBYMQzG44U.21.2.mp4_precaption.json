    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot of a long, eerie corridor with a distinct liminal quality. The walls and ceiling are covered in small, greenish-yellow tiles, and the space recedes into the distance through a series of repeating arches, creating a disorienting effect. A hazy, foggy atmosphere permeates the scene, which is dimly illuminated by a single, glowing circular light fixture on the right-hand wall and a brighter, unseen light source at the far end of the passage. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is intentionally placed on the unsettling and seemingly endless nature of the environment itself, emphasizing the atmosphere of isolation and mystery over any particular entity.",
