    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, capturing a bustling city street corner at night through a long-exposure or time-lapse technique. A grand, multi-story building with classical architecture, warmly illuminated against the dark sky, dominates the frame, featuring a prominent red and white circular banner on its facade. Streaks of white and red light from moving traffic flow across the cobblestone street in the foreground, creating a sense of motion and energy. There is no single main subject, as the composition is designed to showcase the overall urban atmosphere, the architectural grandeur, and the vibrant flow of city life rather than focusing on a specific person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
