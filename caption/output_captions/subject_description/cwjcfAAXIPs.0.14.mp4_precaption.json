Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot.\n\nThe video focuses on capturing the urban environment and atmosphere rather than a specific main subject. It presents a street-level view featuring a modern frosted glass barrier atop a dark stone wall juxtaposed with older, weathered building facades. One building has a pale green, graffiti-covered door adorned with posters, while the adjacent one features a large window covered by light curtains and displaying small signs. The emphasis is on the overall scene, textures, and architectural contrast, characteristic of a scenery shot where the environment itself is the focus.",
