    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot capturing the exterior of a two-story, red brick house under a flat, overcast sky. The building displays a dark gabled roof with white trim, and a prominent feature on the second story is a white stucco panel accented with dark timber framing. A tall, multi-trunked yucca tree with spiky green leaves stands in the foreground, its branches partially obscuring the brick facade. The shot lacks a main subject, as its purpose is to establish a sense of place and capture the specific architectural style and atmosphere of the location. The composition emphasizes the interplay between the man-made structure and the surrounding vegetation rather than singling out a particular person or object.",
