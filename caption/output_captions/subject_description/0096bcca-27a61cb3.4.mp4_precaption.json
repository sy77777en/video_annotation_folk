    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a dark city street at night from what appears to be the perspective of a vehicle's dashboard. The scene is illuminated by the glow of red traffic lights and a bright overhead streetlight, which creates a prominent circular lens flare against the black sky. Faintly visible are the outlines of buildings to the right and the headlights of distant cars, adding to the urban atmosphere. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the overall environment and the quiet, atmospheric mood of a city intersection after dark, rather than on any specific person or object.",
