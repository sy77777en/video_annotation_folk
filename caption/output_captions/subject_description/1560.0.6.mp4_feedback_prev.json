    "pre_caption": "The video presents a cityscape scenery shot featuring the Statue of Liberty, a colossal neoclassical sculpture, standing tall on its pedestal on Liberty Island. The statue, with its distinctive greenish patina, holds a torch aloft in its right hand and a tabula ansata in its left. The island is surrounded by choppy, dark blue water, and in the distant background, a hazy city skyline with various buildings is visible under a pale blue sky with wispy white clouds. The focus is on the overall environment and the iconic landmark within its setting, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere rather than a singular, specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
