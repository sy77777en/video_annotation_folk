    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping aerial cityscape scenery shot, capturing the vibrant energy of a dense urban environment at night. The high-angle perspective looks down upon a complex network of streets and Haussmann-style buildings, their windows glowing like scattered embers in the darkness. Long-exposure photography transforms the moving traffic into brilliant streaks of white and red light, which flow along the roads and converge at a brightly lit intersection. The focus is not on any individual element but on the sprawling scale and dynamic atmosphere of the city itself, conveyed through the intricate patterns of architecture and the mesmerizing flow of artificial light.",
