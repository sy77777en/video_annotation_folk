    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a serene landscape scenery shot, capturing a tranquil expanse of water with small, scattered landmasses. The focus is on the vastness and calmness of the environment, highlighted by the soft, pastel hues of the sky reflecting on the water's surface. The distant horizon and gentle cloud formations contribute to a sense of openness and tranquility, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere rather than any specific object. The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the harmonious blend of natural elements, creating a peaceful and contemplative mood.",
