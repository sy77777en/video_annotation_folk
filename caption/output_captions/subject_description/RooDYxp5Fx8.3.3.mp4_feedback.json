    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban environment characterized by modern buildings with clean lines and varied facades, a well-maintained sidewalk with tactile paving, and a busy street featuring vehicles such as a black van and a large white truck. The scene is bright and clear, with a blue sky and scattered clouds overhead, and signage in Japanese providing a sense of place. There is no main subject in the video; instead, the focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the city, emphasizing the interplay between architecture, infrastructure, and daily urban life rather than highlighting any specific object or individual.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
