    "pre_caption": "The video presents a breathtaking cityscape scenery shot of Paris at night, centered on the iconic Eiffel Tower. The tower, illuminated in a brilliant golden-yellow light, stands majestically against the dark, cloudy sky, with a bright blue-white spotlight rotating from its apex. In the foreground, the River Seine flows, its dark water beautifully reflecting the myriad city lights in shimmering streaks of green, blue, and gold. Along the riverbanks, numerous boats are docked, and the city's architecture is lit up, while on the far left, the headlights and taillights of moving vehicles create long, glowing trails of white and red. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to capture the grand scale, vibrant energy, and romantic atmosphere of the urban environment, immersing the viewer in the iconic \"City of Lights.\"",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
