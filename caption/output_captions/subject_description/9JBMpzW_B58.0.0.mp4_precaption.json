    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a breathtaking night-time seascape scenery shot, captured from the bow of a large cargo ship. The primary focus is on the immense and dynamic environment rather than a specific subject, emphasizing the vastness of nature. The camera looks out over a dark, calm ocean towards a horizon where a faint, ethereal green and reddish glow of an aurora dances beneath a sky blanketed with an incredible density of brilliant stars. Dark, low-lying clouds drift across the frame, partially obscuring the celestial display and adding a sense of movement and depth to the atmospheric scene. The foreground is occupied by the deck and the tops of shipping containers, which serve as a stable vantage point, grounding the viewer within this spectacular natural light show.",
