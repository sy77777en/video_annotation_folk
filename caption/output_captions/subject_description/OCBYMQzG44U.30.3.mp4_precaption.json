    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an aquatic interior scenery shot, capturing a view from a low perspective at the surface of murky, green water within an enclosed tank. The environment is defined by stark, white-tiled walls under the bright, diffuse light of several small, high windows. The shot lacks a singular main subject, as the immersive viewpoint emphasizes the claustrophobic atmosphere and the unsettling quality of the confined space itself. The focus is on the overall environment rather than on the dark, curved form breaking the rippling surface in the foreground or the red and white object floating in the distance.",
