    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of two bonsai trees. The first bonsai tree on the left has a lush, green canopy with a slightly twisted trunk, planted in a rectangular pot with moss. The second bonsai tree on the right has a dense, dark green foliage with a more intricate trunk structure, placed in a similar pot with visible soil and pebbles. As the camera moves upward, the tops of the trees are revealed, showcasing their detailed branches and leaves. Eventually, the bonsai trees nearly move out of the frame, and the upper body of a man appears in the background. He is wearing a red T-shirt and has a short hairstyle. The man is positioned slightly to the right, facing upward with a focused expression, suggesting he is engaged in an activity or observing something above. The background includes wooden structures and trees, adding a natural setting to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don\u2019t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject\u2019s type, using precise terms such as \u201cman,\u201d \u201cwoman,\u201d \u201cdog,\u201d \u201ccar,\u201d or \u201ctree,\u201d rather than vague words like \u201cthing\u201d or \u201citem.\u201d If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject\u2019s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as \u201cthe man,\u201d \u201cthe dog,\u201d or \u201cthe tree.\u201d If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., \u201cthe woman in the red dress,\u201d \u201cthe man with the beard\u201d), location within the scene (e.g., \u201cthe man on the left,\u201d \u201cthe car in the midground\u201d), actions (e.g., \u201cthe child playing with a ball,\u201d \u201cthe bird flying\u201d), or relationships to each other (e.g., \u201cthe man next to the woman,\u201d \u201cthe first man that enters the frame\u201d). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn\u2019t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject\u2019s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a medium shot focused on the base of two bonsai trees. The camera then moves upward to reveal the tops of the trees. As the camera continues to move up, the bonsai trees nearly move out of the frame. Finally, the upper body of a man in red T-shirt appears in the background.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
