    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a drive through a city intersection at night. The scene is illuminated by streetlights, traffic signals, and the glowing signs of businesses, including a prominent Gulf gas station and various storefronts, with a few cars and a city bus visible at the intersection. The video lacks a main subject as the camera continuously pans and moves forward, presenting a broad view of the urban environment. The focus is on conveying the atmosphere and scale of the city at night rather than highlighting a specific person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
