    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a bustling Parisian avenue at night, with the grand, illuminated Palais Garnier opera house serving as the central focal point at the end of the street. The ornate building features a large green dome topped with a statue, flanked by golden figures, all brightly lit against the dark sky. The scene is filled with the heavy, flowing traffic of cars and large tour buses, their red and white lights creating streaks of motion that convey a sense of vibrant energy. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to emphasize the magnificent scale of the architecture and the lively atmosphere of the city, rather than any single person or object.",
