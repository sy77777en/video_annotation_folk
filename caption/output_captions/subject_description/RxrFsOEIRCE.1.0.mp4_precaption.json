Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot. There is no main subject because the focus is on capturing the expansive rural environment, characterized by rolling green fields, scattered trees, a dirt path, and a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds, emphasizing the atmosphere and scale of the natural setting rather than a specific object or entity. The rapid, low-angle movement further contributes to an immersive experience of the landscape itself.",
