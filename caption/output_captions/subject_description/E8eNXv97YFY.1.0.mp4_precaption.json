    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a broad view of an urban park area dominated by a tall, intricately designed monument with tiered architecture and dark stonework, set against a dramatic sky with scattered clouds. The scene includes manicured green lawns, a paved walkway, and several national flags, with modern buildings visible in the background, all contributing to a sense of scale and atmosphere. There is no main subject because the focus is on the overall environment and the monument\u2019s relationship to the city, emphasizing the grandeur and ambiance of the location rather than highlighting any individual object or person.",
