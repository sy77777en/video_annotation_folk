    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an abstract, close-up scenery shot that emphasizes texture and form over a discernible subject. The composition is split between two contrasting surfaces, with the focus placed on the environment's material qualities to create a mysterious atmosphere. On the left, a rough, sandy-colored surface is marked by a faint grid pattern and dark specks. Juxtaposed against it on the right is a dark, reddish-brown material with a leathery or wooden texture, distinguished by a horizontal row of dark, circular indentations. The dim, warm lighting enhances the tactile nature of the scene, drawing attention to the textures themselves rather than a specific object.",
