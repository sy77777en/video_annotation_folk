    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a tranquil urban scenery shot of a Japanese street corner. The view from a clean, tiled sidewalk looks across an intersection towards a hillside covered in lush, green trees, with the roof of a traditional building peeking through the foliage. A large, modern concrete overpass curves across the right side of the frame, contrasting with the natural landscape. The shot lacks a central subject, as the static camera captures a wide perspective that gives equal weight to the road, the bridge, the trees, and the bright blue sky with fluffy clouds, focusing on the peaceful atmosphere and the harmonious blend of nature and infrastructure.",
