    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide cityscape scenery shot capturing a dense urban skyline from across a dark river. The composition features a mix of architectural styles, with modern glass skyscrapers, including a distinctive building with a curved, flared top, rising behind older, classical-style stone buildings and a multi-tiered structure in the mid-ground. A stone arch bridge is visible on the left, and the scene is set under a dramatic sky filled with large, white and grey cumulus clouds against patches of blue. There is no main subject, as the camera's wide perspective is used to emphasize the grand scale and atmosphere of the entire urban environment rather than focusing on a single element.",
