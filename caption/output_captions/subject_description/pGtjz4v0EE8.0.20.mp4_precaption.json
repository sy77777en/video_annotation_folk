    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot capturing a static, detailed view of a magnificent Gothic cathedral's facade. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, showcasing the grandeur of the structure rather than a specific subject. Bathed in the golden light of a low sun, the building's intricate polychrome marble exterior, with its white and green geometric patterns, is thrown into high relief by deep, slowly shifting shadows. The composition highlights rows of sculpted figures standing in ornate, pointed-arch niches, the detailed relief carvings within a large triangular pediment over a portal, and the complex tracery of a large rose window on the right.",
