    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a time-lapse landscape scenery shot of a dramatic sunset over a vast, verdant field. The sky is a canvas of swirling clouds, ranging from dark and brooding to light and ethereal, all set against the warm, golden-yellow light of the sun sinking below the horizon. A still body of water in the foreground acts as a perfect mirror, reflecting the entire celestial display with stunning clarity. As the time-lapse progresses, the ambient light fades, casting the lush landscape and distant trees into dark silhouettes against the colorful sky. The shot intentionally lacks a main subject, instead emphasizing the immersive atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural scene, allowing the viewer to be captivated by the dynamic beauty of the changing light and the cloud-filled sky.",
