    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a vibrant cityscape scenery shot, capturing the dynamic and colorful essence of an urban environment at night. Neon lights in various hues of red, purple, green, and yellow illuminate the scene, reflecting off surfaces and creating a lively, almost surreal atmosphere. The focus is on the interplay of lights and colors rather than any specific object, emphasizing the bustling energy and scale of the city. The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the overall ambiance and the intricate patterns formed by the lights and structures.",
