    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot, captured from a low, forward-moving aerial perspective over a vast, wet sand flat. The camera glides across the expansive beach, which is marked by varying shades of brown and beige sand, toward a calm body of water that reflects the muted, overcast sky. In the distance, a long range of dark, verdant mountains stretches across the horizon, their peaks softened by a light haze. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the immense scale and serene, slightly somber atmosphere of the coastal environment. The focus is on the interplay between the land, water, and mountains under the soft, diffused light, creating a feeling of solitude and tranquility.",
