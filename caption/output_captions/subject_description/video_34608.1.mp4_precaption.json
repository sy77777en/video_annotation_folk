    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot featuring a vast mountain range shrouded in a thick blanket of white clouds. Lush green forests cover the slopes of the mountains in the foreground, which are partially obscured by rolling fog. In the distance, the dark, sharp peaks of taller mountains pierce through the sea of clouds under a pale, overcast sky. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is instead on capturing the serene and majestic atmosphere of the high-altitude environment, emphasizing the immense scale of the landscape and the ethereal quality of the clouds enveloping it.",
