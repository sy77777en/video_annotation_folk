    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting a public park or square on a bright day. A wide, paved walkway leads through the center of the frame towards a tall, light-colored monument, with a large, multi-story residential building visible in the background. The scene is framed by lush, green trees and dotted with wooden benches along the path and on the surrounding lawns, where various people appear, enjoying the park\u2014some sit, others stroll, and a child runs. There is no single main subject; the focus is on establishing the environment and capturing the tranquil, everyday atmosphere of the urban green space. The shot emphasizes the scale and collective life of the location rather than a specific object or person.",
