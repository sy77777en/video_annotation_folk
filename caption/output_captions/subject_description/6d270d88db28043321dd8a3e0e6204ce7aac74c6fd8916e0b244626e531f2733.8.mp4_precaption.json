    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide, high-angle landscape scenery shot of a vast and tranquil waterscape, likely at dawn or dusk. A long, narrow sandbar or peninsula juts out into the calm water, which reflects the soft pink and lavender tones of the overcast sky. Numerous small, dark fishing boats are moored along the edges of this sandbar, gathered around a small, rustic settlement. In the far distance, a hazy landmass with low mountains stretches across the horizon. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the expansive scale of the environment and the peaceful, atmospheric mood created by the soft light, rather than to focus on a particular object or action.",
