    "pre_caption": "This video is a quiet cityscape scenery shot of a street in what appears to be the French Quarter of New Orleans, enveloped in a thick, gray fog. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the moody, still atmosphere of the environment. Muted gray and brick buildings with characteristic wrought-iron balconies, adorned with hanging flower baskets, line the wet, empty street. The dense fog softens the architectural details in the distance, creating a sense of quiet solitude and emphasizing the classic design of the buildings in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
