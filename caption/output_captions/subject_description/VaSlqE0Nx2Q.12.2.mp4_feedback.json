    "pre_caption": "This video presents a stark, black and white landscape scenery shot of a coastal environment in what appears to be winter. The camera's perspective is from a high vantage point on a snow-covered sand dune, looking down a path that leads towards the ocean. Dark, leafless, and thorny bushes in the foreground frame the view on both the left and right sides, guiding the eye towards the wide, flat beach and the calm sea beyond. The focus of the shot is on the overall desolate and quiet atmosphere of the environment, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape and the moody, overcast sky rather than a specific main subject. The composition uses the natural lines of the dunes and bushes to create a sense of depth and draw the viewer into the cold, serene scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
