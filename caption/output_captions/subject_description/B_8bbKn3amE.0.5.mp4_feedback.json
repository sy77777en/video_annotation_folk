    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dynamic aerial cityscape scenery shot, captured from the perspective of a fast-moving drone. The camera swoops and glides over a dense, sprawling city built on a mountainside, characterized by its ubiquitous red-orange terracotta-tiled roofs and white-walled buildings. The exhilarating flight path navigates through narrow gaps and over rooftops, eventually revealing a historic-looking white church with a brick bell tower perched on a higher elevation. There is no single main subject, as the rapid, immersive camera movement is designed to showcase the overall scale, atmosphere, and unique architectural texture of the city itself, rather than isolating a specific focal point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
