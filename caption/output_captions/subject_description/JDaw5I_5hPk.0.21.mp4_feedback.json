    "pre_caption": "This is a nature scenery shot capturing a view of a shallow, rocky creek flowing through a lush, green forest. The perspective is from above, looking down into a shaded ravine, with out-of-focus foliage in the foreground creating a natural frame around the dark, rippling water. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is instead on the tranquil and secluded atmosphere of the forest environment. The composition emphasizes the feeling of peeking into a hidden, natural space rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
