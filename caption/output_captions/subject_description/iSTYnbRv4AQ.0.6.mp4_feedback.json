    "pre_caption": "This video is a cityscape scenery shot captured from the point of view of a fast-moving train. The perspective looks forward along a set of tracks that converge in the distance, flanked by tall urban buildings that are heavily distorted by motion blur, creating streaks of light and color. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the dynamic sensation of speed and the immersive atmosphere of traveling through a dense city rather than on any specific object or landmark.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
