Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a vibrant urban environment at night, characterized by glowing neon signs and reflections on wet streets. The focus is on the atmosphere created by the interplay of artificial lights and the reflective surfaces, rather than any specific object. The scene conveys a sense of bustling nightlife and urban energy, emphasizing the scale and ambiance of the city rather than highlighting a particular subject.",
