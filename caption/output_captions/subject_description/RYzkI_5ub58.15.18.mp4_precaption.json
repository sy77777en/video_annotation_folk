Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is an aerial landscape scenery shot focusing on a vast expanse of icebergs floating in dark water. The emphasis is on the environment and atmosphere, showcasing the contrast between the bright white ice and the deep, dark water. The icebergs have irregular shapes, with some featuring smooth surfaces and others having jagged edges. The water appears calm, with a rich, dark hue that highlights the ice's stark whiteness. The video captures the scale and majesty of the natural setting, rather than focusing on a specific object, creating a sense of vastness and isolation.",
