    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is an architectural scenery shot, capturing a low-angle, panning view across the highly ornate facade of a massive cathedral. There is no single main subject, as the camera's deliberate movement across the vast, detailed surface is intended to convey the overwhelming scale and artistic complexity of the entire structure. The focus is on the grandeur of the environment itself, showcasing the building's intricate polychrome marble work in shades of white, green, and pink, set against a brilliant, clear blue sky. The Gothic facade is densely decorated with pointed arches, numerous statues set within elaborate niches, detailed carvings, and large, circular rose windows, creating a powerful impression of historical and artistic significance.",
