    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, capturing a powerful storm moving across a vast canyon. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale of the natural environment and the atmospheric intensity of the weather. Heavy, turbulent clouds, a mix of dark grey and bright white, dominate the sky, and a dense, localized downpour descends into the heart of the canyon, creating a semi-transparent curtain of falling water. The canyon itself is a sprawling vista of layered red and brown rock formations, with sharp, craggy peaks in the foreground and a winding river visible in the distant valley.",
