    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a nature scenery shot, specifically a close-up view of a vibrant green meadow dotted with numerous small, bright yellow buttercups and a few tiny white flowers. There is no main subject because the focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of the flower-filled field, with the camera's shallow depth of field and shifting focus creating a soft, dreamlike quality that emphasizes the collective beauty of the scene rather than singling out any particular flower or element. The gentle sway of the flowers suggests a light breeze, further contributing to the tranquil, natural ambiance.",
