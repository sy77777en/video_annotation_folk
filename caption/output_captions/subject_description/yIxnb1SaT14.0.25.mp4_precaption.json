    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot centered on the illuminated Arc de Triomphe in Paris at night. The grand, neoclassical monument stands at the end of a wet, reflective cobblestone road, flanked by trees with warm, golden foliage under bright streetlights. The scene is brought to life by a time-lapse effect, which transforms the headlights and taillights of passing vehicles into long, flowing streaks of white, blue, and red light, creating a powerful sense of motion and energy. There is no single main subject, as the composition's focus is on capturing the overall atmosphere, scale, and ceaseless vitality of the iconic urban environment.",
