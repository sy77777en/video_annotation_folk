    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.",
    "pre_caption": "A woman in a blue checkered dress quickly moves away from the refrigerator and heads towards a yellow door. She reaches the door and begins to open it. As she opens the door, a man in a yellow sweater and a woman with a pink headscarf, holding a child with a red hat, enter the room. The woman in the blue dress turns to face the newcomers as they fully enter the room.",
