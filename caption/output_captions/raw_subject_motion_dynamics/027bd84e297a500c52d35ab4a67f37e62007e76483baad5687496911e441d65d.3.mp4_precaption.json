    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.",
    "pre_caption": "In the video, a hand enters from the right side and gently taps the top of a set of nested dolls. The dolls remain stationary except for the slight movement caused by the tap. The hand then exits the frame, leaving the dolls undisturbed. The background is plain white, keeping the focus solely on the dolls and the hand interaction.",
