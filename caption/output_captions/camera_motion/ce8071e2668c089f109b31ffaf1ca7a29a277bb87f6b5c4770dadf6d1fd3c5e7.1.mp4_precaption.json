    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet fluid description of the camera movement based on the given details, ensuring clarity and readability. Use active voice and vivid phrasing (e.g., 'the camera arcs around the subject') while naturally integrating translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, and complexity into a cohesive sentence. Avoid robotic lists by weaving details into a smooth narrative (e.g., 'A slow-motion scene filmed at eye level follows the subject as the camera trucks left...'). If the camera is static, specify whether it remains fixed or vibrates. If in motion, describe its type, direction, and speed using precise terms such as tracking, arcing, dollying, trucking, panning, tilting, pedestaling, or rolling, maintaining a natural chronological flow. If movement is fragmented or erratic, summarize succinctly rather than detailing every minor shift. Use the provided human-labeled ground truth directly, making only necessary corrections for typos or grammar without unnecessary paraphrasing.\n\nGeneral Policy: If the camera is static, state that it is fixed, with or without vibration. If it moves, describe the type of movement, direction, and speed, specifying movements such as tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis). Distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in temporal order (e.g., \u201cThe camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject\u201d). If motion appears fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small movement (e.g., \u201cThe first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern\u201d).\n\nUse the provided human-labeled ground truth directly in your description without inferring any additional details. Include all given information, but keep the description concise.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is arcing counterclockwise.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject while arcing around them..\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking",
    "pre_caption": "The camera smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the subject, maintaining a steady and fluid motion as it tracks them without any shaking.",
