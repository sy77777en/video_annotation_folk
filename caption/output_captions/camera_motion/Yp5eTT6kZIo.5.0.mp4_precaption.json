Remember that:\n1:  \"dolly forward/backward\" motion is equal to \"move forward/backward\" motion.\n2: \"smooth\" is equal to \"minimal shaking\"\n\nFirst: \"The camera dolly moves forward slowly, maintaining a very subtle shaking motion.\"\nSecond: \"The camera dolly moves forward with a very smooth and steady motion.\"\n\n- Answer \"Yes\" if everything stated in the second sentence must be true based on the first, even if the first sentence contains additional details.  \n- Answer \"No\" only if the second sentence introduces something uncertain or contradicts the first sentence.\n\nReturn only \"Yes\" or \"No\".",
