    "pre_caption": "This video presents a scenic, wide aerial shot of a large, calm body of water, likely a lake or reservoir, at either dawn or dusk. A long, narrow spit of land extends into the water, with numerous small boats docked along its length and on a nearby islet. The tranquil scene is captured under a soft, cloudy sky tinged with pink and purple hues, with a hazy, distant shoreline visible in the background. The camera maintains a relatively static high-angle view, with only very subtle movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject motion. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences. ",
