He takes a couple of steps forward and to his right, continuing to turn his body in that direction, and briefly touches his left hip. He then faces a woman in a blue jacket, gesturing with his right hand as he looks at her. The man in the white t-shirt to his right remains relatively still, smiling towards him. The woman in the blue jacket gestures with her left hand while speaking. Other people in the mid-ground and background are mostly standing or walking slowly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject is a light-skinned man with short, dark brown hair, a short beard, and tattoos on his left forearm, wearing a bright yellow and green long-sleeved jersey with a large white \"tld\" logo and matching yellow shorts; he also has a pair of red, white, and blue goggles with text, worn backward around his neck. He is interacting with several other people. To his right, a light-skinned man wearing a black baseball cap backward, sunglasses, a white t-shirt with a black graphic, light-colored shorts, and a black wrist brace, is smiling towards the main subject. A light-skinned woman with blonde hair, wearing a bright blue zip-up jacket over a black top and a white knit beanie, appears to be speaking and gesturing towards the main subject. Nearby, a light-skinned man in a black t-shirt, a black backward baseball cap, and a black backpack looks on. Further in the mid-ground, other individuals include a man in a blue collared shirt, jeans, and a light-colored cap; a man in a green long-sleeved shirt and a yellow cap, possibly holding a camera; and another man in a bright green long-sleeved shirt and dark shorts. Many other people are visible in the distant background on a hillside.**",
