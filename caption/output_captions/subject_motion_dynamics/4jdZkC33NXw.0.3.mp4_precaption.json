    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a wet street on a rainy day, with houses and greenery on both sides. The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing more of the street and the buildings on the right side, including a white building with a garden in front. As the camera continues to move, parked cars on the right side of the street come into view, including a silver car and a red car. The camera further pans to show more parked cars and houses in the background, with the street still wet from the rain.",
