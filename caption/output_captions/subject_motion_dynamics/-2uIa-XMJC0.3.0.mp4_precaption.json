    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a woman standing prominently on a skateboard in an indoor setting. She is wearing a white hat and light-colored clothing, with short hair. The woman appears to be in a relaxed stance, facing forward. Behind her, there is a display of skateboards mounted on the wall, adding context to the environment. The lighting highlights the woman and the skateboards, suggesting a focus on skateboarding or a related activity. Additionally, a drone-like device appears in the air later in the video.**",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of an indoor skate park, featuring a wooden ramp in the foreground and various skateboards and equipment in the background. The camera gradually zooms in on a woman standing on the ramp, who is wearing a white hat and light-colored clothing. As the camera gets closer, the woman remains stationary, looking forward. The background includes a neon sign that reads 'BRING ON THE NIGHT' and several skateboards mounted on the wall. The woman continues to stand on the ramp, maintaining her position as the camera focuses on her.",
