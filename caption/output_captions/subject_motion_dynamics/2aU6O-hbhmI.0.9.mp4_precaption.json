    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a cityscape at sunset, featuring a tall, modern building with many windows and a construction site with cranes and other buildings in the background. The camera then starts to tilt upward, gradually revealing more of the sky and the cranes above the buildings. As the camera continues to move upward, the cranes become more prominent, and the sky takes up a larger portion of the frame. The video concludes with the cranes and the sky dominating the view, with the buildings slightly blurred in the background.",
