    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a dense forest covering a mountain slope, with clouds partially obscuring the peaks. As the camera moves forward, a winding road becomes visible, cutting through the forest and leading up the mountain. The sky is partly cloudy, with patches of blue visible through the clouds. The camera continues to move forward, providing a broader view of the forested mountain and the road snaking through it.",
