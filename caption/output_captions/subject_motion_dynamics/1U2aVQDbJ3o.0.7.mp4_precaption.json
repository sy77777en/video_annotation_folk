    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a sandy surface, which is then disturbed and starts to lift into the air, creating a cloud of dust. As the dust continues to rise, the camera angle shifts slightly, revealing more of the sandy terrain and the increasing amount of dust being thrown into the air. The dust cloud becomes denser and more widespread, obscuring the view of the ground beneath. The camera continues to move, showing the dust cloud spreading further and the sandy landscape becoming less visible. The dust cloud starts to settle slightly, but the visibility remains low due to the persistent dust particles in the air. The video concludes with the dust cloud still present, but the sandy terrain becoming more discernible as the dust begins to settle.",
