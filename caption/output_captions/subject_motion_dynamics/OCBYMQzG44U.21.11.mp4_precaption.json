    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a tiled room with white and dark walls, featuring two vertical lights on the wall. The camera then pans to the right, revealing a spiral staircase with metal railings. As the camera continues to move, it focuses on the staircase, showing it descending into a pool of water below. The final frames provide a clear view of the spiral staircase and the pool, with the water surface appearing to ripple.",
