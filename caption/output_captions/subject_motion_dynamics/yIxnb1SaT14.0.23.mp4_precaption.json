People are seen walking up and down the stairs in front of the cathedral, creating a dynamic scene. The camera gradually moves upward, capturing more of the cathedral's structure and the surrounding environment. The text 'MATHIEU STANI\u0106' and 'CINEMATOGRAPHE' appears in the bottom right corner throughout the video.",
