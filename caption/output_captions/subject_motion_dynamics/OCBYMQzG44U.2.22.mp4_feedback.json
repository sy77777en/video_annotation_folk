    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot with a slow, deliberate camera movement. The camera starts at water level and gradually pulls back and tilts upward. This motion slowly reveals the full extent of the surreal and empty environment.\n\nThe scene is a long, narrow, enclosed space, like a corridor or channel, filled with dark, rippling water. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in small, off-white or pale green tiles, creating a sterile and monotonous texture. Rows of bright, square lights are embedded in the ceiling, casting a stark, slightly greenish glow that reflects off the tiled surfaces and the water. At the far end of the corridor, a doorway and what appear to be steps leading out of the water are visible, adding to the liminal and slightly unsettling atmosphere of the location.",
