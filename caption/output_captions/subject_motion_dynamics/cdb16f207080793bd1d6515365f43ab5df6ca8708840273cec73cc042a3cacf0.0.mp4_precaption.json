    "pre_caption": "This is a scenic aerial shot of a city harbor at dawn or dusk. The calm water is filled with numerous fishing boats, some clustered in groups and others anchored alone. In the background, a modern city skyline with several prominent skyscrapers rises against a hazy sky, creating a striking contrast between the traditional maritime activity and the urban development.\n\nThe camera slowly ascends, offering an expanding view of the harbor. Most of the boats are stationary, bobbing gently on the water. A few small boats can be seen moving slowly across the bay.",
