    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a double rainbow arching over a forested area with a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees, some of which have autumn foliage. As the camera moves upward, the rainbow remains prominent, and the tops of houses and trees become less visible. The camera continues to ascend, revealing more of the landscape, including a road with moving vehicles and a distant town. The rainbow remains the central focus as the camera reaches a higher altitude, showing a broader view of the surrounding area, including fields and more trees.",
