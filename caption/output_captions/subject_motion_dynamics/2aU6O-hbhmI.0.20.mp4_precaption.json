    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up view of a tall building with a red brick facade and large glass windows, capturing the details of the balconies and the interior lights. As the camera moves, it starts to tilt and shift, gradually revealing more of the surrounding buildings and the cityscape in the background. The camera continues to rotate, providing a broader view of the urban environment, including other high-rise buildings and construction cranes. The perspective shifts further, showing the building from a different angle, with the camera now capturing the lower part of the building and the street below.",
