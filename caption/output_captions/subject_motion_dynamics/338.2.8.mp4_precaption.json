    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject\u2019s motion and dynamics, followed by the second\u2019s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a complex focus transition in a dining setting. Initially, the subject is a woman with medium-length dark hair, glasses, and a light brown skin tone, wearing a yellow patterned top and holding chopsticks over a plate of food. The focus then shifts to a man with glasses wearing a maroon shirt. Following this, it transitions to a woman with long dark hair and glasses, dressed in a maroon vest over a black top. Finally, the focus is on a woman with glasses, wearing a maroon vest with gold trim over a white shirt, and her name tag reads \"Susan.\" She has a light brown skin tone and is holding chopsticks in front of a plate with green vegetables. A glass of iced tea is visible on the table. The transitions between individuals occur smoothly, suggesting a deliberate shift in focus.**",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a woman in a yellow patterned top holding chopsticks and eating from a plate of food, with a glass of iced tea in front of her. The camera then pans to the right, revealing a man in a maroon shirt also holding chopsticks and eating. As the camera continues to move, it shows another woman with long dark hair and glasses, wearing a maroon vest over a black top, eating from her plate. Finally, the camera focuses on a woman with glasses, wearing a maroon vest with gold trim over a white shirt, who is also holding chopsticks and eating from her plate. The background features a dimly lit restaurant with traditional decor, including a large painting on the wall and a hanging lantern.",
