    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a snow-covered road flanked by a wooden house on the right and a forest of tall pine trees in the background. A car is parked near the house, and the roof of the house is covered with snow. The camera slowly pans to the right, gradually revealing more of the snowy landscape and the forest. As the camera continues to move, the house moves out of the frame, and the focus shifts entirely to the snowy road and the forest in the background.",
