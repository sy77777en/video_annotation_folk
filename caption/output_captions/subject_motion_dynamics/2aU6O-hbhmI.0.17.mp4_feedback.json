The camera moves closer to the building, capturing more details of the structure, including the balconies and windows. As the camera continues to approach, the lighting from the building's lights and the setting sun becomes more prominent. The camera angle shifts slightly, revealing more of the building's side and the surrounding area. Finally, the camera focuses on a specific balcony where two people are standing, visible against the backdrop of the building and the sunset.",
