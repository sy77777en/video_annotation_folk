    "pre_caption": "This is a static or very slowly moving scenic shot. The camera captures a breathtaking high-angle view of a historic walled city on a peninsula, surrounded by the deep blue sea. The city is a dense cluster of buildings with iconic orange-tiled roofs, enclosed by formidable stone fortifications. A small harbor with numerous boats is visible on the left, and a lush, green island can be seen in the distance. The vantage point is a rocky, verdant hillside, with a cable car pylon prominent on the right.",
