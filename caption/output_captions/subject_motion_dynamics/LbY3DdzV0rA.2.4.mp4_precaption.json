    "pre_caption": "This is a time-lapse video that captures the rapid movement of a storm system.\n\nThe video shows a dramatic, wide-angle view of a massive storm over a flat, arid landscape. The sky is filled with turbulent, ominous clouds glowing in shades of orange and brown, likely from a sunset or dust in the air. A prominent, lower cloud formation, resembling a shelf cloud, stretches across the scene, with curtains of heavy precipitation or dust falling beneath it. In the distance, the silhouette of mountains is visible against the stormy sky.",
