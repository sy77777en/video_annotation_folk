    "pre_caption": "The video shows a concrete road curving to the left, flanked by lush green fields on both sides. The sky is partly cloudy with large, fluffy clouds scattered across it. There are several utility poles and wires running parallel to the road on the left side. In the background, there are small hills and a few buildings, including a green-roofed house near the center of the frames. The camera moves steadily forward along the road, maintaining a consistent view of the landscape and the road ahead.",
