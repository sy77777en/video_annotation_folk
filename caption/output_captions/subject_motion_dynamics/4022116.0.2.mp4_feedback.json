The choppy, green water of the canal is flanked by historic Venetian buildings with terracotta roofs, and several boats, including a water taxi and a larger public vaporetto, are visible. The pan concludes with a view of the vaporetto docked at the \"Salute\" station, with the grand, white-stone Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute and its wide steps in the background.",
