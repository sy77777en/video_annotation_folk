    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video is presented in a split-screen format, displaying two distinct scenes simultaneously. On the left, a young woman with fair skin and dark hair with bangs is shown in a dark blue police uniform, complete with an American flag patch on her sleeve. She is sitting back in a chair with her feet propped up on a desk, holding a red rotary telephone to her ear while speaking. Her police hat rests on her lap. On the right, a scene unfolds in a bathroom where a middle-aged man with short brown hair, wearing a yellow argyle sweater over a collared shirt and tie, stands while talking on a light blue telephone with a distressed expression. To the left of the man, there are three people: a woman on the far left wearing a bathrobe with a pink towel wrapped around her head, revealing some dark hair; another woman with blonde hair in a pink checkered dress and slippers, positioned between the first woman and the man; and a child with brown hair and a red hat, whose hands are clasped together on the counter as if in prayer. Both women are moving around anxiously and seem to be supporting the child. In the background, another person with dark hair peeks out from behind a striped shower curtain, wearing a white collared dress shirt and a black tie, looking at the group.**",

On the right, a man in a yellow sweater stands and gestures with one hand while speaking into a blue telephone. In the bathroom with him, a woman in a checkered dress leans over a child at the sink, while another woman in a bathrobe moves anxiously behind them. A person's head emerges from behind a shower curtain in the background to observe the scene.",
