The camera gradually zooms in on the sleds, which are green, yellow, red, and blue, and are positioned next to a wooden post and a lantern. As the camera continues to zoom in, a snowplow starts to appear from the right side of the frame, moving towards the house. The snowplow becomes more visible, clearing the snow in front of the house.",
