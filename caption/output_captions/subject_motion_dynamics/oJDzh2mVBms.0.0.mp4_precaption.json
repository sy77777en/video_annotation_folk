    "pre_caption": "This scenic video captures a serene, snowy landscape at twilight. A snow-covered road or field leads toward a distant line of silhouetted evergreen trees. The sky displays a beautiful gradient, shifting from a warm orange glow at the horizon to a deep, dark blue above, where a single bright planet or star is prominent.\n\nThis is a time-lapse shot. The sky slowly darkens as night falls, and the stars, including the bright planet, appear to move across the frame. The landscape itself remains static throughout the clip.",
