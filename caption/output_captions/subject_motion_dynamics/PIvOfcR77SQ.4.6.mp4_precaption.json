    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a clear blue sky filled with scattered white clouds. As the camera moves downward, the top of a snow-covered dome structure starts to appear at the bottom of the frame. The camera continues to pan down, revealing more of the dome and the surrounding area, which includes additional snow-covered structures and trees in the background. A car partially buried in snow becomes visible as the camera moves further down, showing more of the snowy landscape and additional dome-like structures. The camera continues to pan right, revealing a wider view of the snowy area with multiple dome-like structures and a car fully buried in snow. The video ends with a full view of the snowy landscape, showing several dome-like structures and the car, with the sky still visible in the background.",
