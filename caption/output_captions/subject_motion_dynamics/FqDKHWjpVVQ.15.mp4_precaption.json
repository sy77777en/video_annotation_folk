    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video displays a first-person perspective from a video game. A dark firearm, held by unseen hands, is visible at the bottom of the screen. A heads-up display overlays the view, featuring a blue minimap in the lower left, a kill feed in the center-bottom showing text like \"cloudedtruth [QBB-95] ViciousBambi\" and \"ENEMY KILLED 100\", and an ammunition counter in the lower right displaying \"71/101\". An enemy character, a soldier figure in dark, possibly camouflaged, combat gear and a helmet, is briefly seen running near a set of grey metal stairs with black railings. In the wider view, a large, black railing structure is prominent against a hazy, light-colored sky, with light-brown or beige, possibly concrete, building walls and some green foliage also visible. Red and orange diamond-shaped objective markers with numbers like \"74\" and \"20\" appear on screen, indicating points of interest or enemy locations.**",
    "pre_caption": "The player, holding a dark firearm, moves forward, passing under a set of metal stairs with black railings. The kill feed continues to display enemy kills, and the player's ammunition count remains at 71/101. As the player ascends the stairs, more enemy markers appear, and the player aims their weapon upwards. The player reaches the top of the stairs, revealing a wider view of the area, including a large, black railing structure and more green foliage. The player continues to move forward, with the kill feed still showing enemy kills, and the environment becoming more visible, including additional structures and more distant foliage.",
