    "pre_caption": "This is a time-lapse video showing a dramatic thunderstorm. The movement of the clouds and the light trails from cars on the highway indicate the passage of time.\n\nThe scene captures a powerful storm over a vast, open landscape at dusk. Two parallel highways stretch towards the horizon, which is illuminated by a warm, orange glow. Above, the sky is dominated by a massive, turbulent formation of dark purple and blue storm clouds, with sheets of rain visible in the distance. Brilliant flashes of lightning periodically illuminate the clouds from within, casting a dramatic pink and purple light across the sky.",
