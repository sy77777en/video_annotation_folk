    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A stylized, light-skinned cartoon hand holds a black smartphone horizontally. The phone's white screen displays a series of interactive educational lessons from an app, starting with its logo, the word \"Brilliant,\" which is initially written in green ink following the stroke order before changing to black text. The content on the screen then cycles through various animated and interactive modules. An initial module is labeled \"Exterior Angles.\" Another module demonstrates gear rotation with blue, grey, and yellow gears. A different module shows a diagram related to pattern recognition, with shapes connected to a grid where a diagonal line is being drawn. A lesson on probability lists topics like \"Uniform Probabilities\" and \"Intro to Simulation.\" Another module displays a scatter plot with a blue parabolic curve and interactive sliders, followed by a multiple-choice question about the model. A lesson illustrates GPS location with a graphic of the Earth and a satellite's signal sphere. A final example shows a scatter plot demonstrating \"Mean Squared Error\" with data on penguin weight versus bill depth. A cursor arrow is visible interacting with the on-screen elements, such as sliders and buttons.**",
    "pre_caption": "A stylized cartoon hand holds a smartphone, on which the word \"Brilliant\" is written in green before turning black. The screen then displays a series of animated lessons. First, a blue gear rotates, causing a smaller yellow gear to spin as a cursor adjusts a slider. Next, a cursor clicks on a grid to draw a diagonal line of black squares. The view changes to a lesson plan, where the cursor selects a topic. Subsequently, on a scatter plot, a cursor drags two sliders, altering the shape of a parabolic curve. This is followed by a graphic of the Earth, where a purple sphere representing a satellite signal expands and contracts as a slider is moved. Finally, on another scatter plot, a cursor drags the endpoint of a line, changing its slope and a corresponding numerical value.",
