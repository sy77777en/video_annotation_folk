    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a top-down view of a spiral staircase in a tiled room, with a small yellow object visible at the bottom of the stairs. The camera then starts to move upward, gradually revealing more of the staircase and the surrounding area. As the camera continues to ascend, the full spiral staircase and the adjacent tiled floor become visible, along with a large circular opening in the ceiling that allows light to illuminate the space. The camera movement reveals more of the room, including a section of the wall with rectangular panels and a light source on the left side. The video concludes with a complete view of the upper part of the room, showcasing the spiral staircase, the tiled floor, and the illuminated ceiling.",
