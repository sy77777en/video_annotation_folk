    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an aerial view of a small island situated in a vast body of water, with a dock extending into the water and several boats moored along it. The camera slowly pans to the left, revealing more of the surrounding water and the distant shoreline. The sky is painted with soft hues of pink and purple, indicating either sunrise or sunset. The island appears to be a small settlement or a fishing village, with a few buildings and structures visible on the dock. The background features a long, narrow landmass stretching into the distance, with mountains faintly visible on the horizon. The water is calm, reflecting the colors of the sky. As the camera continues to move left, the dock and boats remain in view, while the landmass and distant mountains become more prominent.",
