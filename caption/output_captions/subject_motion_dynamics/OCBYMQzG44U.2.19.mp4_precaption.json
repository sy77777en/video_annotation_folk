    "pre_caption": "This video clip presents a static, water-level view from inside a stark, tiled room that resembles a swimming pool. The scene is defined by the contrast between the clean, white-tiled walls and the dark, murky water, with a prominent dark, circular tunnel at the far end. The only movement is the gentle rippling of the water's surface.",
