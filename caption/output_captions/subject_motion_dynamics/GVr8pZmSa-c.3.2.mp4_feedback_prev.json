As the camera gradually moves away, the rocky object remains in the center of the frame, and the surrounding ground becomes more visible. The background is a dark blue sky, and small white particles, possibly snow or dust, are seen floating in the air. The camera continues to pull back, increasing the distance between the viewer and the rocky object, while the floating particles become more noticeable.",
