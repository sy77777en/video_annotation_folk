    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a large tree in the foreground, with the sun setting in the background, casting a warm glow over the landscape. As the camera moves to the right, the tree gradually moves out of the frame, revealing more of the open field and additional trees in the distance. The sunlight continues to illuminate the scene, creating a serene and picturesque atmosphere. The camera continues to pan right, eventually centering on the open field and the distant trees, with the tree now mostly out of view.",
