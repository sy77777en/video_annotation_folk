    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a tiled room with a small arched doorway at the far end, illuminated by a ceiling light. The camera gradually moves closer to the doorway, maintaining focus on it. As the camera continues to move, it starts to pan to the right, revealing more of the room. The room features a black-tiled floor with a white rectangular section in the center, and the walls are a mix of white and gray tiles. The camera completes its pan, fully revealing the room's interior, including another arched doorway at the far end.",
