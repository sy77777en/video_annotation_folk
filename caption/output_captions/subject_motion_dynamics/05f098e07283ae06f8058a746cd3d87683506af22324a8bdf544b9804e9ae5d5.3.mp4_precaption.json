    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a lush, green forest, with dense foliage and tall trees surrounding a waterfall. The waterfall cascades down a rocky cliff into a small, dark brown pool of water at the bottom. Several people can be seen standing near the base of the waterfall, some closer to the water and others on the rocky shore. The camera gradually moves forward, providing a closer view of the waterfall and the surrounding greenery.",
