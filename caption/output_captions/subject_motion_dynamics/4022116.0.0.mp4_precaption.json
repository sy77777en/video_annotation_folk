    "pre_caption": "The video shows a wide canal flanked by historic buildings on both sides, with several gondolas docked along the edges. A boat, labeled 'ALILAGUNA,' gradually moves from the right side of the frame towards the center of the canal. The boat continues to move steadily, creating small ripples in the water as it progresses. The background remains consistent with the historic buildings and the calm water of the canal.",
