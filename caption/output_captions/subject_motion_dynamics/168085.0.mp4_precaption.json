    "pre_caption": "This video consists of a single, static, breathtaking photograph of a natural landscape. There is no movement in the clip.\n\nThe image is a stunning aerial view of Angel Falls in Venezuela, cascading from the top of a massive, flat-topped mountain known as a tepui. The summit of the tepui is covered in vibrant green vegetation and is split by a deep canyon from which the waterfall emerges. The water plummets in a long, slender stream down the immense, sheer cliff face into the dense, verdant rainforest that blankets the valley below and the surrounding mountains stretching into the hazy distance.",
