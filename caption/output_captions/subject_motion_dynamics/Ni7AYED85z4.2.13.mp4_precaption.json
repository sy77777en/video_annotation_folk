A person in a red jacket is seen walking along the right side of the canal, moving from the right side of the frame towards the left. A bird is flying in the sky above the canal, moving from the center towards the top right of the frame. The water in the canal is calm, and the buildings appear to be weathered, with some showing signs of wear and tear.",
