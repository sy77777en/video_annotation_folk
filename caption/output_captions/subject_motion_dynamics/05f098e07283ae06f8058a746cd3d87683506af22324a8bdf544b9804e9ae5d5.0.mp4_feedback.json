    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an aerial view of a dense forest, with tall trees and lush greenery covering the landscape. As the camera moves forward, a waterfall becomes visible in the distance, cascading down a rocky cliff into a small pool below. The waterfall is surrounded by dense foliage, and the water appears to be flowing steadily. The camera continues to move forward, providing a closer view of the waterfall and the pool it feeds into, which is partially obscured by the surrounding trees. The scene remains consistent with the waterfall and pool as the focal points, with the forest providing a serene and natural backdrop.",
