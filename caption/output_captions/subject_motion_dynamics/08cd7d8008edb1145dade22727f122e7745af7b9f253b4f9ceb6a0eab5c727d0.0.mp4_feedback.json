    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a cityscape featuring a prominent bridge with a metal framework, surrounded by tall buildings and power lines. As the camera moves forward, the bridge becomes more prominent, and the details of its structure, including its support beams and towers, are clearly visible. The camera continues to move closer, revealing more of the bridge's intricate design and the vehicles traveling on it. The background includes a river below the bridge and a mix of modern and older buildings. The camera finally focuses on the bridge's central tower and the power lines running parallel to it, providing a detailed view of the bridge's architecture and the surrounding urban environment.",
