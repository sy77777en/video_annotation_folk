    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an aerial view of a cityscape, featuring a prominent building with a dome and a flag on top, surrounded by other buildings and streets. As the camera moves forward, the building with the dome becomes more central in the frame, and the surrounding buildings and streets become more visible. The camera continues to move forward, revealing more details of the adjacent buildings, including a tall spire on the left side of the frame. The camera further advances, showing the intersection of streets with moving vehicles and more buildings in the background. The video concludes with a closer view of the building with the dome and the tall spire, with the surrounding cityscape becoming more detailed.",
