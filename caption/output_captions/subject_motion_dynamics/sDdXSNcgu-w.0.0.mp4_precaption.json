    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A sequence of simple, black-and-white line drawings appears against a plain white background. The first is a stylized human figure with a round head, slanted eyebrows, and a straight mouth, giving it an angry expression. This is followed by a drawing of a sitting cat with pointed ears and a small smile. Next, a character resembling a crewmate from the game *Among Us* is shown, with its characteristic bean-like shape and large oval visor. Subsequently, a cartoonish Tyrannosaurus Rex appears, depicted with a large head, sharp teeth, and small arms. This is followed by a drawing of a short, grinning skeleton wearing a hooded jacket with its hands in the pockets. After that, a small, cloaked figure with a horned head and large, black, circular eyes is displayed. Then, a flower with a wide, sinister grin and black eyes in its center is shown. The final distinct character is a plant-like creature with a large, toothed mouth and wide eyes, which splits apart and then reassembles to transform back into the initial stylized human figure with a round head, slanted eyebrows, and a straight mouth, conveying an angry expression.**",
    "pre_caption": "A sequence of static, black-and-white line drawings of different characters flashes on a white background, with each new character abruptly replacing the last. The final character, a clam-like creature, briefly splits its top and bottom halves apart before they morph and merge to reform the first character shown, an angry human figure.",
