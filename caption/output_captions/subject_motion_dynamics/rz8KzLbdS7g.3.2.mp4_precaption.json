    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a narrow street lined with a brown fence on the left and a blue house on the right, with power lines and a clear blue sky in the background. As the camera moves forward, the blue house on the right gradually moves out of the frame, revealing more of the street and the houses ahead. The camera continues to move forward, showing a wooden house with a white roof and a garden in front, as well as a car parked under a carport on the right. The camera approaches the wooden house, providing a closer view of its facade and the surrounding greenery. The video ends with a close-up of the wooden house, highlighting its detailed structure and the well-maintained garden.",
