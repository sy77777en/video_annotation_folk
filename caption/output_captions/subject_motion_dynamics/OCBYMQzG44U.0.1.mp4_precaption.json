    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a small pool of water on the right side of a tiled floor, with white walls and columns in the background. As the camera moves forward, the pool gradually moves out of the frame, revealing more of the tiled floor and the water surface. The camera continues to move forward, showing the water surface becoming more prominent and the pool area almost completely out of view. The camera finally focuses on the water surface, with the white columns and the illuminated background becoming the main focus.",
