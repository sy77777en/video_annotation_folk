    "pre_caption": "This video features a brief panning shot across a canal. The scene is set in Venice, Italy, on what appears to be an overcast day. The choppy, green water of the canal is flanked by historic Venetian buildings with terracotta roofs, and several boats, including a water taxi and a larger public vaporetto, are visible. The pan concludes with a view of the vaporetto docked at the \"Salute\" station, with the grand, white-stone Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute and its wide steps in the background.",
