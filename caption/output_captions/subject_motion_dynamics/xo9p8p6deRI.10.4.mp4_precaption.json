    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video displays a grayscale, low-polygon 3D animated scene. In the middle ground, a low-polygon, grayscale man stands to the left of a light-colored, low-polygon SUV, which appears to be an older model Ford Bronco. The man is facing slightly to his right, which is the left side of the frame, with his right arm raised and bent, his hand near his head as if holding a phone or gesturing, while his left hand is at his side, possibly in his pocket. The driver's side door of the SUV is open. Inside the SUV, the head and shoulders of another low-polygon, grayscale figure are visible, seated inside the vehicle. The SUV has a spare tire mounted on its rear, and a \"Ford\" logo is discernible on the tailgate. On the far right, the front portion of a second, light-colored, low-polygon vehicle is partially visible. The background consists of low-polygon, grayscale trees and a low fence.**",
    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a close-up view of a low-polygon, grayscale man standing next to an open car door of a light-colored SUV, with the man appearing to be in a conversation or gesturing. As the camera gradually moves backward, the man remains in the same position, and the interior of the SUV becomes more visible, showing the seated figure inside. The camera continues to pull back, revealing more of the surrounding environment, including the trees and the low fence in the background. The second vehicle on the right side of the frame becomes more visible as the camera moves further back, but the focus remains on the man and the SUV.",
