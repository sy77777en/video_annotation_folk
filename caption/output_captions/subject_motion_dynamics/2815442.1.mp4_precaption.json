    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide view of a large lake surrounded by forested hills and mountains under a clear blue sky. As the camera moves forward, a boat appears on the left side of the lake and starts moving across the water, creating ripples behind it. The boat continues to move towards the right side of the frame, leaving a trail in the water. The camera keeps moving forward, capturing the boat as it progresses further across the lake. The boat becomes smaller in the distance as the camera continues to move forward, showing more of the lake and the surrounding landscape. The video ends with the boat almost out of sight, and the camera still moving forward, providing a broader view of the lake and the scenic surroundings.",
