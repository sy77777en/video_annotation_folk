    "pre_caption": "The video shows a dilapidated corridor with yellowish walls covered in graffiti and broken windows on the right side, allowing sunlight to filter in. The floor is littered with debris and rubble, and the walls are in a state of disrepair. As the camera moves forward, the debris and broken structures become more prominent, and the corridor appears to be leading to a brighter area at the end.",
