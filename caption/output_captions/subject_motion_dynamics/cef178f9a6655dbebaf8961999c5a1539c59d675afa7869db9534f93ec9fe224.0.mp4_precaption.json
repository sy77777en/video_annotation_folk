    "pre_caption": "This video captures a low-angle, ground-level view of a bustling street in what appears to be London, England. The camera remains stationary as various vehicles, including cars, a black cab, a red double-decker bus, and a tour bus, drive past. The street is framed on both sides by tall, elegant, historic buildings under a bright blue sky, with a Union Jack flag flying from one of the buildings on the right.",
