    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a narrow alleyway between two buildings, with a traditional house featuring a red-tiled roof and wooden structure in the background. As the camera moves forward, the house becomes more prominent, and two posters on the wall in front of the house come into view. The camera continues to move closer, providing a clearer view of the posters, which appear to be campaign posters with images and text. The camera finally stops, focusing on the posters and the house, highlighting the details of the posters and the surrounding greenery.",
