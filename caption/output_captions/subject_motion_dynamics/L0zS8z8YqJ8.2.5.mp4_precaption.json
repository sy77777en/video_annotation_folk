    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video presents an aerial, diagonal view of a long, light gray passenger train car moving towards the upper right corner of the frame, while the camera remains stationary relative to the train. Initially, the roof of the train car is opaque, featuring small, evenly spaced, square-like indentations. The sides of the car are a darker gray or blue-gray, with multiple small, rectangular windows, and black lines demarcate the divisions between car sections. The roof then becomes transparent, revealing the detailed internal layout. The interior consists of numerous compartments, including narrow corridors, small private rooms (some equipped with bunk bed-like structures and fixtures resembling sinks or toilets), and larger communal areas. These communal spaces are furnished with small, dark gray, circular tables and L-shaped seating. The internal walls are primarily white or light-colored, while the flooring varies between a light brown or wood-like material and gray. Shadows of trees and the train are visible on the ground, suggesting that the sunlight is coming from the upper left corner. The train car is shown against a blurry, textured background of green and brown, indicative of land.**",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an aerial view of a train car moving diagonally from the bottom left to the top right of the frame, with the camera remaining stationary. The train car's exterior is initially opaque, featuring small, evenly spaced, square-like indentations on the roof. As the car moves, the roof gradually becomes transparent, revealing the detailed internal layout. The internal structure includes narrow corridors, small private rooms with bunk bed-like structures, and larger communal areas with circular tables and L-shaped seating. The background remains consistent with a blurred, textured mix of green and brown, suggesting a natural landscape.",
