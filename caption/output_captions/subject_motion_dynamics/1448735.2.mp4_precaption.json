    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a dense forest, featuring tall trees with thick trunks, lush green foliage, and moss-covered rocks scattered on the forest floor. As the camera moves forward, a narrow dirt path becomes visible, winding through the forest. The path is surrounded by dense vegetation, including ferns and various undergrowth plants. A small stream appears on the left side of the path, with water flowing gently over rocks and through the forest. The camera continues to move forward, revealing more of the stream and the surrounding forest, with the path curving slightly to the right. The scene remains consistent with the dense forest and the stream, with the camera maintaining a steady forward motion.",
