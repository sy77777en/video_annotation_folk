    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a dark passageway leading to a brighter area at the end. As the camera moves backward, the passageway becomes more visible, revealing a person sitting inside. The camera continues to pull back, showing the passageway from a wider perspective, and the surrounding stone walls and greenery start to come into view. The camera moves further back, revealing the full view of the stone building with ivy-covered walls and multiple windows. The building is situated on a cliff, with the sea visible on the left side and more greenery on the right. The camera continues to pull back, providing a broader view of the cliffside building and its surroundings, including the coastline and distant landscape.",
