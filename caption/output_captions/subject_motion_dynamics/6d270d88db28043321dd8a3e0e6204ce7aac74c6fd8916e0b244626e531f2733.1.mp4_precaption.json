    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an aerial view of a large body of water, with several small islands scattered across the surface. A small peninsula extends into the water, where numerous boats are docked along the shore. The background features a vast, green landmass that stretches out to the horizon, under a sky with a soft, pastel-colored hue. As the camera moves, the perspective slightly shifts, providing a broader view of the landscape, including more details of the islands and the docked boats.",
