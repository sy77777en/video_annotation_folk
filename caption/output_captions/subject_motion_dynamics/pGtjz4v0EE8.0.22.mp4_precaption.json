    "pre_caption": "This is a scenic aerial shot of a historic town, likely San Gimignano in Tuscany, Italy, perched on a lush, green hill. The town's skyline is defined by its numerous medieval towers, and it is surrounded by a classic landscape of rolling hills, vineyards, and forests under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds.\n\nThis is a static scenery shot. The camera performs a slow, smooth forward glide, gradually approaching the hilltop town from a distance.",
