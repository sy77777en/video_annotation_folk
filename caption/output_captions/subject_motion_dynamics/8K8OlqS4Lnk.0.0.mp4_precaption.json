The rainbow is clearly visible against a backdrop of trees and power lines. As the camera continues to move, more of the rainbow and the surrounding environment come into view, including additional trees and power lines. The camera then reveals a street scene with houses and a fence, while the rainbow remains prominent in the sky.",
