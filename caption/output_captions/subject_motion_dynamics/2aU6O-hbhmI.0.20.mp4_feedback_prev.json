As the camera moves, it starts to tilt and shift, gradually revealing more of the surrounding buildings and the cityscape in the background. The camera continues to rotate, providing a broader view of the urban environment, including other high-rise buildings and construction cranes. The perspective shifts further, showing the building from a different angle, with the camera now capturing the lower part of the building and the street below.",
