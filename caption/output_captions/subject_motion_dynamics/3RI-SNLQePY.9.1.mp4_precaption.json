    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a first-person perspective, a pair of hands in primarily black gloves with red accents are visible. The left hand holds an orange, rectangular device with a large, orange, hook-shaped antenna; the device's screen displays yellow signals and a portrait of a man with dark hair and sunglasses. The right hand is shown making a middle finger gesture and mimicking a shooting gesture. Initially, in the center of the scene, a white, spherical entity labeled \"CYBEHOLDER\" floats while enveloped in a crackling purple energy field, which dissipates later in the video. The entity occasionally moves to the center-left of the scene and features a circular opening capable of emitting red lasers. In the background, several large screens display various images: three show an anime-style woman with long dark hair in a kimono, another shows a stylized man with a large black afro and a distorted face, and a fifth displays a gun and Japanese text. Game interface elements, including a \"BATTERY LIFE\" bar and a \"RELOAD\" prompt, are also present.**",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a white, spherical entity floats and bobs in the center of a room while enveloped in crackling purple energy. A right hand transitions from a middle finger gesture to a pointing gesture, and a white flash emanates from the fingertip. Immediately after, the purple energy field around the entity vanishes as a small red explosion appears on its surface, causing it to recoil slightly before it resumes floating and bobbing in the air.",
