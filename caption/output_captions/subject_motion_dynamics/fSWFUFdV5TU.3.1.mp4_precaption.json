As the camera moves backward, more of the room becomes visible, including a table with a lamp, a framed picture, and a small decorative item. The camera continues to pull back, revealing a bench with a pair of shoes on the floor next to it. The room is decorated with two framed pictures on the walls, one on the left and one on the right, and a small table with a lamp and other decorative items on the left side.",
