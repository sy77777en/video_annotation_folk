    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a top-down view of a spiral staircase in a tiled room with a pool below. The camera then starts to pan left, moving away from the staircase and revealing more of the tiled floor and walls. As the camera continues to move, it shows a wall with three oval-shaped windows, allowing light to enter the room. The camera finally settles on the wall with the windows, focusing on the tiled floor and the wall's texture.",
