    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a sunset sky, with the sun partially visible on the horizon, casting a warm glow over the scene. The camera moves forward along a path that runs parallel to a railway track, with buildings on both sides of the path. The buildings are dark silhouettes against the bright sky, and there are trees visible in the background. The camera continues to move forward, maintaining a steady pace, and the railway track remains in the center of the frame. The sky's colors shift slightly as the camera progresses, but the overall scene remains consistent with the setting sun and the buildings lining the path.",
