    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a large, ornate building with a dome and arched windows, surrounded by a busy square filled with people walking and gathering. As the video progresses, the lighting changes from daylight to dusk, and the building and square become illuminated by artificial lights. The scene transitions to nighttime, with the building and square brightly lit, and people continuing to move around. The video then returns to daylight, showing the building and square as they were initially, with people still present in the square.",
