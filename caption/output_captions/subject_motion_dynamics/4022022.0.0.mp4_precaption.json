    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an aerial view of a roof under construction, showing plywood sheets, a ladder, and various tools on the ground. The camera moves forward, revealing more of the roof and construction materials scattered around. As the camera continues to move, it shows a worker's equipment and tools placed on the roof. The camera then captures ropes and wooden planks on the roof, indicating ongoing construction work. The camera moves further, showing the transition from the newly installed plywood to the old, weathered wooden roof structure. The old wooden roof, with visible wear and tear, is shown in detail as the camera continues to move. The video ends with a broader view of the old, damaged wooden roof and the surrounding grassy area.",
