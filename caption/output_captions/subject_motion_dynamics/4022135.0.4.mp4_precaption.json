    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video, filmed from a spectator's viewpoint in an outdoor sports stadium, initially shows several people in the foreground. Most prominent is a man with light skin, wearing a grey hooded sweatshirt and a dark green baseball cap, viewed from his left rear as he watches the game. Beside him are other spectators, including one in a white baseball cap and another in a dark collared shirt, while a person with a purple hat is seated in front. The camera then pans left, transitioning to a wider shot of the American football game in progress. The green field is marked with white lines, a white \"N\" at the center, and large white lettering spelling \"WILDCATS\" on a purple background in the end zone. The white goalposts stand prominently on the field. Numerous football players in contrasting uniforms are visible as small figures on the field. The surrounding stands are densely packed with a large crowd, many wearing purple and gold attire. A distinctive, light-colored, multi-story building inscribed with \"RYAN FIELD\" is visible at the beginning but disappears from view once the camera pans. Tall floodlight towers are also visible. The pan concludes by showing more of the expansive field and the crowded opposite stands.**",
    "pre_caption": "The camera, initially stationary with a view from the stands, pans to the left. This movement shifts the perspective from a close-up of spectators in the foreground to a wide shot of the football field, revealing players gathered near the end zone and the large crowd in the opposite stands. The pan concludes by holding on this expansive view of the stadium.",
