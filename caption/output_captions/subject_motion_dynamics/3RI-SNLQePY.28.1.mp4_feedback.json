    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A stylized, animated character with a detached head is depicted sitting behind a reddish-brown bar, which functions as a table. The character's head is a brown, bird-like mask resembling that of a plague doctor, complete with two small antlers, and it floats just above the neck of a body wearing a teal collared shirt. The character's visible arm is dark and segmented, holding a white mug. A thought bubble appears next to the character's head, containing geometric shapes, including two triangles, a quarter-circle, and a rod. Above the character is a long, light-colored rectangular machine that dispenses objects selected by the cursor. This machine displays a row of five simple drawings: a tooth, a crescent moon, a spider, two biscuits, and an acorn. A white arrow cursor moves across the screen, interacting with the symbols on the machine. More icons sit on top of the reddish-brown bar at the bottom; these include a cluster of buildings, a backpack, and an eyeball.**",

It then moves upwards towards a machine at the top of the frame where icons of a tooth, crescent moon, spider, buscuits, and an acorn are. There is a brown nozzle underneath each of these icons, at the bottom of the machine. The cursor seems to select the spider icon then tap the outlet beneath it, and a question mark drops out of the nozzle and falls down. The cursor then repeats the proces of moving over and clicking a symbol and then tapping the nozzle biscuit for the crescent moon and tooth symbol, with the cursor clicking the nozzles multiple times for the crescent and tooth and making multiple question marks fall out. The video ends after the cursor moves towards the right and is about to click the nozzle under the biscuits symbol. ",
