    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an aerial view of the Liwa Desert in the United Arab Emirates, showing the winding road and the surrounding sand dunes. The text 'LIWA Desert, United Arab Emirates' appears on the screen and then fades away. The camera gradually zooms in on the road, following the off-road vehicle as it drives along the path, leaving a trail of dust behind it. The vehicle continues to move forward, navigating the curves of the road, with the dust trail becoming more pronounced. The camera maintains its focus on the vehicle, capturing its movement and the dust trail it creates as it progresses along the road.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a succinct yet clear description of the subject\u2019s motion throughout the video, making sure to list any distinct actions **in the order they occur** (for instance, \u201cThe bird first hops onto a branch, then flutters its wings, and finally glides to the ground\u201d). Refer to it only as \u201cThe video,\u201d since it encompasses the first and last moments of the footage, and present the entire sequence of movement in one continuous narrative rather than splitting it by frames. Concentrate on how the subject moves, without reiterating details already mentioned in the human-written description. Do not include anything not directly visible or confirmed on screen. Write in plain, straightforward English, avoiding emotional or subjective adjectives, as well as any speculative language (e.g., \u201cit seems,\u201d \u201cit might\u201d). If there is no movement, mention this briefly.\n\nPlease focus solely on what happens in the video. Omit any details about the subject\u2019s appearance unless it is absolutely necessary to differentiate multiple subjects. Avoid using abstract phrases such as \u201cthe vehicle shows great agility,\u201d and instead specify the actual motion (e.g., \u201cthe vehicle drives along the road\u201d).\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video showcases a vast desert landscape with undulating sand dunes in shades of golden brown. A prominent feature is a winding road cutting through the dunes. An off-road vehicle is seen traveling along this road, creating a trail of dust as it moves. The car appears small in comparison to the expansive desert.**",
