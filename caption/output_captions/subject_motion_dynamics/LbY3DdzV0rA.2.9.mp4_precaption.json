The sky is filled with turbulent, roiling clouds colored in deep purples, grays, and bright whites, illuminated from within by flashes of lightning. In the distance, rain can be seen falling against a backdrop of silhouetted mountains and the last light of sunset. The clouds move and churn rapidly, showcasing the storm's evolution.",
