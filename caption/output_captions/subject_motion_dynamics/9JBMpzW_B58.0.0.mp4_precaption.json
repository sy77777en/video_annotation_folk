    "pre_caption": "This is a stunning timelapse video of the night sky as seen from the bow of a large ship at sea. The sky is a breathtaking canvas of countless stars. A vibrant green aurora, possibly the aurora borealis or australis, dances and shimmers along the horizon beneath a layer of clouds. The timelapse effect causes the stars, clouds, and the ethereal glow of the aurora to sweep across the frame at an accelerated speed.",
