    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A group of men walks together. In the foreground, a tall man on the right with dark hair wears a black coat. To his right, a man in a black coat over a white collared shirt is speaking. Next to him is a man in a blue suit with a green tie and a beard. On the far left, a man with long, dark, wavy hair, wearing a dark blue blazer over a light blue shirt, holds his hand to his mouth. In the background, other men accompany the group, and a small child in a red sweater is visible among them.**",
    "pre_caption": "A group of men walks forward in a procession along a paved path between two buildings. The man in the center, wearing a black coat, speaks as he walks, while the men on either side of him walk alongside. A tall man in a black coat on the right walks steadily, and a man with long hair on the left walks with his hand near his mouth. Other men and a small child follow behind the main group.",
