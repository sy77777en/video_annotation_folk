The man on the right, wearing a conductor-style uniform, holds a black, crook-handled staff in front of him. He then swiftly raises this staff directly upwards above his head with both hands in a decisive, vertical motion. Concurrently, the man on the left, wearing a Santa hat and holding a tan bag, turns his body away from the camera and takes a step or two backward, moving towards the rear of the compartment as the other man completes the action of raising the staff.",
