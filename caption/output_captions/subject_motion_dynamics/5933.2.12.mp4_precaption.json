As the camera moves to the right, more of the room becomes visible, revealing intricate wooden paneling and carvings on the wall. The camera continues to pan right, showing a detailed wooden structure with an arched opening and additional carvings. As the camera moves further, a large, ornate wooden carving with a central emblem and flanking figures comes into view.
