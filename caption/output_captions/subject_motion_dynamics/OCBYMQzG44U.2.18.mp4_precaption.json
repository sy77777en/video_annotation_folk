    "pre_caption": "This is a static, low-angle shot from the surface of dark, murky water inside a large, tiled room. The walls are covered in small, pale green tiles, and the ceiling is illuminated by a row of bright, square lights. In the background, a large, dark, circular tunnel opening is partially submerged, and to the right, a set of white stairs leads up to a simple doorway, creating a sterile and unsettling, liminal atmosphere.",
