    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a serene park featuring a stone pathway, lush green trees, and vibrant red foliage near a calm pond. As the camera pans left, more of the pond and the surrounding rocks come into view, with the reflection of the sky and trees visible on the water's surface. The camera continues to move left, revealing additional buildings in the background, which are illuminated by the warm light of the setting sun. The scene concludes with a full view of the pond, the rocks, and the buildings, all bathed in the golden hues of the sunset.",
