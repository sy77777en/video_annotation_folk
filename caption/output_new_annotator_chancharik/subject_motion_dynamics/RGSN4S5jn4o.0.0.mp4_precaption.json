    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video opens with a city street scene, initially focusing on a man crossing the sidewalk. He is dressed in a light green shirt and jeans, with short dark hair and no beard. The street features a checkerboard pattern, which transforms into an irregular design of lines and squiggles as the man crosses. The camera then shifts to two individuals on the opposite side of the street. One is an animated woman with pink hair, wearing a long green dress adorned with a flower design. The other is an animated person wearing a pink jacket and holding a phone. Both animated characters have a stylized, cartoonish appearance, contrasting with the realistic setting. A yellow taxi is visible on the road, and colorful flowers are displayed on the sidewalk.**",
    "pre_caption": "The man in the light green shirt and jeans walks across the sidewalk, moving from one side of the checkerboard-patterned crosswalk to the other. As he progresses, the pattern beneath him changes into an irregular design of lines and squiggles. After he crosses, the camera shifts focus to the opposite side of the street where two animated characters appear. One character, a woman with pink hair and a long green dress, walks forward while the other character, wearing a pink jacket and holding a phone, follows closely behind. Both animated figures continue walking along the sidewalk, maintaining a steady pace. Meanwhile, a yellow taxi drives past on the road, and people can be seen walking and standing near the colorful flower displays on the sidewalk.",
