    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a snowy landscape with tall evergreen trees flanking a snow-covered path. The camera transitions to a close-up, first-person point-of-view shot, highlighting a person's hand resting on the black steering handle of a sled or similar vehicle. The individual is dressed in a dark jacket, with only small portions of their black shoes and pants visible. The sled features a metallic frame with tracks clearly visible in the snow, suggesting movement along the path. The scene effectively conveys a sense of winter activity in a forested area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a first-person POV, showcases a snowy outdoor setting during the day. The scene features a snow-covered road flanked by tall evergreen trees, creating a serene winter landscape. The ground is blanketed in fresh, white snow, with visible tracks indicating recent movement. A snowbank lines the left side of the road, adding to the wintry atmosphere. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene. In the foreground, a hand grips the steering wheel of a sled or similar vehicle, suggesting motion along the snowy path. The overall environment is calm and expansive, with the natural beauty of the snow and trees dominating the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide-angle view of a snowy landscape, capturing a snow-covered path flanked by tall evergreen trees. The path occupies the center of the frame, extending into the background, while the trees are positioned on both sides, creating a corridor-like effect. Snowbanks line the left side of the path, situated in the middle ground. As the video progresses, the perspective shifts to a first-person point-of-view, focusing on a hand gripping the black steering handle of a sled. This hand is located in the bottom left of the frame, with the steering handle extending towards the center. The metallic frame of the sled is partially visible in the bottom right, with tracks in the snow indicating forward movement. The camera remains at the subject's height throughout, maintaining a consistent angle that emphasizes the path ahead and the immediate surroundings. The transition from the wide landscape to the close-up view of the sled smoothly shifts the focus from the broader environment to the specific action of steering through the snowy terrain.",
