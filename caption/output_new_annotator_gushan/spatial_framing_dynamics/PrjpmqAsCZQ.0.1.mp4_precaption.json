    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium build and light skin tone. He is wearing a dark bandana, a light-colored jacket, and a dark shirt with a visible graphic or text. In one part of the video, he is standing and facing sideways, while in another, he is facing forward and gesturing with his hand near his head. The setting appears to be dimly lit, with a greenish tint, suggesting night vision or low-light conditions. The man\u2019s expression is neutral, and he is the central focus throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting with a dimly lit environment, using night vision to create a unique green hue. The room resembles a studio or control room, equipped with electronic devices like speakers and monitors. Dark walls and minimal lighting contribute to a shadowy atmosphere. A person moves through the space, interacting with the equipment, emphasizing the theme of technology and sound. Positioned centrally, the individual engages with the environment in harmony with the music's rhythm. The overall ambiance is quiet and focused, with the night vision effect enhancing the distinct visual style.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of the man, capturing him from the waist up as he stands in the center of the frame. He is positioned in the foreground, with electronic equipment such as speakers and monitors in the background, slightly out of focus. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium close-up, focusing more closely on the upper half of his body. Throughout the sequence, the man remains in the center of the frame, moving slightly as he gestures with his hands near his head. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's height, keeping the man as the central focus against the dimly lit backdrop of the room. The spatial arrangement keeps the equipment consistently in the background, reinforcing the setting's technological context.",
