    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a woman with short blonde hair in a blue plaid dress standing in front of a yellow door, seemingly calling over a family. A woman in a light-colored dress and pink headscarf enters first, followed by a man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants, who gently places his hand on her back. A child in a colorful patterned outfit and red hat then joins them. As the yellow door opens, another woman with dark hair, wearing a white blouse and dark skirt, is visible in the background, greeting them warmly. The scene captures a lively and warm interaction among the group in an indoor setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set in a brightly lit, vintage-style kitchen, featuring a yellow door and patterned wallpaper that create a warm, nostalgic atmosphere. A cream-colored refrigerator with rounded edges, typical of mid-20th-century appliances, stands out prominently. When the yellow door opens, sheer white curtains in the adjoining room are visible, suggesting a cozy home environment. Daylight gently filters through the windows, softly illuminating the space. A vase with blue and white flowers adds a touch of color and freshness. The scene captures a moment of activity, with several people interacting near the door, enhancing the lively and homely ambiance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of the subjects, capturing them from the waist up. Initially, a woman in a blue plaid dress stands in the foreground, centered in the frame, facing the yellow door in the middle ground. She is positioned slightly to the left. As the scene progresses, a woman in a light-colored dress and pink headscarf enters from the left side, moving into the foreground. A man in a mustard yellow sweater follows, entering from the left and positioning himself behind the woman in the pink headscarf, also in the foreground. He gently places his hand on her back. A child in a colorful outfit and red hat then joins them, moving into the foreground from the left. In the background, the yellow door opens, revealing another woman in a white blouse and dark skirt, who is positioned further back in the scene, near the doorway. The cream-colored refrigerator is situated on the right side of the frame, in the middle ground. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. The spatial arrangement shifts as new characters enter, filling the foreground while keeping the yellow door and the background elements in view.",
