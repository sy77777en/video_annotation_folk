    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens with a vibrant city street scene, seamlessly blending real and animated elements. A Black man dressed in blue enters from the right, crossing the street as a paint can falls onto the crosswalk, prompting a zoom-in with creative hand-drawn doodles outlined in white. The camera pans from right to left, pausing on a young woman with pink hair, holding a small white animal in her right arm, and wearing a yellow top and pants with a mid-length green coat, as she waits to cross the street. As she begins to cross, the camera moves forward, capturing a man in a white shirt and tie, and another man in a yellow cap and jacket, following her. Upon stepping onto the hand-drawn crosswalk, the woman and the traffic light gradually transform into animated figures, along with the man in the yellow jacket. This dynamic and colorful urban environment enhances the visual appeal of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of an urban street scene during the day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a city street lined with modern buildings of varying colors, including beige, red, and blue. The road is marked with a distinctive black-and-white checkered pattern at a crosswalk. A yellow taxi is visible on the street, adding to the urban atmosphere. Sidewalks are bordered by planters and a variety of colorful flowers, contributing to a lively environment. The weather is clear, with no visible precipitation. Overlay elements include artistic, animated characters and brush tool options on the right side, suggesting a creative or augmented reality interface. These overlays are not part of the physical scene but add a layer of visual interest and interaction.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot of a city street, capturing a broad view of the scene. The Black man in blue enters from the right foreground, moving towards the left. As he crosses the street, the camera remains at his level, maintaining a consistent perspective. The crosswalk, initially a black-and-white checkered pattern, transforms into a hand-drawn design as the man walks over it. The camera then pans from right to left, transitioning to a full shot that centers on a young woman with pink hair in the middle ground. She stands near the left side of the frame, holding a small white animal in her right arm. As she begins to cross the street, the camera follows her movement forward, keeping her in the center of the frame. A man in a white shirt and tie appears behind her in the middle ground, followed by another man in a yellow cap and jacket. The camera continues to track the woman as she steps onto the hand-drawn crosswalk, where she and the man in the yellow jacket gradually become animated figures. Throughout the sequence, the camera remains at the subjects' level, ensuring a continuous and immersive perspective. The urban backdrop, including buildings, a yellow taxi, and flower-lined sidewalks, stays consistently in the background, providing context",
