    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a cluttered kitchen countertop with various items. A black coffee maker is prominently positioned near a window, which has a few small bottles on the sill. The countertop is scattered with a sliced orange bell pepper, a partially eaten sandwich, and a crumpled plastic bag. There is also a dark-colored bottle and a metal basket nearby. The scene is dimly lit, with light filtering through the window, highlighting the disarray of the kitchen items.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor kitchen setting during the daytime, characterized by a cluttered countertop beneath a window. The scene includes a coffee maker, a bottle, and various kitchen items scattered across the surface, such as a sliced orange bell pepper, a plastic bag, and remnants of food. The window, partially fogged and streaked with water, allows diffused light to illuminate the area, casting soft shadows. The countertop is made of a smooth material, and the overall atmosphere suggests a lived-in, slightly untidy space. The lighting and arrangement of objects remain consistent, emphasizing the everyday nature of the environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a cluttered kitchen countertop, capturing the entire scene without focusing on specific subjects. The black coffee maker is centrally located in the middle ground, positioned near the center-left of the frame. To its right, in the foreground, lies a sliced orange bell pepper, a partially eaten sandwich, and a crumpled plastic bag. These items occupy the lower right portion of the frame. In the background, a window spans the upper middle section, with small bottles placed on its sill. A dark-colored bottle and a metal basket are situated to the left of the coffee maker, in the middle ground. The countertop extends horizontally across the frame, with all objects resting on its surface. The camera remains at the subject's level, providing a direct view of the scene. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positions throughout the video. The lighting from the window casts soft shadows, enhancing the visibility of the objects' placement.",
