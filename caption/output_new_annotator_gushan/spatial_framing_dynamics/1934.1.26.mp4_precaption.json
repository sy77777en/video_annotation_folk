    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows five people dressed in full-body white suits with orange stripes along the sides. They all wear white hoods that completely cover their heads, obscuring any facial features. One person stands out by wearing a tall red top hat. Four of them are closely gathered around a small black rectangular screen mounted on a white structure. They appear to be intently focused on the screen\u2014some leaning in, others standing upright. The fifth person stands with their back to the group. The scene conveys a strong sense of collective attention centered on the screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a minimalist, monochromatic environment with white walls and geometric structures. A group of people, dressed in white outfits with orange stripes, are gathered closely around a small black screen mounted on the wall. One individual stands out with a distinctive tall red top hat, adding a splash of color to the otherwise muted scene. The group is intently focused on someone manipulating a small white human figure in front of the screen. Meanwhile, another person, standing slightly apart with their back to the group, appears to be operating something. The lighting is bright and evenly distributed, highlighting the stark contrast between the white surroundings and the black screen. The overall atmosphere is clean, modern, and filled with a sense of curiosity and focused observation.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of five individuals in white suits with orange stripes, focusing on their interactions around a central object. The camera captures the subjects from the waist up, allowing a clear view of their upper bodies and actions. The four individuals gathered around the black screen are positioned in the center of the frame, with two on the left side and two on the right. Their 2D positions vary slightly, with some leaning forward and others standing more upright, while they remain in the foreground. The person wearing the red top hat is centrally located among the group. The fifth individual, who stands with their back to the group, is positioned on the far right side of the frame, also in the foreground. This person faces away from the camera, creating a distinct separation from the main cluster. The camera maintains a steady height at the subjects' level throughout the sequence, ensuring consistent visibility of their upper bodies and interactions. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the video. The minimalist background remains constant, providing a neutral setting that emphasizes the subjects' actions.",
