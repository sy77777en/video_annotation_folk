    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a woman and a man seated close together, possibly in a convertible car. The woman has short, curly black hair, light skin, and is dressed in dark clothing with a colorful scarf. Her gaze is directed slightly upward, maintaining a neutral expression. The man, with short black hair and light skin, wears a dark jacket over a light-colored shirt. Both appear to be engaged in conversation, occasionally glancing around. In the final moments, the man looks directly at the woman with a focused expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor nighttime scene with two individuals standing close together. The setting is dimly lit, with shadows cast by nearby trees, suggesting a residential area. The background includes a glimpse of a building with visible architectural lines, possibly a house. The individuals are positioned in the foreground, with one wearing a patterned scarf, adding a touch of color to the otherwise dark environment. The lighting is subtle, highlighting their faces against the shadowy backdrop, creating a contrast between the illuminated subjects and the obscured surroundings. The atmosphere is calm, with no visible movement or weather elements affecting the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of two individuals, a woman and a man, positioned side by side in the foreground. The woman is on the left side of the frame, while the man is on the right. Both are facing slightly upward, indicating they may be looking at something above eye level. The woman remains mostly stationary throughout the sequence, her gaze fixed in the same direction. The man, however, shifts his head slightly, eventually turning to look directly at the woman. The background consists of dimly lit trees and part of a building, which remain static and out of focus, emphasizing the subjects in the foreground. The camera maintains a consistent level, capturing the subjects from the chest up, and there are no noticeable changes in shot size or camera height. The overall spatial framing keeps the subjects centrally aligned, with the woman on the left and the man on the right, throughout the sequence.",
