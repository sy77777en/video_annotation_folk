    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a person's silhouette in the center foreground, framed within a dark, pointed archway. In the middle ground, a large, textured, conical stone structure is centered, flanked by reddish-brown walls on the left and right. As the person moves forward, the camera, positioned at their level, tilts upward. This motion causes the stone structure to fill more of the frame, revealing its full dome shape, while the top of the archway moves out of the frame, exposing the bright sky at the top. The person remains stationary in the center foreground relative to the frame throughout the camera's upward tilt.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a person with short, dark hair, seen from behind, walking toward a large, ancient architectural structure. Due to the lighting, the person's features and clothing are not clearly visible, but they appear to be wearing a dark jacket. The structure, prominently made of textured stone with a dome-like shape, is flanked by reddish-brown walls. The video begins with a wide shot, capturing the person as they approach the structure, emphasizing the scale and grandeur of the architecture. The focus remains on the interaction between the person and the structure, highlighting the contrast between the human figure and the imposing, historical edifice.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot showing a character from shoulder height, set in an outdoor environment. Initially, the character is in a dark space and then walks out towards a large, dome-shaped structure made of dark, textured stone, positioned centrally. The character exits through an opening with two vertical sides and a top that converges to form a point, resembling a pentagon shape. The structure is flanked by two angular walls with a reddish hue, creating a stark contrast against the stone. The setting appears to be during the day, with bright light illuminating the top of the dome, highlighting its rough texture and subtle color variations. The overall atmosphere is minimalistic, with the focus on the geometric shapes and contrasting colors of the stone and walls.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person walking toward an ancient architectural structure. It begins with a wide shot of the surrounding, while the camera tracks the person from behind. The video only shows the upper body of the person, leaving more context for the architectural structure.\n\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively describes the camera's upward tilt and the resulting shift in focus from the person to the architecture. However, the initial shot description is slightly contradictory; a \"wide shot of the surroundings\" would not typically be described as \"focusing on their upper body,\" which implies a tighter medium shot. It would be more accurate to describe it as a medium-long shot that includes the person's upper body and a significant portion of the environment. A key element, the \"archway,\" is mentioned as moving out of the frame but is completely absent from the initial scene description, leaving the viewer to guess its starting position. It should be introduced at the beginning, likely framing the top of the shot. Furthermore, the description of the person remaining in the \"center foreground\" is imprecise during the upward tilt; \"bottom-center of the foreground\" would more accurately reflect their position as the camera moves. Finally, the phrase \"This provides more context for the architectural structure\" is an interpretation of intent rather than a neutral observation and should be removed to maintain objectivity.",
