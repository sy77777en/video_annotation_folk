    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a silhouetted scene. A large, donut-shaped object is positioned in the bottom-center foreground, with a smaller object to its left. A dark hill occupies the bottom-right foreground, set against a misty, gray background. The scene briefly transitions to a colorful view where a silhouetted figure on the bottom left shines a light, illuminating a pink donut in the center, surrounded by green grass and flowers on a slope. The video then cuts back to the dark setting, where a small, silhouetted human figure now stands in the bottom-left foreground, to the left of the large, donut-shaped object, which is now in the center-right foreground. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a silhouetted scene with two primary subjects. On the left, there is a large, round object resembling a wheel or a ring, standing upright on its side with the hole visible. It appears solid and dark against the misty background. To the left of this object, a small human figure is visible. This figure is also silhouetted, with glowing eyes that stand out against the dark form. Initially lying down, the figure, which appears to be a child based on its size and proportions, stands up, runs over to the large object, and takes a bite out of it. The background is a misty, grayscale landscape with indistinct shapes, creating a mysterious atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is a third-person 2D side-view gaming video where the camera follows the character from a lateral perspective. It begins in a dark, foggy outdoor environment with a silhouetted donut-shaped object on the ground. As the character moves, areas illuminated by their flashlight become brightly lit, revealing a pink donut covered in sprinkles, flowers, and green grass. The video ends with the character standing next to the donut-shaped object in the dark, foggy environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the human figure's position is ambiguous; stating the figure is \"to its left\" initially and then \"now stands to the left\" after the transition fails to describe any clear movement or change in relative position. The claim that the illuminated pink donut is \"in the center\" during the colorful sequence is likely inaccurate, as it contradicts the statement that the donut \"remains in the bottom left\" and that the shot is a static wide shot. The caption is confusing the donut's role as the central point of visual interest with its actual spatial position within the frame. Furthermore, the description of depth could be more explicit by identifying the donut and figure as being in the middle ground, with the hill further back and the mist in the background. A better caption would clarify the figure's initial position (e.g., \"in the far bottom left\") and then describe their specific movement to a new position (e.g., \"moves to stand directly beside the donut\"), while maintaining that the donut's position in the bottom left of the frame is constant throughout the video.",
