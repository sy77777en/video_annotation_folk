    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot features a young man positioned in the center-left of the frame, occupying the middle ground. In the foreground, the out-of-focus shoulder of a second person frames the right side of the shot. A dark, indistinct background with graffiti-style drawings is visible behind the main subject. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the framing remains static throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young Black man with a short, high-top fade hairstyle is shown in a close-up, looking down with a focused and slightly concerned expression. He is wearing a blue denim varsity-style jacket with a striped, ribbed collar over a red shirt. A pair of headphones with a thin wire rests around his neck. To the right, the blurry, out-of-focus shoulder and side of another person are partially visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This close-up shot takes place in a dimly lit room with a dark, cluttered background. The wall behind the subject is adorned with out-of-focus, graffiti-style drawings, one of which resembles a stylized face. The scene is cast in a warm, yellowish-green light, creating a dark atmosphere. In the foreground, the out-of-focus shoulder of another person frames the right side of the shot.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subject, foreground element, and background, establishing a clear sense of depth. However, the description of the shot size as a \"close-up\" might be inaccurate; if the man's shoulders and upper chest are visible, \"medium close-up\" would be more precise. The caption is missing a crucial detail: the camera's height, which appears to be at the man's eye level, creating a natural, conversational perspective. While the camera's movement is noted, the description feels mechanical. A more fluid description, such as \"the camera drifts in a subtle arc,\" could better capture the handheld, organic feel of the shot. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention if the main subject moves at all; even a slight lean or turn of the head would be a key spatial dynamic to include, contrasting with the camera's own motion. Finally, stating the background is \"indistinct\" could be improved by specifying that it is \"out-of-focus,\" which more accurately describes the visual effect of a shallow depth of field.",
