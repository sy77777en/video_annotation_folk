    "pre_caption": "This is a stationary wide shot of an interior architectural scene. The composition is framed from a low camera angle, emphasizing the vastness of the empty, tiled room. A tiled wall occupies the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, while the tiled floor covers the bottom half. A curved portion of the right wall is prominent in the right foreground. Along the top right, a row of square ceiling lights recedes into the background. In the background, a bright vertical light source is positioned slightly left of center, with a dark, arched entryway to its right. A metal railing stands in the middle ground on the right, in front of the entryway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an interior architectural scenery shot of a vast, empty, and sterile tiled room. The walls, floor, and ceiling are all covered in a grid of small, off-white square tiles, giving the space a uniform and slightly disorienting quality under a pale, greenish-yellow glow cast by a row of recessed ceiling lights. In the distance, a bright vertical slit of light cuts into a far wall, contrasting with a small, dark, arched entryway guarded by a simple metal railing. The shot deliberately lacks a main subject, instead using the wide, distorted perspective to emphasize the immense scale, eerie emptiness, and liminal atmosphere of the environment itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place inside a long, empty room entirely surfaced with small, square, pale green tiles, creating a uniform grid pattern across the floor, walls, and a curved ceiling. The space is lit by a row of square lights embedded in the ceiling and a bright light source from an opening in the distance. Toward the back of the room, a short section of metal railing stands before a dark, arched doorway. The wide-angle perspective makes the walls appear to curve inward.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the key architectural elements and their final positions, it could more effectively describe the dynamic nature of their reveal. The description of the camera movement as \"moves forward and pans to the right\" is a bit generic; a more precise description, such as \"arcs smoothly to the right,\" would better capture the fluid motion. The caption misses the opportunity to describe the initial framing before the movement begins, which I imagine starts with the curved right wall in the foreground obscuring most of the background. The feedback could be improved by detailing how this curved wall moves from the right foreground toward the center before receding, acting as a curtain that reveals the arched entryway and the vertical light source behind it. Additionally, the caption states the final positions of the elements but doesn't describe their movement relative to the camera; for example, it could mention that as the camera pans, the left tiled wall slides out of the frame while the metal railing slides in from the right. Finally, the phrase \"emphasizing the vastness\" is an interpretation; this could be conveyed more objectively by describing the scale, such as how the distant entryway appears small in the final wide framing of the room.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a stationary wide shot of an interior architectural scene, initially framed with the curved right wall in the foreground, obscuring much of the background. As the camera arcs smoothly to the right, this curved wall moves from the right foreground toward the center, gradually revealing the arched entryway and the bright vertical light source slightly left of center. The tiled wall on the left side of the frame extends from the foreground into the middle ground, but as the camera pans, it slides out of the frame, while the metal railing slides in from the right, positioned in front of the entryway. The tiled floor covers the bottom half of the frame, and a row of square ceiling lights recedes into the background along the top right. The final wide framing of the room highlights the scale, with the distant entryway appearing small, emphasizing the room's vastness.",
