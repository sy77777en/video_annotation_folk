    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot. The main subject, a woman, is positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground, facing towards the right side of the frame. Partially visible on the far left is another person in the middle ground. On the right side, another person's hand is partially visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. The framing remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the video, a woman with light skin and dark hair pulled back is shown from the chest up, facing towards the right and looking slightly upwards. She wears a headset with a microphone positioned near her slightly open mouth. Her attire is a dark, patterned uniform featuring gold-colored insignia on the collar points. Partially visible behind her on the left is another person wearing a camouflage uniform with a circular patch on the upper sleeve. In the background on the right side of the frame, behind the woman, another individual's hand is partially visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set within a dimly lit indoor environment, with low lighting creating deep shadows in the background. A woman wearing a dark, patterned uniform adorned with insignia and a black headset is positioned facing slightly towards the right, aligning with the right side of the background. Partially visible behind her is another individual in dark attire, and on the far left, a segment of another uniform featuring a patch can be seen. The surrounding area is mostly obscured by darkness, with a subtle reflection hinting at a possible screen or monitor located to the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the main subject as being in the \"middle ground\" of a \"close-up shot\" is contradictory; for her to be in the middle ground, a prominent foreground element would need to be present and described, which the caption omits. If no such element exists, she should be classified as the foreground subject. The description of the other people is too vague; specifying what parts are visible, such as \"the shoulder and back of a head\" on the left or \"the fingers of a hand holding a glass\" on the right, would provide more concrete visual information. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention the depth of field, a key aspect of spatial framing. A more effective description would note that the main woman is in sharp focus while the other elements in the frame are blurred, which would better justify the use of \"middle ground\" and \"background\" and clarify the visual hierarchy. Finally, stating that the second person on the far left is also in the \"middle ground\" seems unlikely if they are out of focus; their relative depth should be described more precisely in relation to the main, focused subject.",

On the right side, the fingers of a hand holding a glass are partially visible in the background, also blurred.
