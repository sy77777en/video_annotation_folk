    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot of a Japanese street corner. Initially, a red taxi is in the center middle ground, driving from right to left on a road that occupies the lower half of the frame. A dark pole stands in the left foreground. In the background, a green hedge lines the road, with a mix of traditional and modern buildings and trees behind it. The camera pans left, following the red taxi as it moves to the left side of the frame, which brings a black car and a white car into view in the middle ground. The camera then tilts upward, causing the street to move to the bottom of the frame and bringing a large blue overhead road sign into the center. The final shot frames the sign in the upper half, with the tops of the background buildings below it and a cloudy blue sky filling the top. The camera is positioned at eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot from a street corner in Japan under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. A red taxi drives along a paved road lined with green hedges and trees, while a white truck is parked on the roadside in the background. Modern apartment buildings and traditional Japanese-style structures are visible in the background. As the camera pans left to follow the red taxi, a black sedan and a white car come into view, trailing behind the taxi. The camera then tilts upward to focus on a large blue overhead road sign, which provides directions in both Japanese and English for destinations such as Otsu, Yamashinahigashino, and Shimogamo, along with route numbers. The focus of the shot is on the overall urban environment and the sense of place, rather than on any single vehicle or building. The camera's upward movement from the bustling street to the directional sign emphasizes the location and atmosphere of this specific intersection.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A daytime street scene unfolds in a Japanese city under a bright blue sky with large, white, puffy clouds. On a paved two-way road, a red and white taxi drives from right to left. The street is lined with a manicured green hedge, which partially obstructs the view of oncoming vehicles. As the camera pans left to follow the red taxi, a black car and a white car become visible, driving behind it. Behind the hedge stand a mix of buildings, including a one-story restaurant with a green tiled roof and modern, multi-story grey and white structures. The view tilts upward, revealing a large blue overhead road sign with white Japanese and English lettering, indicating directions and route numbers against the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the main camera movements and subject transitions, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and composition. For instance, the description of the red taxi in the \"center middle ground\" is vague; specifying that it drives in the lane closest to the camera would clarify the depth. As the camera pans left, the caption fails to mention that the dark pole in the left foreground would swiftly move across the frame and exit on the right, a significant spatial effect. The introduction of the black and white cars is also abrupt; the caption should clarify if they are parked along the curb or are also in motion, and their position relative to the red taxi. Furthermore, the transition from pan to tilt could be described more fluidly, noting whether the red taxi has already exited the frame when the tilt begins. Finally, stating the camera is at \"eye level\" is an oversimplification; while it may start there, the final shot is a distinct low-angle shot looking up at the overhead sign, and this change in relative angle is a key aspect of the shot's dynamic.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a wide scenery shot of a Japanese street corner. A red taxi drives in the lane closest to the camera, moving from right to left across the lower half of the frame. A dark pole stands prominently in the left foreground but quickly moves across the frame and exits on the right as the camera pans left. This pan reveals a black car and a white car in the middle ground; both are in motion, following the red taxi. As the red taxi exits the frame, the camera smoothly transitions from a pan to a tilt upward, shifting the street to the bottom of the frame and bringing a large blue overhead road sign into the center. The final shot captures the sign in the upper half, with the tops of the background buildings below and a cloudy blue sky above. The camera starts at eye level but ends with a distinct low-angle perspective, emphasizing the sign's prominence against the sky.",
