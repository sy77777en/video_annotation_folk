    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle medium shot, a man is positioned in the right foreground, seen from behind. He walks down a staircase, moving away from the camera toward the center of the frame and into the middle ground. The staircase, with its ornate railings on the left and right, frames his descent toward the dimly lit landing in the background. The camera remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit, dark setting, a man is seen from behind as he walks down a staircase. He is wearing dark, possibly black, long-sleeved clothing, and his form appears as a silhouette. Due to the low lighting and the angle, no further details of his appearance are discernible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit interior, a person's silhouette is seen from behind as they descend a wide staircase. The environment is dark, with a cool, greenish color cast. The staircase features dark, ornate metal railings with a repeating lattice pattern. The light source appears to be from the lower level, faintly illuminating the steps and the landing below, while the upper area remains in deep shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the high-angle perspective and the camera's forward and downward tilting motion, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and composition. Stating the man is in the \"foreground\" is likely inaccurate; given he is on a staircase viewed from above, the railings themselves would occupy the immediate foreground, placing the man in the middle ground. The description of a \"medium shot\" is also static, whereas the man's movement away from the camera would cause the shot to transition from a medium shot into a medium-long or long shot by the time he reaches the landing. Furthermore, while the caption mentions the railings frame his movement, it could be more descriptive by specifying that they form converging lines, creating a strong sense of depth and guiding the viewer's eye toward his destination in the background. Finally, the caption doesn't clarify if the man is already moving at the start of the shot or begins his descent from a stationary position, a detail that would better define the initial spatial arrangement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a high-angle shot, the camera captures a man positioned in the middle ground, seen from behind as he begins his descent down a staircase. The ornate railings, occupying the immediate foreground, form converging lines that guide the viewer's eye toward the dimly lit landing in the background, enhancing the sense of depth. As the man moves away from the camera, the shot transitions from a medium to a medium-long or long shot. The camera remains static throughout, capturing the man's movement from a stationary start at the top of the stairs.",
