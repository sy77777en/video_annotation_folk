    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a yellow soccer ball positioned in the bottom right foreground. In the middle ground, an out-of-focus red cleat is visible to the left of the center, while a bright light shines in the top left background. The shot transitions to a close-up as a second red cleat enters from the left and moves toward the center to kick the ball. At the moment of impact in the center of the frame, the ball is propelled out of the shot to the right. The camera remains in a close-up, now focusing on the player's feet, with the planted left foot in the bottom left and the kicking right foot suspended in the center of the frame after its follow-through. The camera maintains a low position, level with the subjects, throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on a close-up of a yellow and black Nike soccer ball, covered in water droplets, resting on green artificial turf. The ball has the word \"STRIKE\" and a black Nike swoosh visible. A red-orange Nike soccer cleat with a silver swoosh then enters the frame and kicks the ball in slow motion, causing the water to splash dramatically. The focus is on both the person's feet and the soccer ball during the kick. Once the soccer ball leaves the frame, the focus shifts entirely to the person's feet, showing a pair of the red-orange cleats and black socks. One foot is planted on the ground while the other, the kicking foot, is suspended in the air after the follow-through.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a green soccer pitch at night, illuminated by bright overhead lights against a dark background. A yellow and black Nike soccer ball, covered in water droplets, rests on the turf. A foot wearing a bright red cleat with a silver swoosh makes contact with the ball in slow motion, causing water to spray from its surface upon impact.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively details the shot sizes and the 2D/3D positions of the subjects, it creates some confusion regarding the identity and movement of the soccer cleats. The initial description of an \"out-of-focus red-orange soccer cleat\" in the middle ground, followed by the \"same red-orange cleat\" entering from the left, is contradictory; it's more plausible that the initial out-of-focus element is the player's *plant* foot (which I imagine is a different color, perhaps black) already positioned, while the red-orange kicking foot is the one that enters the frame for the action. The description of the camera's \"brief clockwise arc\" is placed at the end as a summary, but it would be more descriptive to integrate this movement into the action sequence, specifying that the arc occurs simultaneously with the kick to dynamically follow the foot's swing. Furthermore, the caption misses an opportunity to describe the mechanism of the transition from medium shot to close-up—whether it's a quick zoom or a dolly-in. Finally, for a ground-level close-up, mentioning the texture of the surface, such as individual blades of green grass being kicked up upon impact, would add a valuable layer to the spatial dynamics.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium shot of a yellow soccer ball positioned in the bottom right foreground.
