    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot captured in a wide shot from a low-angle perspective, positioned close to the ground. Initially, the polished, checkered floor occupies the bottom half of the frame, extending from the immediate foreground into the middle ground. The walls, lined with large paintings, are on the left and right sides of the frame, while the ornate ceiling is at the top. In the center background, an elaborate altar is visible, with a grand piano to its left. The camera then moves steadily forward, gliding smoothly across the floor. This forward dolly shot causes the altar and piano in the background to become larger and more detailed as they transition towards the middle ground, while the camera maintains its low height throughout the movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot capturing the opulent interior of a grand, baroque-style hall. The camera glides smoothly over a highly polished, checkered marble floor that reflects the ornate surroundings. The walls are adorned with large, dramatic paintings in dark, gilded frames, set above rich wood paneling, while a lavishly decorated ceiling with a central fresco adds to the sense of grandeur. At the far end of the long hall stands an elaborate white marble altar featuring a central statue. There is no single main subject in this video; the focus is intentionally placed on the environment itself, using a wide-angle perspective and slow movement to emphasize the immense scale, rich detail, and solemn atmosphere of the architectural space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A slow forward movement captures the interior of a grand, opulent hall with a highly polished, patterned marble floor that reflects the surroundings. The lower walls are lined with dark wood paneling, while the upper sections feature large, framed oil paintings. The ornate, coffered ceiling is adorned with a central fresco. At the far end of the long room stands an elaborate marble altar with a central statue. To the left of the altar is a black grand piano, and a wooden bench sits in front of it. Light enters through several windows, supplementing the interior illumination.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the initial wide shot and the forward dolly movement, but it misses key dynamic visual details and makes a potentially inaccurate assumption. While it mentions the polished, checkered floor, it completely omits the prominent reflections of the ornate ceiling and the large paintings that would be visible on its surface; the movement of these reflections during the dolly is a significant spatial effect. The description of the walls is also too static; as the camera moves forward, the paintings closer to the camera in the foreground would move past and exit the frame, a crucial perspective shift that isn't mentioned. Furthermore, describing the camera as \"eye level\" seems questionable; a camera \"gliding smoothly across the floor\" is more likely positioned at a lower, chest-level height to enhance the sense of scale and the receding perspective of the floor's pattern. Finally, the term \"altar\" is very specific; if the space is a concert hall or ballroom, which the grand piano suggests, \"dais\" or \"stage\" would be a more fitting and neutral term for the raised structure in the center background.",
