    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a large white airplane is positioned in the foreground, centered in the top half of the frame. Below the aircraft, an illuminated airport runway is situated in the center of the middle ground, with lit airport buildings visible to the left. The entire scene is set against a dark background. The camera is initially positioned below and behind the airplane. As the airplane descends towards the runway, the camera follows, maintaining its position relative to the aircraft and transitioning to be at the subject's level. This movement makes the runway in the middle ground appear to rise toward the descending plane in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large, white commercial airplane viewed from behind, flying towards a runway. The aircraft's wings are extended horizontally, and its engines are visible under the wings. The plane is centered in the frame, with its tail fin prominently displayed. Below the aircraft, the runway is illuminated with lights that guide the plane's approach. To the left, there are structures resembling airport buildings, which are lit and appear small in comparison to the plane. The scene is set against a dark background, emphasizing the airplane and runway lights.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor nighttime scene featuring an airplane approaching a runway. The setting is an airport, with the aircraft centrally positioned, viewed from behind as it descends towards the illuminated landing strip. The runway is marked by bright lights that contrast with the surrounding darkness, highlighting its path. To the left of the runway, airport buildings are visible, characterized by their structured layout and subtle lighting. The airplane is white, with a sleek, aerodynamic shape, and its engines and tail are clearly defined against the night sky. The scene captures the motion of the aircraft as it nears the ground, emphasizing the structured environment of the airport at night.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that very closely follows the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-written. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Strengths:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately uses spatial terminology. It correctly identifies the shot size (\"full shot\"), the 2D positions (\"centered in the top half,\" \"center,\" \"left\"), the 3D depth (\"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\"), and the camera's height and position relative to the subject (\"below and behind,\" \"at the subject's level\").\n*   **Completeness:** It successfully describes all the required elements: the main subject (airplane), secondary elements (runway, buildings), their initial framing, and the dynamic changes. The description of the movement is particularly strong, detailing the descent of the plane, the following motion of the camera, and the resulting change in the relationship between the foreground and middle ground.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The caption is written in a single, coherent paragraph using simple, natural English. It avoids jargon and clearly communicates the visual information without unnecessary words.\n*   **Adherence to Negative Constraints:** It correctly avoids emotional adjectives and speculative statements for the most part. It describes what is visible without making assumptions.\n\n### Area for Improvement:\n\n*   **Minor Wording Violation:** The instruction states to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'it appears'\". The final sentence uses the phrase \"appear to rise\". While this is used to describe a visual effect (parallax), it technically violates the rule. A more direct, objective phrasing would be: \"This movement causes the runway in the middle ground to rise within the frame toward the descending plane in the foreground.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is of very high quality and almost perfectly adheres to all instructions. The only point of critique is a minor wording choice that could be slightly more objective to be in perfect alignment with the rules. Overall, it is a great example of the desired output.",
