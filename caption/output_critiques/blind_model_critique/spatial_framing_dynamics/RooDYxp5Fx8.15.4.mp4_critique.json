    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a city sidewalk bordered by a dark brown metal railing with vertical bars and a yellow tactile paving strip set into gray tiles. The camera moves forward along the sidewalk, revealing a street intersection with several vehicles, including white and red cars, moving in an orderly manner at a crosswalk marked by orange traffic cones. The background features lush green trees partially obscuring a building with a sloped roof, and a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds suggests daytime and fair weather. Street signs, utility poles, and a large metal-backed sign with visible bolts and a reflective surface are positioned near the sidewalk, and the overall environment is clean and orderly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban intersection bordered by lush green trees and a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The scene features a wide, clean sidewalk with a tactile paving strip, dark brown metal railings, and various street signs and traffic cones, while several vehicles, including white and red cars, are visible on the road. The focus is on the overall environment, highlighting the harmonious blend of urban infrastructure and natural elements, rather than emphasizing any single object or individual. There is no main subject because the intent is to convey the atmosphere and scale of the cityscape, immersing the viewer in the setting itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moving along a city sidewalk bordered by a dark brown metal railing with vertical bars and a yellow tactile paving strip set into gray tiles. The setting is outdoors at a street intersection, with several vehicles, including white and red cars, moving in an orderly manner at a crosswalk marked by orange traffic cones. Lush green trees line the background, partially obscuring a building with a sloped roof, while a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds suggests daytime and fair weather. Street signs, utility poles, and a large metal-backed sign with visible bolts and a reflective surface are positioned near the sidewalk, and the overall environment is clean and orderly.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for this video because it fails to adhere to the core instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Missing Core Spatial Information:** The primary instruction is to describe **spatial framing**, including shot size, 2D/3D position, depth, and camera height. The caption almost completely ignores this.\n    *   **Shot Size:** It does not specify the shot size (e.g., wide shot, first-person POV shot).\n    *   **Position:** It lists elements like the railing, sidewalk, and street signs but fails to describe their 2D position (e.g., left, right, center) or 3D position (e.g., foreground, middle ground). For example, it should have stated that the railing is in the foreground on the left side of the frame.\n    *   **Camera Height:** It does not mention the camera's height relative to the scene (e.g., eye-level).\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** While it correctly notes the camera moves forward, it doesn't describe the resulting spatial changes, such as how elements in the foreground move relative to the frame's edges.\n\n*   **Inclusion of Forbidden Elements:** The instructions explicitly forbid subjective adjectives and speculative statements, but the caption includes several.\n    *   **Subjective Adjectives:** It uses words like \"lush\" green trees, \"clean and orderly\" environment, and vehicles moving in an \"orderly manner.\" These are subjective interpretations of the scene.\n    *   **Speculative Statements:** It uses the phrase \"suggests daytime and fair weather,\" which is a speculative conclusion rather than a direct observation.\n\n*   **Focus on Content Over Framing:** The caption reads like a simple inventory of objects in the scene (railing, cars, trees, signs) rather than an analysis of how those objects are composed and framed spatially, which was the main goal of the instruction. It describes *what* is in the video, not *how* it is presented visually.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a wide shot of a city sidewalk, with the camera positioned at eye-level. In the foreground on the left side of the frame, a dark brown metal railing with vertical bars is visible, while a yellow tactile paving strip runs parallel along the gray tiles. As the camera moves forward, the spatial dynamics shift, revealing a street intersection in the middle ground. Vehicles, including white and red cars, are seen moving through a crosswalk marked by orange traffic cones. In the background, green trees partially obscure a building with a sloped roof. The sky is clear and blue with scattered white clouds, indicating daytime. Street signs and utility poles are positioned on the right side of the frame, and a large metal-backed sign with visible bolts and a reflective surface is near the sidewalk. The overall environment is depicted in a structured and organized manner.",
