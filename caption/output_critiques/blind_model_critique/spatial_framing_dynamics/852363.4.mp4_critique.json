    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot focusing on a man positioned in the center foreground of the frame. His head occupies the majority of the central area. In the background, several out-of-focus lights are visible, primarily scattered across the top left and top right portions of the frame. The man's head moves slightly within the frame, but his overall position and the shot size remain constant. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a light skin tone and short, dark hair. He is facing the camera with a wide, open-mouthed expression, suggesting he might be speaking or reacting to something. The lighting is dim, casting shadows on his face, and there are small, bright lights visible in the background, possibly indicating a nighttime setting. The man's facial features are partially obscured by the low light, but his expression remains the focal point throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set in a dark environment, likely at night or in a dimly lit indoor space. Several out-of-focus, circular lights are visible in the background against the overall darkness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as a close-up and accurately places the man in the center foreground. The description of the out-of-focus background lights scattered across the top left and top right is also precise. The observation of the man's slight head movement and the static camera position is correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully addresses all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** \"close-up shot\"\n*   **Position (2D/3D):** \"center foreground\" for the man, \"background,\" \"top left,\" and \"top right\" for the lights.\n*   **Dynamics:** \"moves slightly within the frame, but his overall position and the shot size remain constant.\"\n*   **Camera Height:** \"The camera is positioned at the subject's level.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption perfectly adheres to all stylistic and structural rules. It is a single, concise paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids subjective adjectives, speculation, and ambiguity. It focuses entirely on the spatial framing and dynamics as requested, providing a clear and objective description of the scene.\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, complete, and perfectly formatted.",
