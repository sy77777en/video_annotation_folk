    "pre_caption": "This abstract scene is captured from a straight-on perspective. A landscape of undulating golden particles occupies the bottom of the frame, serving as the foreground and middle ground. Positioned in the horizontal center, a bright light source glows at the horizon line where the particle landscape meets the dark background. From this central area in the middle ground, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rise upwards, extending into the upper half of the frame. Additional golden particles are scattered throughout the entire scene, from foreground to background, with some rising and others drifting downwards.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This abstract animation features a deep-gold scene filled with shimmering golden elements. The bottom of the scene is a dynamic, wavy surface composed of countless tiny, glowing golden particles, resembling a glittering, undulating landscape. From this surface, numerous points of light emerge, with some leaving delicate trails of vertical golden lines, while others form small paths resembling golden frost. Additional golden particles of various sizes, some appearing as sharp specks and others as soft, out-of-focus orbs, drift and float throughout the space, with some gently falling downwards. Some elements flicker and gradually fade away, adding a dynamic and mesmerizing effect to the scene. A bright, horizontal light source glows intensely at the horizon line, where the wavy particle field meets the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an abstract, dark environment, a landscape of shimmering golden particles undulates in gentle waves at the bottom of the scene. From a bright, central point on the horizon, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rise upwards, accompanied by smaller, floating specks of light. These luminous particles drift throughout the space, creating a dynamic effect of rising and falling golden light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key visual elements: the \"undulating golden particles\" forming a landscape, the central \"bright light source\" at the horizon, the \"thin, vertical lines of golden light\" rising upwards, and the \"additional golden particles\" scattered throughout. The description of their movement (\"undulating,\" \"rise upwards,\" \"rising and others drifting downwards\") is also a precise representation of the dynamics in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very thorough and successfully covers almost all the required aspects of the instructions:\n*   **2D Position:** It effectively uses terms like \"bottom of the frame,\" \"horizontal center,\" and \"upper half\" to place elements within the 2D space.\n*   **3D Depth:** It correctly assigns elements to the \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" and \"background,\" creating a clear sense of depth.\n*   **Camera Height:** It correctly identifies the \"straight-on perspective.\"\n*   **Movement:** It clearly describes the spatial dynamics, such as the particles undulating and rising, and the lines extending upwards.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to the core instructions.\n*   It is a concise, single paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   It focuses strictly on spatial framing and dynamics, avoiding emotional or subjective language (\"golden\" and \"bright\" are used as objective descriptors of color and luminosity).\n*   It avoids speculation and ambiguity.\n\n**Area for Improvement:**\nThe only minor point of deviation from the instructions is the omission of the initial **shot size** declaration. The instructions state, \"First, specify the shot size... If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\" While the description implies a wide view, explicitly starting with \"This is a wide shot of an abstract scene...\" would make it perfectly aligned with the guidelines.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is accurate, detailed, and follows nearly all instructions precisely. Its description of the spatial composition and movement is clear and effective. The only improvement would be to explicitly state the shot size at the beginning of the sentence.",
