    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the camera is positioned at approximately head height within a dense crowd, looking forward toward a stage. The silhouettes of people occupy the entire foreground and middle ground, filling the bottom and central portions of the frame. Their raised arms frequently extend into the upper half of the frame, partially obscuring the background. In the background and at the top of the frame, stage lights and a disco ball are positioned. Beams of light, alternating between red, blue, and purple, project from the background and ceiling, cutting through the hazy middle ground and illuminating the scene. The crowd members in the foreground and middle ground jump and move, causing their silhouettes and raised hands to shift dynamically within the frame, while the handheld camera experiences slight, natural movements consistent with being in a crowd.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective within a dense crowd, numerous people are visible as dark silhouettes against vibrant, shifting stage lights. The individuals, seen from the back, are packed closely together, facing away from the viewer. Many have their arms raised high in the air, some with open palms and others with pointed fingers, as they jump and dance. The entire scene is bathed in intense, alternating washes of red, blue, and purple light, which cast long beams through a hazy atmosphere and obscure most of the concertgoers' specific features and clothing. Occasionally, the small, glowing rectangular screens of smartphones held aloft by some members of the crowd can be seen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A handheld phone captures a dynamic scene from within a crowded, dark nightclub, giving the impression of a first-person perspective. The air is thick with haze, illuminated by strobing and shifting stage lights that bathe the room in alternating washes of intense red, deep blue, and vibrant purple. Beams of light cut through the darkness from the ceiling, where a disco ball is occasionally visible. In the foreground and middle ground, the silhouettes of a dense crowd of people are seen from behind, many with their hands raised in the air, dancing.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a first-person perspective of a person at a concert. The crowd in front of the viewer jumps up and down, with their arms raised in the air, partially blocking the stage view as the lighting shifts between blue and red.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively establishes the first-person perspective and the layered depth of the scene, but it could be more specific to better capture the dynamic environment. The shot size is not explicitly stated and should be identified at the beginning, likely as a wide shot. The description of camera movement as having \"slight, natural movements\" seems understated for a jumping crowd; a more accurate description might be \"energetic and bouncy, synchronized with the crowd's movement.\" While the stage is mentioned in the background, the caption omits any visible elements on it, such as the small, silhouetted figures of performers or a large video screen that are likely present. Furthermore, the caption identifies the disco ball but fails to describe its visual effect, such as the myriad of small, moving light specks it casts across the crowd and through the haze. Finally, the description of the crowd's motion is generic; specifying if they are swaying in unison, fist-pumping, or bouncing to a rhythm would provide a more vivid and precise account of the scene's dynamics.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a wide shot from a first-person perspective, capturing the vibrant energy of a dense crowd. The camera, positioned at head height, looks forward toward a stage, where small, silhouetted figures of performers and a large video screen are visible. The foreground and middle ground are filled with the silhouettes of people, their raised arms frequently extending into the upper half of the frame, partially obscuring the background. Stage lights and a disco ball are positioned at the top of the frame, casting beams of red, blue, and purple light that cut through the hazy middle ground, illuminating the scene. The disco ball creates a mesmerizing effect, scattering myriad small, moving light specks across the crowd and through the haze. The crowd members in the foreground and middle ground are energetically bouncing and fist-pumping in unison to the rhythm, causing their silhouettes and raised hands to shift dynamically within the frame. The handheld camera moves with an energetic and bouncy rhythm, synchronized with the crowd's movement, enhancing the immersive experience of being in the midst of the lively scene.",
