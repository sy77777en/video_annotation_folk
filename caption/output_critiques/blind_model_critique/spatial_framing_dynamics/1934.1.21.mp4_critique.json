    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a woman, capturing her from the chest up. She is positioned slightly off-center to the left in the frame, with her body oriented towards a large, white object situated on the right side. This object, featuring a black panel with buttons, is in the foreground, partially obscuring the view of the woman when she moves closer to it. The woman's movements are subtle, involving slight shifts in her stance and head orientation as she interacts with the object. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's eye level, ensuring the focus remains on her actions and the object. The background consists of plain white walls, contributing to the minimalist setting. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with light skin and short, dark hair, wearing a white outfit with orange stripes. She has a white hood covering her head and goggles resting on top. She looks towards a large, white object with a black panel and buttons.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors, featuring a minimalist environment with white walls and a sleek, modern design. The setting includes a person wearing a white outfit with orange stripes, complemented by a headpiece and goggles, suggesting a futuristic or scientific theme. The lighting is bright and even, indicating a well-lit space, possibly a laboratory or a high-tech facility. The midground includes a large, white, rectangular structure with a control panel, adding to the technological ambiance. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining a clean and uncluttered appearance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**. It successfully meets all the requirements for describing the spatial framing and dynamics of the video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the visual information. It correctly identifies the shot size (\"close-up... from the chest up\"), the subjects (a woman and a white object), their positions (woman left of center, object on the right in the foreground), their interaction, the camera's height (\"eye level\"), and the static nature of the shot.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive and covers all the key aspects requested in the instructions:\n    *   **Shot Size:** Clearly stated as a \"close-up shot... from the chest up.\"\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It effectively details the 2D positions (woman \"slightly off-center to the left,\" object \"on the right side\") and 3D depth (object in the \"foreground,\" with the woman behind it and walls in the \"background\").\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** It describes the woman's \"subtle shifts\" and how the foreground object \"partially obscur[es]\" her, which perfectly captures the dynamic spatial relationship. It also notes the camera is \"steady.\"\n    *   **Camera Height:** Explicitly mentioned as \"at the subject's eye level.\"\n    *   **Changes:** It correctly states that there are \"no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning.\"\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the stylistic and content rules perfectly.\n    *   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n    *   It uses simple, natural English.\n    *   It remains objective and avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., no \"it seems,\" \"perhaps,\" \"beautifully framed\").\n    *   It focuses strictly on spatial framing and movement, avoiding any narrative interpretation.",
