    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, a person stands in the foreground on the right side of the frame, positioned on a wooden deck next to a brightly lit doorway. In the middle ground, a single-story house is visible in the center-left. The background is filled with a green aurora that occupies the upper half of the sky, partially obscured by dark clouds. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera‚Äôs height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it‚Äôs not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don‚Äôt write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a light blue hooded jacket and dark pants stands on a wooden deck at night, with their back to the camera. They are near the door of a building, which is illuminated by a bright light. The person is looking up at the sky, where a green aurora is visible, after having turned their head from looking to the left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, a vibrant green aurora borealis illuminates the dark sky above a rural landscape. Dark clouds are scattered across the sky, partially obscuring the light show. In the middle ground, a person wearing a turquoise hooded jacket stands on a wooden deck attached to a structure with a bright exterior light. A modern, single-story house with lit windows is also situated in the middle ground, while a house with dark windows is visible in the background. An overlay at the top of the screen displays white text that reads, \"Sadly clouds had formed and they were blocking the show üò©\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It perfectly adheres to all instructions and provides a clear, accurate, and comprehensive description of the video's spatial composition.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as a \"wide shot\" and notes that it is \"static.\" The spatial placement of all key elements is precise: the person in the \"foreground on the right,\" the house in the \"middle ground... center-left,\" and the aurora and clouds in the \"background\" occupying the \"upper half.\" The camera height is also correctly identified as being at the \"subject's level.\"\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is thorough. It successfully breaks down the scene into three distinct depths (foreground, middle ground, background) and populates each with the relevant subjects and elements. It covers all the required components: shot size, 2D position, 3D depth, camera height, and movement (in this case, the lack of it).\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions perfectly.\n    *   It begins with the shot size (\"wide shot\").\n    *   It uses simple, objective language (\"stands,\" \"visible,\" \"occupies\") and avoids emotional or speculative words.\n    *   It is structured as a single, coherent paragraph that flows logically from the foreground to the background.\n    *   It successfully achieves the main goal of describing the spatial framing and dynamics of the scene.",
