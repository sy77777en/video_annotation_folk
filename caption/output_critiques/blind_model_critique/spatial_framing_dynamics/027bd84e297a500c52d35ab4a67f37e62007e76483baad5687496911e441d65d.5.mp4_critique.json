    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a cylindrical nesting doll, predominantly white with blue and green floral patterns, positioned in the foreground on the left side of the frame. As the video progresses, the nesting doll rolls from the left towards the right, moving out of the frame. This transition shifts the shot size to a wide view, revealing a smaller blue nesting doll in the foreground on the left side. The smaller nesting doll then rolls slowly across the frame from left to right, maintaining its position in the foreground. The background remains a plain white throughout, providing a consistent backdrop. The camera maintains a level position relative to the subjects, capturing their movements smoothly as they roll across the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins a cylindrical nesting doll, predominantly white with blue and green floral patterns.  Initially, the blue nesting doll is lying down and rolls out of the frame, revealing another nesting doll behind it that is also lying down and rolling on the surface. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a minimalistic indoor setting with a plain white background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",

  "generated_critique": "The critique of the caption is that its description of movement and spatial depth could be more precise. The phrase \"rolls forward to the left\" for the first doll is ambiguous; a clearer description would be \"rolls diagonally toward the bottom-left of the frame,\" specifying its path relative to the camera and the frame edge. The caption states the transition \"shifts to a wide shot,\" which is vague; it should specify if this is a hard cut, a zoom out, or another type of transition. For the second doll, the description that it \"rolls to the left, positioned in the middle ground\" is confusing because it doesn't explain how it moves from its initial foreground position at the bottom center into the middle ground; it should explicitly state that the doll rolls diagonally away from the camera and to the left. Additionally, describing the first nesting doll as \"cylindrical\" seems potentially inaccurate, as they are typically ovoid or bell-shaped; if it has curves, a more fitting term should be used. Finally, the initial depth of the first doll is not mentioned; it should be established as being in the foreground at the beginning of the shot to provide a complete spatial context from the start.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium shot of an ovoid nesting doll, predominantly white with blue and green floral patterns, positioned in the foreground on the left side of the frame. Initially, the doll is in the foreground, and as the video progresses, it rolls diagonally toward the bottom-left of the frame, eventually moving out of view. This action transitions to a wide shot through a smooth zoom out, revealing a smaller blue nesting doll in the foreground on the left side. The smaller nesting doll then rolls diagonally away from the camera and to the right, maintaining its position in the foreground. The background remains a plain white throughout, providing a consistent backdrop. The camera maintains a level position relative to the subjects, capturing their movements smoothly as they roll across the scene.",
