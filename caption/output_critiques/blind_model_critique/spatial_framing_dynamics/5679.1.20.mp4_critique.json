    "pre_caption": "In a static, overhead medium-close-up shot, a man is centered in the frame, lying in the middle ground on a lawn. A portion of a dog occupies the middle ground on the left side of the frame. The green grass fills the background, with a single brown leaf visible in the middle ground in the bottom right corner. The camera remains positioned directly above the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a medium-brown skin tone, long dark dreadlocks, and a trimmed beard and mustache lies on his back with his hands behind his head, looking directly up at the camera. He wears a bright blue zip-up jacket with a white logo on the chest and a fuzzy, lime-green and light-blue bucket hat. To his left, a portion of a large dog with thick, curly, light-beige fur is visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an overhead perspective, a person with dreadlocks lies on a patch of vibrant green grass with their hands behind their head. They are wearing a bright blue zip-up jacket and a textured, lime-green bucket hat. A few dry, brown leaves are scattered on the lawn. To the left side of the scene, a portion of a fluffy, beige surface is visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The caption correctly identifies the main subjects and the camera's overhead position and zoom-out. However, it contains speculative language (\"likely a dog\"), which should be avoided; the video clearly shows a beige poodle resting its head on the man's chest. The description of the initial shot is too general; the video begins with a tight close-up on the dog's head before the camera pulls back, not a close-up of the man. The term \"background\" is used incorrectly for a top-down shot; the grass is the ground plane on which the subjects are lying, not a separate background element. A more accurate description would place the man and dog in the center of this plane. The caption also misses the subtle but important dynamic of the man gently stroking the dog's back with his right hand, a key interaction that defines their spatial relationship. Lastly, the leaf is not just in the corner; it's in the immediate foreground and slightly out of focus, creating a sense of depth that the current description omits.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a tight close-up of a beige poodle resting its head on a man's chest. As the camera pulls back to a static, overhead medium-close-up shot, the man and the dog are centered on the grass plane. The man gently strokes the dog's back with his right hand, highlighting their close interaction. The green grass serves as the ground plane, with a single brown leaf slightly out of focus in the immediate foreground, adding depth to the scene.",
