    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle wide shot of a desert, with a small shelter, a person, and two camels positioned in the middle ground, slightly right of center. In the background, a blue car is visible in the top left, moving across the dunes. The camera rapidly moves forward and down, passing over the person and camels, which briefly occupy the foreground before blurring out of focus. The camera then follows the blue car as it drifts across the middle ground, kicking up a large plume of sand. The shot transitions to a low-angle, extreme close-up, where the frame is completely filled with sand and small pieces of debris flying directly toward the camera in slow motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person, two camels, and a car. The person, dressed in dark blue or black clothing that covers their body and head, is sitting on the sand. Next to them, one light-brown camel stands with a dark pack on its back, while a second camel lies on the ground. A blue car speeds across the sand dunes, kicking up a large cloud of dust. The focus then shifts to a close-up, slow-motion view of the sand and small, dark pieces of debris being thrown into the air, flying directly toward the viewer.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a vast desert landscape characterized by rolling, golden-brown sand dunes under a hazy sky. A small, rudimentary wooden shelter stands in the sand, with two camels and a person positioned beside it. The drone's perspective shifts to dynamically follow a blue car as it speeds and drifts across the dunes, kicking up large plumes of sand. The sequence transitions to a close-up view of sand and small pebbles being propelled through the air toward the camera.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video takes place in a desert surrounding. In the beginning, the camera moves closer to two camels and a person, then quickly passes over them, revealing a car speeding through the desert, kicking up a large amount of sand. The camera then approaches the flying sand, transitioning into a slow-motion shot of sand and debris flying toward the camera, creating a powerful scene.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It masterfully adheres to all instructions, resulting in a clear, accurate, and comprehensive description of the video's spatial framing and dynamics.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption uses technical cinematography terms (high-angle, wide shot, low-angle, extreme close-up) correctly. The description of movement is precise and logical, detailing the camera's path (\"moves forward and down,\" \"follows the blue car\") and the subjects' actions (\"moving across the dunes,\" \"flying directly toward the camera\").\n\n*   **Completeness:** It successfully covers all the required elements for both distinct parts of the video.\n    *   **Shot 1:** It establishes the initial **shot size** (wide shot), **camera height** (high-angle), and the **2D/3D positions** of multiple elements (shelter, person, camels in the middle ground, right of center; car in the background, top left).\n    *   **Dynamics:** It perfectly captures the spatial changes, describing the camera's rapid forward and downward movement and how this shifts the subjects from the middle ground to the foreground before they exit the frame.\n    *   **Shot 2:** It clearly notes the shot transition and describes the new framing in detail: a **low-angle, extreme close-up** where the frame is filled with sand moving toward the camera.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is packed with spatial information without any wasted words.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"cool,\" \"dramatic\") and speculative phrases (\"it appears,\" \"might be\"), sticking to observable facts.\n    *   **Focus on Spatial Framing:** The entire description is centered on the core instruction: describing the spatial relationships, positions, and movements of subjects and the camera.\n    *   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English, exactly as requested.",
