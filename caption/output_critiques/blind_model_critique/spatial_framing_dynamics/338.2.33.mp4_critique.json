    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a man seated at a table in a restaurant. The man occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground. He is seated directly facing the camera, which is at his eye level. Behind him, in the middle ground, two large, ornate circular archways with intricate designs dominate the background. These archways are symmetrically placed, one on the left and one on the right side of the frame. Within these archways, blurred figures of people can be seen moving around, indicating a busy restaurant environment. The table in front of the man, also in the foreground, holds a neatly folded napkin. Throughout the video, the man remains stationary while the background figures continue to move subtly, creating a dynamic contrast between the stillness of the subject and the activity behind him. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man seated at a table in a restaurant. He has a medium-dark skin tone and is wearing a light yellow polo shirt. His hair is short and dark. The man is facing forward with a calm expression. The table in front of him is set with a folded napkin. In the background, there are other people, slightly blurred, moving around, suggesting a busy restaurant environment. The setting includes ornate decor with a circular design behind the man, adding a decorative element to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting within a warmly lit restaurant, characterized by intricate, circular wooden archways with ornate carvings. The environment is bustling, with blurred figures in the background suggesting movement and activity. The lighting is soft and ambient, casting a cozy glow over the scene. A table is prominently featured in the foreground, set with a neatly folded napkin and simple tableware. The overall atmosphere is inviting, with rich, warm colors and detailed decor contributing to a sense of elegance and cultural richness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that very effectively adheres to the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-written.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately identifies the main subject (a man), his posture (seated at a table, facing the camera), and the key elements of the setting (table, napkin, archways, background figures).\n*   It correctly describes the spatial relationships, such as the man being in the center foreground and the archways being behind him.\n*   The description of movement (static subject, moving background figures) is precise and captures the core dynamic of the scene.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Shot Size:** The caption correctly starts by identifying the \"medium shot.\"\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It successfully describes the position of multiple elements. For example, the man is \"center\" (2D) and \"foreground\" (3D), and the archways are on the \"left and right\" (2D) and in the \"middle ground\" (3D).\n*   **Camera Height:** It explicitly states the camera is at the man's \"eye level.\"\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** The caption clearly explains that the foreground subject is stationary while the background contains movement, fulfilling the requirement to describe dynamics and changes (or lack thereof).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph provides a rich, detailed description of the scene's composition without unnecessary words.\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear, easy to follow, and avoids jargon.\n*   **Avoids Prohibited Content:**\n    *   It avoids emotional or overly subjective adjectives. While \"ornate\" and \"intricate\" are descriptive, they describe the physical complexity of the archways rather than an emotional response, which is acceptable.\n    *   It avoids speculation. The phrase \"indicating a busy restaurant environment\" is a logical inference based on visual cues (moving people in what appears to be a restaurant) and stays well within reasonable interpretation without using speculative language like \"might be\" or \"it seems.\"\n*   **Structure:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph that flows logically from the main subject to the background elements and finally to the overall dynamics, as instructed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a medium shot of a man seated at a table in a restaurant, centrally positioned in the foreground and facing the camera at eye level. Behind him, two large, ornate circular archways with intricate designs are symmetrically placed on the left and right, dominating the middle ground. Blurred figures move within these archways, suggesting a bustling restaurant atmosphere. The table in front of the man holds a neatly folded napkin. Throughout the video, the man remains still while the background figures subtly move, creating a dynamic contrast between the stationary subject and the active environment. The shot size and spatial positioning remain consistent throughout the sequence.",
