    "pre_caption": "A man in a wingsuit is captured in a full shot, occupying the center-foreground of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, angled downwards from a first-person perspective. Below him, a steep, rocky mountain face fills the bottom half of the frame in the middle ground, while an overcast sky is visible in the top background. The man remains relatively static in his central position as the rocky terrain rushes upward toward the camera, creating a dynamic sense of rapid forward and downward movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with a light-colored goatee is shown in mid-air from a helmet-mounted camera perspective. He is wearing a white helmet with an orange \"numa\" logo, black windproof goggles, and a black and yellow wingsuit with white panels on the underside of the wings. Blue straps are fastened across his chest, and black and white patterned straps for his equipment are visible, positioned vertically from his shoulders. His mouth is open, and his face shows an expression of intense concentration.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot mounted on a helmet, the perspective looks down past a person in a wingsuit as they fly extremely close to a steep, grey rock face. The rugged mountain terrain, composed of layered, craggy rock, rushes upward toward the camera under a flat, overcast white sky. The person is wearing a white helmet, dark sunglasses, and a black and yellow wingsuit with a blue harness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subject and the general composition, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics. The term \"full shot\" might be an overstatement; if the camera is following closely, it is more likely a medium-long shot where the wingsuit-clad figure dominates the frame. The description of the man as \"relatively static\" overlooks the key movement of the turn itself; for instance, as he executes the \"soaring turn,\" he likely banks his body sharply to one side, altering his orientation and momentarily shifting from the center to the right or left of the frame. Furthermore, stating the camera angle \"shifts\" is an interpretation of cause and effect. A more direct visual description would be that as the man pulls up, the mountain face moves down and out of the bottom of the frame, causing the background sky to occupy a larger portion of the view. Finally, while the description of the terrain rushing upward is effective, the caption could more clearly separate the visual motion (terrain scrolling up) from the inferred motion (the man's forward and downward flight).",
