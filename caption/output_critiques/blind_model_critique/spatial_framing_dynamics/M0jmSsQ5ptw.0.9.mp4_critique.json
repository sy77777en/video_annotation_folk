    "pre_caption": "From a stationary, wide-angle, first-person perspective, the scene is viewed through a wooden structure that creates a frame-within-a-frame, with dark vertical supports on the left and right. In the center foreground, a chainsaw chain moves vertically downwards, cutting through a horizontal wooden beam that extends across the middle ground. As the chain cuts, the beam splinters and separates in the center of the frame. Through the structure, a paved lot and a white ramp are visible in the middle ground, with industrial buildings and a hill range in the background under a cloudy sky. A black object is fixed in the bottom foreground of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person, wide-angle perspective, a chainsaw's moving, toothed chain is visible as it cuts vertically through a horizontal, light-colored wooden beam. The beam is part of a larger wooden frame held together by dark vertical supports. As the cut progresses, the wood splinters and breaks apart, creating a jagged separation and sending sawdust flying through the air.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot captures a chainsaw blade cutting through a horizontal wooden plank, which is part of a larger wooden frame held by black vertical supports. The scene is set outdoors during the day in a paved industrial lot with yellow lines on the asphalt. In the distance, a long white ramp extends towards industrial-style buildings and a blue fence. A hill range is visible under a partly cloudy sky. As the chainsaw cuts, wood splinters and dust fly through the air.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively establishes the scene's depth with foreground, middle ground, and background elements, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and framing. The description of a \"moving, first-person perspective\" is ambiguous; it would be clearer to state if the camera is fixed while the saw moves within the frame, or if the entire camera setup is, for example, tilting downwards to follow the action. The caption also misses specifying the initial shot size, which appears to be a medium shot focused on the cutting mechanism, and omits the crucial detail that the camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down onto the beam. The description of the action could be more detailed; instead of just the \"chain\" moving, it's the entire saw bar assembly that descends. Furthermore, the caption fails to describe the spatial result of the cut—it mentions the beam separates, but it should also note how the two severed halves move, for instance, by falling slightly downwards and outwards from the center. Finally, the \"black object\" is too vague; describing it as the upper edge of the machine's housing would provide more contextual information without being speculative.",
