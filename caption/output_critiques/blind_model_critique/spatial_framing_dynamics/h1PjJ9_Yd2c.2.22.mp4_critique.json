    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman is seen from behind, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground of a narrow hallway. The camera, positioned at her level, follows her as she walks away, moving from the middle ground toward the background. Throughout this movement, she remains centered in the frame, flanked by the hallway's walls and doors on the left and right. A bright light at the far end of the corridor creates a strong backlight, which casts her figure in silhouette.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, dark hair tied back in a ponytail is seen from behind. She is wearing a grey, short-sleeved t-shirt. The scene is dimly lit, and for much of the video, she is silhouetted as she walks down a narrow hallway.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A woman with long hair, seen from behind, walks down a narrow and dimly lit indoor hallway. The corridor features plain, light-colored walls and several closed doors. A bright light source at the far end of the hall creates a stark backlight, rendering her figure as a dark silhouette. The camera follows her as she moves away, down the length of the corridor.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subject and her basic action but lacks precision in describing the spatial dynamics and framing. It omits the initial shot size, which is a medium long shot, capturing the woman from head to toe. The description of camera movement as \"moves forward and pans left\" is slightly misleading; the camera primarily tracks forward from an eye-level perspective, and the subtle left pan serves only to keep the woman centered as the hallway itself curves gently to the left. The caption also fails to mention key spatial elements, such as the textured brick walls and a series of closed wooden doors on the right side of the hallway, which exist in the middle ground and add depth to the scene. While the woman is in the foreground relative to the camera, stating she \"consistently remains in the foreground\" is an oversimplification; she is actively moving deeper into the scene's space, progressing from the near middle ground toward the background. Finally, the description of the ending is incomplete; as she opens the door, the camera's forward movement stops, and she is completely consumed by the bright light before stepping through the doorway and disappearing from the frame.",
