    "pre_caption": "A small, four-lobed black outline appears in the center of the frame against a white background. This central shape rapidly expands and multiplies outwards, with new forms sprouting in all directions to fill the screen. The animation concludes with a static, dense, and intricate pattern of interconnected, hand-drawn organic shapes covering the entire frame. The scene is captured from a fixed, top-down perspective, presenting the growth as a two-dimensional event.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A hand-drawn, black-and-white animation depicts the rapid growth of an abstract, plant-like organism. Initially, a small, four-lobed shape with rounded corners appears in the center of a white expanse. This shape quickly expands and multiplies, sprouting into an intricate and dense pattern of organic forms. The final composition features twisting, vine-like lines, stylized leaves, small, round, fruit-like spheres, and scattered star-shaped figures, all rendered in a sketchy, black-ink style.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A small, four-lobed black outline on a white background rapidly expands and multiplies, transforming into a dense, intricate pattern of hand-drawn, organic forms. The resulting black-and-white composition features swirling, vine-like lines, leafy structures, star-shaped figures, and several spherical shapes, all interconnected in an abstract arrangement that fills the space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the general transformation from a single shape to a full-screen pattern, it lacks specificity in its spatial description. It fails to define the initial shot size, which could be described as a medium shot of the white canvas. The description remains entirely two-dimensional, missing the opportunity to detail the illusion of depth created by the overlapping shapes; it should clarify whether new forms emerge in the foreground or background relative to existing ones. The dynamic term 'sprouting' is effective but could be more precise by explaining if the lines themselves extend and branch out or if new, separate shapes simply appear and connect. Furthermore, the initial appearance is vaguely described as the shape 'appears,' whereas specifying if it pops, fades, or is drawn on-screen would be more informative. Finally, the term 'interconnected' for the final pattern is ambiguous; clarifying if the shapes form a single, continuous line network or are merely adjacent and overlapping would provide a more complete picture of the final static composition.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium shot of a white canvas, where a small, four-lobed black outline pops into view at the center. This shape rapidly expands and multiplies outwards, with new forms sprouting in all directions. The lines themselves extend and branch out, creating an intricate network. As the animation progresses, the overlapping shapes create an illusion of depth, with some forms emerging in the foreground while others recede into the background. The animation concludes with a static, dense pattern of interconnected shapes, forming a continuous line network that covers the entire frame. The scene is captured from a fixed, top-down perspective, presenting the growth as a dynamic, two-dimensional event with a sense of depth.",
