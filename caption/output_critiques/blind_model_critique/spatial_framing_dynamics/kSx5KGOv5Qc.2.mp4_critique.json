    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures a scenic landscape from a high-angle perspective. In the foreground, a rocky, green hillside spans the bottom of the frame. The historic walled city on a peninsula occupies the center of the middle ground, with a small harbor on its left. A white cable car structure is positioned on the right, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. The sea surrounds the city and fills the top portion of the frame, serving as the background, where a small, green island is located in the top left. A text overlay is visible in the top left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a panoramic cityscape and seascape scenery shot, offering a high-angle, sweeping view of a historic coastal city. The city, distinguished by its dense collection of terracotta-roofed buildings, is entirely enclosed by formidable stone walls and situated on a peninsula that extends into the deep blue sea, with a small, verdant island visible in the background. The shot is taken from a rocky, green hillside in the foreground, which includes part of a cable car structure, enhancing the sense of elevation. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to capture the grand scale and picturesque atmosphere of the location, focusing on the relationship between the ancient architecture and its stunning natural surroundings rather than any single element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high vantage point on a rocky, green hillside, the scene captures a historic walled city situated on a peninsula jutting into a deep blue sea. The city is a dense cluster of buildings with distinctive orange-red terracotta roofs, entirely encircled by thick, light-gray stone fortifications. A small harbor with docked boats is nestled along the city walls. In the distance, a small, verdant island is visible on the water. To the right, a white tower stands, which could be either a utility tower or a cable car support tower, with a red section painted on it. The warm light suggests either early morning or late afternoon. An overlay in the top-left corner contains the text \"Xscion.org\" and \"COPYRIGHT\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the extreme wide shot and the high-angle perspective, but it misrepresents the spatial relationships in the foreground and completely omits the video's dynamic movement. It describes the \"rocky, green hillside\" and the \"white and grey rocks\" as separate entities at the bottom of the frame, when in the video, the white and grey rocks are clearly part of the larger green hillside that constitutes the entire foreground. More importantly, the caption treats the scene as a static photograph, failing to mention the slow, continuous drone movement pushing forward and slightly upward. This movement causes the foreground hillside to gradually expand and occupy more of the bottom frame, while the walled city in the middle ground appears to grow larger and closer. The caption also misses the dynamic elements in the background, such as two small white boats moving across the sea from left to right, passing behind the peninsula. Finally, the placement of the cable car structure is described confusingly as \"behind some white and grey rocks\"; a clearer description would be that it is situated on the right side of the foreground hillside.",

In the foreground, a rocky, green hillside spans the bottom of the frame, with white and grey rocks integrated into the hillside.
