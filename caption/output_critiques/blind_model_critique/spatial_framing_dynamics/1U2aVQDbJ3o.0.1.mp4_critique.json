    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of the Liwa Desert, capturing the vast expanse of undulating sand dunes. The camera is positioned above the scene, providing a bird's-eye view. The winding road cuts through the center of the frame, extending from the top left towards the bottom right. Initially, the road is empty, but as the video progresses, an off-road vehicle enters the frame from the top right, moving towards the bottom left. The vehicle is small in scale compared to the expansive desert, positioned in the middle ground. It creates a trail of dust behind it, which is visible in the foreground as it moves. The text \"LIWA Desert, United Arab Emirates\" is centrally placed in the upper middle part of the frame throughout the video. The camera remains stationary, maintaining a consistent perspective as the vehicle travels along the road. The overall spatial composition emphasizes the contrast between the small vehicle and the immense desert landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a vast desert landscape with undulating sand dunes in shades of golden brown. A prominent feature is a winding road cutting through the dunes. An off-road vehicle is seen traveling along this road, creating a trail of dust as it moves. The car appears small in comparison to the expansive desert.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV shot, showcases the vast expanse of the Liwa Desert in the United Arab Emirates. The setting is outdoors, featuring sweeping views of undulating sand dunes with a winding road cutting through the landscape. The time of day is likely midday, as the sunlight casts distinct shadows on the dunes, highlighting their curves and textures. The sand is a warm, golden-brown color, with smooth surfaces and occasional ridges. A vehicle is seen traveling along the road, leaving a trail of dust behind, emphasizing motion within the otherwise still desert environment. Initially, overlay text displays \"LIWA Desert, United Arab Emirates,\" centrally placed over the scene, which quickly transitions to other white text before eventually disappearing.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the overall camera movement and the primary subject, but it lacks the specific spatial details requested in the instructions. While it mentions the vehicle is small, it doesn't define the shot as an extreme wide shot. The description of the road and vehicle's position is too general; it could specify that the road enters from the bottom right of the frame, snakes through the middle ground, and exits toward the top left, with the vehicle traveling along this path. The caption also fails to use the required \"foreground, middle ground, background\" terminology to structure the scene, which would clarify the spatial relationship between the dunes closest to the camera, the road, and the dunes on the horizon. The description of the overlay text as changing to \"other text\" is vague; it would be more precise to describe the position and nature of the subsequent text or simply state that the initial text is replaced. Finally, the last sentence, \"The dynamic camera movement emphasizes the contrast...\", is a subjective interpretation of the shot's effect, which the instructions explicitly forbid. The description should focus purely on the objective spatial mechanics.",
