    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a group of people seated around a dining table in a restaurant. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, capturing them from the waist up. The central figure, a man with short dark hair in a light-colored shirt, is located in the middle of the frame, slightly towards the left, and is in the foreground. He holds a blue napkin and chopsticks in his left hand. To his right, another man with short hair and glasses, wearing a dark shirt, is also in the foreground, positioned near the center-right. Across the table, a woman with long dark hair in a green top is seen from behind, situated in the middle ground on the left side of the frame. A man in a yellow shirt and glasses, holding chopsticks, is in the foreground on the right. In the background, three men in maroon shirts are walking through the scene, carrying trays with food; they are positioned towards the top-center of the frame. The ornate wooden panels and warm lighting dominate the background, creating depth. The camera remains static throughout, maintaining consistent shot size and subject positions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of people seated around a dining table in a restaurant setting. At the center, a man with short dark hair, wearing a light-colored shirt, is holding a blue napkin and chopsticks in his left hand. To his right, a man with short hair and glasses, dressed in a dark shirt, is engaged in conversation. Across from them, a woman with long dark hair, wearing a green top, is seen from behind. Another man, wearing a yellow shirt and glasses, is holding chopsticks. In the background, three men in maroon shirts are walking while carrying trays with food. The setting is characterized by ornate wooden panels and warm lighting, creating a lively dining atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting within a traditional Asian restaurant. The environment features ornate wooden paneling with intricate carvings and warm lighting that creates a cozy atmosphere. The ceiling is adorned with decorative elements, enhancing the cultural ambiance. Tables are set with dishes and drinks, indicating a dining scene. Patrons are seated around tables, engaged in conversation and enjoying their meals. The presence of servers moving between tables adds a dynamic element to the scene. The overall color palette is warm, with rich browns and golds dominating the decor, complemented by the colorful attire of the diners.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and adheres very well to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate in its spatial description. It correctly identifies the shot size as a medium shot, the camera height as being at the subjects' level, and precisely maps out the 2D and 3D positions of multiple subjects (center-left foreground, center-right foreground, left middle ground, etc.). The description of movement (background figures walking) and non-movement (static camera) is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete. It addresses all the required components from the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** Clearly stated as \"medium shot.\"\n*   **Position (2D & 3D):** Provides both for every major subject and background elements.\n*   **Depth:** Effectively uses \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" and \"background\" to create a clear sense of the scene's depth.\n*   **Camera Height:** Correctly identified as \"at the subjects' level.\"\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** It explicitly notes that the camera is static while also describing the movement of the men in the background, perfectly capturing the scene's dynamics.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions almost perfectly.\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It uses simple, natural English.\n*   It avoids speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\") and emotional adjectives. The use of \"ornate\" and \"warm\" are descriptive rather than emotional and are acceptable for conveying the visual information.\n*   It successfully breaks down a complex scene with multiple subjects, identifying a central figure and describing others in relation to the frame and each other.\n*   The structure is logical, starting with the overall shot and then detailing the subjects and their positions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a high-quality caption that serves as a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is concise yet packed with all the necessary spatial information, painting a clear and objective picture of the video's composition and dynamics. No significant changes are needed.",
