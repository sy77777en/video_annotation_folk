    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a light gray, low-polygon digital bust is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. In the foreground, several blurry images of fast food items are scattered around the central figure, with some at the top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right of the frame. An overlay text is visible in the bottom left corner. The entire scene is set against a blurry gray background. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light gray, low-polygon digital bust of a person is positioned centrally. The figure, composed of flat, geometric planes, is faceless and lacks any detailed features such as hair or eyes, presenting only the general form of a head and shoulders facing forward. In front of this digital figure are several blurry, out-of-focus images of fast food items. These include multiple hamburgers, a red carton of french fries, and a red cup, all appearing to float in the space before the bust.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an abstract, digital scene with a blurry gray background, a low-polygon, gray, faceless humanoid figure is positioned in the center. Several out-of-focus images of fast food, including hamburgers, french fries, and a drink, float in front of the figure. An overlay text in the bottom left corner reads \"[1,2]: McDonald's Germany.\"**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It perfectly adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the visual information. It correctly identifies the shot size as a medium close-up, the central subject as a digital bust, and the surrounding elements as blurry food images and overlay text. The spatial positions (center, top left, etc.) and depth (foreground, middle ground, background) are all described correctly.\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It covers all the required aspects:\n    *   **Shot Size:** \"medium close-up shot\"\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It successfully assigns both a 2D position (e.g., \"center,\" \"bottom left\") and a 3D position (e.g., \"middle ground,\" \"foreground\") to the bust, the food items, the text, and the background.\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"positioned at the subject's level\"\n    *   **Dynamics:** \"The camera remains static\"\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the structural and stylistic rules precisely. It is a single, concise paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids emotional adjectives, speculation, and ambiguity. It focuses entirely on the spatial framing and dynamics as requested.",
