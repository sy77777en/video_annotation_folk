    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the scene opens with the camera angled downwards from a high position, looking at several motionless figures scattered across the rocky middle ground. A rifle is held in the bottom right foreground, with a vertical scale HUD element on the far left and an ammo count in the bottom right. The camera then pans up, transitioning the view from looking down to looking forward. As it pans, the figures on the ground move to the bottom of the frame, and a pile of sandbags comes into view in the left middle ground. The final framing reveals a semi-enclosed structure in the background with faint lights visible in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective through the green-tinted view of night vision, a modern assault rifle with a holographic sight is held in the foreground. In the area ahead, several human figures in combat-style clothing are lying motionless on the dirt ground in various positions. A subtitle at the bottom of the screen displays the text, \"Price: You're clear.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a scene at night through a green-tinted night vision scope. The perspective initially looks down at several bodies scattered on the dusty, rocky ground before panning up to reveal a semi-enclosed area under a simple roof. Piled sandbags form a makeshift fortification in this dark, hazy environment, with faint lights visible in the background. The character's rifle, featuring a holographic sight, is held in the foreground. A heads-up display is overlaid on the view, with a vertical scale on the left, an ammo count in the bottom right, and a subtitle at the bottom that reads, \"Price: You're clear.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively captures the first-person perspective and the core camera movement, but it could be more spatially precise. The initial description of the figures as being in the \"middle ground\" is inaccurate for a high-angle, downward-looking shot; they are in the foreground of the viewable area below the camera. The placement of the rifle and ammo count, both in the \"bottom right,\" should be differentiated: the rifle is a 3D model occupying the bottom right foreground, while the ammo count is a 2D UI element fixed to the bottom right corner. The term \"motionless figures\" is vague; if they are bodies, the caption should state that, as it's a key visual detail. Furthermore, the description of the camera's movement is generic; specifying the nature of the descent, such as a rapid drop or a controlled slide, would better describe the dynamics. The final framing lacks a crucial detail: it should explicitly state that after landing, the camera is at an eye-level height, establishing a standard ground-level perspective looking toward the structure in the background.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene opens from a first-person perspective with the camera angled steeply downward from a high position, revealing several motionless bodies scattered across the rocky foreground below. A rifle is held as a 3D model in the bottom right foreground, while an ammo count appears as a 2D UI element fixed to the bottom right corner. The camera then executes a controlled slide downward, transitioning the view from looking down to looking forward. As it pans, the bodies move to the bottom of the frame, and a pile of sandbags comes into view in the left middle ground. The final framing reveals a semi-enclosed structure in the background with faint lights visible in the distance, with the camera settling at an eye-level height, establishing a standard ground-level perspective.",
