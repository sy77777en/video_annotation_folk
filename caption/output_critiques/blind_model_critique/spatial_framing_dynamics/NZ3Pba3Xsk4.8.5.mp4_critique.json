    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, eye-level scenery shot from a first-person perspective. Initially, a wooden boardwalk is positioned in the left foreground, leading toward a paved path in the center middle ground. An animal enclosure with large rock formations occupies the left middle ground, with a building behind it in the background. The camera then pans smoothly to the right, causing the boardwalk to move out of the frame. The view settles on the paved path, which now runs from the bottom center toward the right. This movement reveals a new animal enclosure with a metal fence in the right middle ground, backed by another building and dense green trees in the background. Throughout the pan, the camera maintains a consistent eye-level height, simulating a walk through the park.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a scenery shot of a spacious and verdant zoo or park. The camera pans across a landscape featuring a combination of wooden boardwalks and wide, paved paths that wind through numerous leafy green trees and planters edged with natural stone. The animal enclosures are integrated into the environment with large, artificial rock formations and simple metal fences. The focus remains on the overall environment and its peaceful atmosphere, as the camera's sweeping movement captures the scale and design of the park rather than singling out any of the few visitors strolling through the area as a primary subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through an outdoor zoo or wildlife park during the daytime. The path transitions from a wooden boardwalk with metal railings to a wider, light-colored paved area. The park is filled with lush, green trees and planters bordered by rough stones. On the left, an animal enclosure features large, artificial rock formations and a tan-colored building. As the view pans right, another enclosure comes into view, fenced with metal railings, containing several deer in a dirt-floored area with a simple shelter. The sky is overcast, and a few other visitors are seen walking along the paths.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It successfully meets all the requirements of the instruction.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as a \"wide, eye-level scenery shot\" and accurately describes the elements within the scene (boardwalk, path, enclosures, buildings, trees). The description of the camera's smooth pan to the right and the resulting changes in the composition is precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It covers all the requested spatial aspects:\n    *   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"wide... scenery shot.\"\n    *   **Position (2D and 3D):** It effectively uses terms like \"left foreground,\" \"center middle ground,\" and \"right middle ground\" to describe both the 2D placement and 3D depth of multiple elements.\n    *   **Height:** It clearly states the camera is at a consistent \"eye-level height.\"\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** It expertly describes the camera movement (\"pans smoothly to the right\") and how this action affects the scene, detailing which elements move out of the frame (\"boardwalk to move out of the frame\") and which are revealed (\"reveals a new animal enclosure\").\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions perfectly.\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives, using objective descriptors like \"wooden,\" \"paved,\" and \"metal.\"\n    *   It makes no speculative statements (\"might be,\" \"appears\") and presents the information factually.\n    *   It focuses entirely on the spatial framing and dynamics as requested, providing a clear and concise analysis of the visual information. The final phrase, \"simulating a walk through the park,\" is an acceptable summary of the overall dynamic effect created by the first-person, eye-level pan.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video offers a wide, eye-level view from a first-person perspective. At the start, a wooden boardwalk appears in the left foreground, leading to a paved path in the center middle ground. An animal enclosure with large rock formations is situated in the left middle ground, with a building visible in the background. The camera smoothly pans to the right, moving the boardwalk out of the frame. The focus shifts to the paved path, now extending from the bottom center to the right. This reveals a new animal enclosure with a metal fence in the right middle ground, accompanied by another building and dense green trees in the background.
