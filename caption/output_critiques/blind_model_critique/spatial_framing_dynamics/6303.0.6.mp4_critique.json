    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a smartphone held by a person with medium to dark skin tone. The phone is centrally positioned in the frame, with the person's hands in the foreground. The hands, adorned with pink manicured nails and a large translucent orange ring, interact with the phone using the index finger. The phone screen displays three different app interfaces sequentially. The first interface, \"Space Vibes,\" is shown with cartoon planets, followed by \"Love Songs,\" and finally \"Hair Grooves\" with scissors imagery. The tiled floor with a checkerboard pattern is visible in the background, providing a contrasting backdrop. The camera is positioned above the subject, maintaining a consistent focus on the interaction between the hands and the phone throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up of a smartphone held by a person with medium to dark skin tone. The person has long, manicured nails painted pink and is wearing a light green sleeve. They are interacting with the phone using their index finger, which has a large, translucent orange ring. The phone screen displays three different app interfaces. The first shows a space-themed design with cartoon planets and the text \"Space Vibes.\" The second interface shows \"Love Songs\" with an option to add to a playlist, and the third displays an image of hair with scissors and the text \"Hair Grooves.\" The person's hand remains central to the video, emphasizing their interaction with the phone.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, set indoors with a tiled floor featuring a checkerboard pattern of dark and light squares. The time of day is not explicitly indicated, but the lighting suggests an evenly lit environment, possibly under artificial light. The main visual element is a smartphone held in the character's hands, displaying vibrant graphics on the screen. The phone's screen shows colorful, playful designs with text and icons, including planets and scissors, against dark backgrounds. The character's hands, adorned with rings and painted nails, interact with the phone, suggesting engagement with the content displayed. The setting is minimal, focusing on the interaction with the device, with no additional furniture or props visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good. It effectively and accurately follows the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption correctly identifies all key subjects and elements (hands, phone, floor) and their visual characteristics (manicured nails, ring, checkerboard pattern). It accurately describes the action (interacting with the phone) and the sequence of events (three different app interfaces appearing).\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption successfully incorporates all the required spatial details:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly starts by identifying the shot as a \"close-up.\"\n    *   **2D Position:** It specifies the phone is \"centrally positioned.\"\n    *   **3D Depth:** It clearly places the \"hands in the foreground\" and the \"tiled floor... in the background.\"\n    *   **Camera Height:** It explicitly states, \"The camera is positioned above the subject.\"\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** It describes the movement of the hands (\"interact with the phone using the index finger\") and the changes on the screen (\"displays three different app interfaces sequentially\"), while also noting the camera's stability (\"maintaining a consistent focus\").\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Structure and Tone:** The description is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It is concise yet informative, avoiding emotional language or speculative statements.\n    *   **Focus on Spatial Framing:** The entire description is built around the spatial relationships between the elements, using them as the primary framework to describe the scene, just as the instructions required.\n    *   **Essential Details:** While focusing on spatial framing, it includes other essential, non-speculative details (nail color, ring, app content) that make the description more vivid and complete without violating the core instructions.",
