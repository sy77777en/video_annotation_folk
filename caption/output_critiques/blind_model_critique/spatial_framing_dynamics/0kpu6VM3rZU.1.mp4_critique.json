    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot, capturing the main subject from the waist up. The woman in the shiny, metallic gold dress is positioned slightly off-center to the right in the foreground, while the interviewer with long brown hair stands to her left, also in the foreground. The trophy is held in the main subject's right hand, near the center of the frame. The interviewer holds the microphone labeled \"ET Canada\" towards the main subject. In the background, several formally dressed individuals are scattered across the middle ground, creating depth. The backdrop includes a large building with red and white circular patterns, visible in the top right and extending to the left side of the frame. A transparent tent-like structure with curtains is noticeable in the upper portion of the background. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium close-up, focusing more tightly on the main subject's upper body and face, which shifts her further to the center of the frame. The interviewer remains partially visible on the left side. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subjects throughout, ensuring a direct perspective. The overall spatial dynamics emphasize the interaction between the two women, with the background elements providing context for the event's setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman as the main subject, wearing a shiny, metallic gold dress with thin straps. She has long, straight black hair and is holding a trophy in her right hand. Her expression is animated, and she appears to be speaking into a microphone held by another woman. The secondary subject, a woman with long brown hair in an updo, is wearing a light-colored, embellished dress and is holding the microphone labeled \"ET Canada.\" In the background, several people are visible, dressed in formal attire, suggesting a red carpet event. The main focus is on the interaction between the two women, with the trophy being a notable element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a lively outdoor event, likely a red carpet gathering, set in an urban environment. The scene is viewed from a broadcast POV shot, typical of television production, providing a clear and structured view of the event. It takes place during the evening, as indicated by the artificial lighting illuminating the area. The background features a large building adorned with decorative posters in red and white circular patterns, possibly part of a commercial or entertainment complex. The setting is bustling with elegantly dressed attendees, suggesting a formal occasion. The event is held outside the building in a tent-like structure with a transparent roof and curtains. Notable visual elements include a prominent red carpet and a backdrop with reflective surfaces. Overlays are present, including a logo and text identifying the broadcast network, positioned at the bottom left corner of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It perfectly adheres to all instructions, providing a detailed and accurate analysis of the video's spatial composition and dynamics.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption uses technical terms like \"medium shot,\" \"medium close-up,\" \"foreground,\" and \"middle ground\" correctly. It accurately describes the 2D positions (off-center right, left, center) and 3D depth of all key subjects and elements, from the main subject to the background crowd and structures.\n\n*   **Completeness:** It successfully covers every required aspect from the instructions:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It clearly states the initial \"medium shot\" and the transition to a \"medium close-up.\"\n    *   **Position:** It meticulously details the 2D and 3D positions of the main subject, the interviewer, the trophy, the microphone, the background crowd, and the backdrop architecture.\n    *   **Depth:** It explicitly mentions that the background individuals create depth.\n    *   **Camera Height:** It correctly notes that the camera is at a \"level height\" relative to the subjects.\n    *   **Changes/Dynamics:** It expertly describes the transition to a tighter shot and how this changes the main subject's framing, shifting her more to the center.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is dense with information but remains clear and easy to read.\n    *   **Objective and Factual:** It avoids emotional or subjective language (\"shiny, metallic gold\" is a factual description of appearance, not an emotional judgment) and refrains from any speculation.\n    *   **Structure and Flow:** The description follows a logical order, starting with the overall shot, detailing the elements within it, and then describing the dynamic changes. The final sentence effectively summarizes the spatial purpose of the framing.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.",
