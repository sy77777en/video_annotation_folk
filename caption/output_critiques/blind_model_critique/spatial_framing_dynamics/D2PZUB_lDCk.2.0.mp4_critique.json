    "pre_caption": "In this abstract scene, a dynamic landscape composed of shimmering golden particles occupies the bottom third of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. A bright, concentrated glow emanates from the bottom center of this landscape, acting as a focal point in the foreground/middle ground. Numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rise from this landscape, positioned across the middle ground and extending towards the top of the frame in the background. Smaller, scattered points of light populate the middle and upper portions of the frame, primarily in the background, and appear to drift upwards alongside the vertical lines. The overall framing remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents an abstract, animated scene enriched with golden light effects. At the bottom, a wavy surface composed of dense, shimmering golden particles forms a dynamic landscape. From this surface, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light ascend towards the top of the frame, varying in height and intensity. Some lines culminate in a brighter point of light. Scattered throughout the dark upper portion of the scene are smaller, individual points of golden and white light, resembling stars or floating particles. A prominent, bright golden glow emanates from the center of the particle landscape near the bottom, serving as a focal point from which some light rays appear to originate.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an abstract scene against a dark brown background dotted with faint golden particles. Below, a surface made of shimmering, golden particles forms gentle, wave-like undulations, glowing brightly near the center. From this surface, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light ascend towards the top of the frame, varying in length and brightness. Smaller, bright golden particles are scattered throughout, appearing to float and move upwards with the light streaks.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the key visual elements and their static framing, but it lacks specificity regarding the scene's scale and depth. It fails to define the shot size, which could be described as a medium shot of the abstract phenomenon. The description of spatial position is too two-dimensional; it could be enhanced by detailing the 3D layering, for instance, by placing the scattered points of light in the foreground, the rising vertical lines in the middle ground, and the shimmering landscape in the background to create a clearer sense of depth. Furthermore, the description of movement is generic. The \"shimmering\" could be more precisely described as a slow, horizontal, wave-like undulation within the particle landscape, and the central glow could be noted as pulsing subtly in brightness. Finally, the caption omits the camera's angle, which appears to be straight-on and at eye-level with the center of the activity, a detail that would complete the spatial analysis.",
