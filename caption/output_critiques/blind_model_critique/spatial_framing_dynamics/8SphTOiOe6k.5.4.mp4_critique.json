    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a bustling street scene. In the foreground, on the left side, a silver car drives out of the frame, followed by a light blue car. Pedestrians, including men and women in casual attire and face masks, walk along the sidewalk on the left, occupying the middle ground. A red vending machine is positioned near a shop entrance on the right, in the middle ground. Traditional-style buildings line the street in the background, with some people standing near a shop entrance. As the scene progresses, a silver car with a visible license plate drives down the street from the right to the left, while a black and white car moves in the opposite direction. The camera is positioned at the height of the pedestrians, maintaining a consistent view of the lively street dynamics.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a bustling street scene with various people and vehicles. All individuals, including men and women, are walking along the sidewalk, dressed in casual attire with jackets and face masks. At the beginning, a silver car drives out of the frame from the left side, followed by a light blue car with a visible license plate. Subsequently, a silver car is seen driving down the street with a visible license plate, while a black and white car travels in the opposite direction. The street is lined with traditional-style buildings, and a few people are seen standing near a shop entrance. The overall atmosphere is lively, with a mix of pedestrians and vehicles moving through the area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person point of view, capturing a lively street scene in a quaint outdoor setting. The time of day is likely afternoon, with a clear sky and scattered clouds. The environment features traditional Japanese architecture, with wooden buildings lining the street, some displaying signs and banners. A notable element is a bright red vending machine positioned near a shop entrance. The street is bustling with pedestrians, all of them wearing masks, walking along the sidewalk. At the beginning, a silver car drives out of frame from the left side, followed by a light blue car with a visible license plate. Then, a silver car with a visible license plate drives down the street, and a black and white car also drives down the street in the opposite direction. The road is bordered by a narrow curb. Trees with autumn foliage add a touch of color to the scene, and the overall atmosphere is vibrant and dynamic, with people moving about and vehicles passing by.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that very effectively follows the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured. However, there are minor areas where it could be improved for stricter adherence.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot size, the various subjects (cars, pedestrians, vending machine, buildings), their specific 2D and 3D positions within the frame, and their movements. The description of cars moving in and out of the frame and across the street is precise.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully addresses all the required components from the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"wide shot.\"\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It does an excellent job of assigning both a 2D position (left, right) and a 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background) to multiple elements in the scene.\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** It clearly describes the movement of cars and pedestrians, including their direction (\"drives out of the frame,\" \"from the right to the left\").\n*   **Camera Height:** It correctly states the camera's height relative to the subjects (\"at the height of the pedestrians\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres to the vast majority of the instructions, but there are two minor points for improvement:\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It avoids speculation, ambiguity, and emotional language for the most part.\n    *   It follows the requested structure, starting with shot size and integrating position, depth, and movement.\n    *   It uses simple, natural English.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The words \"bustling\" and \"lively\" are subjective interpretations of the scene's atmosphere. A more neutral description, such as \"a street with vehicle and pedestrian traffic,\" would align more strictly with the goal of describing only spatial dynamics.\n    *   **Non-Spatial Details:** The caption includes descriptive details that are not strictly related to spatial framing, such as \"men and women in casual attire and face masks\" and \"Traditional-style buildings.\" While these details help visualize the scene, the core instruction is to focus on **spatial framing and dynamics**. A more concise version might simply say \"pedestrians\" and \"buildings\" to keep the focus entirely on their position and movement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is very good and fulfills its purpose exceptionally well. The points for improvement are minor and relate to a very strict interpretation of the instructions. It successfully translates a dynamic visual scene into a clear, objective, and spatially-aware text description.",
