    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on a hand interacting with a control panel. Initially, the hand occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground, while the control panel is directly beneath it, also in the foreground. The hand, located in the middle of the frame, moves slightly as it adjusts the dials. The control panel, featuring illuminated buttons and displays, is situated in the lower part of the frame. Midway through the video, the camera shifts focus to reveal a screen in the background, which is now centered in the frame. This screen, displaying technical data and graphics, is positioned further back in the middle ground. The transition from the hand and control panel to the screen occurs smoothly, maintaining the close-up shot size. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, capturing the detailed interaction and subsequent display change without altering its height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up of a hand interacting with a control panel. The hand, with a light skin tone, is adjusting dials on a device that resembles a vintage radio or communication equipment. The hand is wearing a dark, ribbed sleeve, suggesting a sweater or jacket. The device has illuminated buttons and displays, with orange and red lights indicating active settings. After the midway point, a screen is revealed displaying technical data and graphics, possibly related to navigation or communication. The overall scene is dimly lit, with a focus on the interaction between the hand and the equipment, highlighting the technological and manual aspects of the setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a dimly lit, high-tech environment. The scene features a hand interacting with electronic equipment, including a radio and a screen displaying data. The equipment is characterized by dark metallic surfaces with illuminated buttons and dials, emitting a warm orange glow. The screen shows complex graphics and text, suggesting a technical or control room atmosphere. The lighting is low, creating a moody ambiance with shadows and focused highlights on the devices. The overall color scheme is a mix of dark tones with contrasting bright lights, enhancing the technological and slightly mysterious feel of the setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of depth is potentially inaccurate, as a hand in the \"foreground\" interacting with a control panel in the \"middle ground\" is spatially unlikely; both would typically occupy the foreground in a close-up. The initial framing is also slightly contradictory, placing the hand in the \"center\" while the panel it interacts with is on the \"left.\" A more plausible composition would be the hand and panel sharing the center-left of the frame. The most significant ambiguity lies in the transition; \"shifts focus to reveal another screen\" is vague. A focus pull would not re-center the screen in the frame, so this likely describes a camera movement, such as a pan or tilt, which should be specified. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention what happens to the hand during this transition—whether it exits the frame or remains visible. Finally, describing the second screen as \"further back in the middle ground\" might be an overstatement if it's part of the same console, and the camera height being \"at the subject's level\" is less probable than a slightly high angle looking down onto the panel.",
