    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot. An extreme wide shot captures the top of a large, industrial bridge structure from a static, high-angle perspective. The metallic, triangular framework is positioned in the center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. The entire scene is enveloped by thick, swirling fog that fills the foreground, middle ground, and background, constantly shifting to obscure and reveal parts of the structure. The only discernible movement within the static frame is the drifting fog and tiny vehicles traveling from left to right across the bridge deck below the central truss.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an atmospheric, aerial scenery shot of a massive industrial bridge spanning over water. The focus is not on a specific subject but rather on the overwhelming environment, creating a sense of mystery and immense scale. A large, metallic, truss-like framework with a peaked roofline looms in the center, its full form obscured by thick, swirling grey fog that dominates the entire view, making the structure appear ethereal and ghost-like.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a high-angle view of a large, industrial metal bridge shrouded in thick, swirling grey fog or steam. The top of the bridge, which has a triangular, truss-like framework, is partially visible through the dense vapor. Cars can be seen traveling from left to right across the bridge, appearing small due to the camera's distance. The entire scene is monochromatic, dominated by shades of grey, as the fog obscures the surrounding environment and the base of the bridge.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the camera's leftward movement conflicts with the statement that the bridge remains in the center of the frame; if the camera is moving, the bridge's position within the frame should shift from right to left, a key dynamic that is missing. The phrase \"appears to be constructed over water\" is speculative and should be replaced with a definitive statement about the water's visibility or how it is obscured by the fog. Furthermore, the description of movement could be more dynamic by detailing the parallax effect: the leftward camera motion would cause the foreground fog to move across the frame more rapidly than the middle-ground bridge, which in turn would move faster than the background, enhancing the sense of depth. Finally, the description of the fog \"appearing to continue into the background\" is also speculative; it would be more accurate to describe the fog's visible density and how it affects the clarity of elements in the middle ground and background, such as partially obscuring the bridge's lower structure or the water below it.",

The metallic, triangular framework remains centered in the frame, enveloped by thick, swirling fog that fills the foreground, middle ground, and background. The fog constantly shifts, obscuring and revealing parts of the structure, while tiny vehicles travel from left to right across the bridge deck below the central truss. The bridge is constructed over water, though the fog's density partially obscures the view of the water below. The fog's movement creates a dynamic parallax effect, with the foreground fog drifting across the frame more rapidly than the middle-ground bridge, enhancing the sense of depth. The fog's density affects the clarity of elements, partially obscuring the bridge's lower structure and the water beneath it.",
