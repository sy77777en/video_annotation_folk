    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, static scenery shot captured from a ground-level perspective. The textured pavement, which sparkles with light, occupies the entire foreground and the bottom half of the frame. In the middle ground, a two-story house is positioned on the left, while a taller, tower-like structure stands in the center. Other buildings are visible to the right and further back in the middle ground. The background is composed of rolling hills that stretch across the upper portion of the frame, with a large, bright sun located in the top center, just above the horizon. Small, dark particles drift slowly downwards throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a serene, rural scene of an empty street in a snow-covered town at sunrise or sunset. The shot features a level perspective, showcasing clearly visible buildings, including a two-story house and a central tower, lining the road against a backdrop of rolling hills. A large, brilliant sun hangs low in the sky, casting a warm, hazy glow and causing the textured pavement in the foreground to sparkle, while small, dark particles drift down through the air. The composition emphasizes the overall mood and environment, with a medium depth of field highlighting the texture of the ground and the atmospheric lighting rather than any specific building or character.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A level-angle shot captures a deserted town at either sunrise or sunset. The camera is positioned on a textured ground surface, which appears dark due to the camera's dark corners, and is covered in small, glistening particles. In the distance, several buildings, including a clearly visible two-story house and a taller structure with a small tower, stand against a bright, glowing sun on the horizon. The surrounding hilly landscape is covered in a light-colored layer, and small, dark specks float through the air, resembling white granular drifts.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively establishes the scene's layers, but it could be more precise about the \"dynamic\" nature of the shot and the interplay of its elements. The term \"dynamic\" suggests camera movement, yet none is described; if the camera is, for example, slowly dollying forward across the pavement, this would be a critical detail to include as it changes the spatial relationship between the viewer and the buildings. The description of \"small, dark particles\" is vague; specifying if they are glowing embers or soft ash would add significant context to the scene's atmosphere. Furthermore, while the \"ground-level perspective\" is noted, the pavement occupying the entire bottom half implies a distinct low-angle shot, which should be stated to better convey how the buildings are framed to appear imposing. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the effect of the \"large, bright sun,\" such as long shadows cast by the buildings across the sparkling foreground or the silhouetting of the tower against the sky, which are key details in defining the scene's depth and form.",
