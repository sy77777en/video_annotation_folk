    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot of an empty, narrow, green train corridor. Initially, there are no subjects in view, focusing on the corridor's length and details such as the patterned floor and windows on the right side. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level. As the video progresses, a door near the far end of the corridor opens, revealing two men entering from the background. They begin walking towards the camera, gradually moving from the background into the middle ground. The first man, carrying a wrapped object resembling a tree, is slightly ahead on the left side of the frame, while the second man, holding a white object, follows closely behind on the right. Both men are centered horizontally as they approach. By the end of the video, they are closer to the camera, filling more of the frame and becoming the primary focus. The camera maintains its position throughout, capturing the men's movement along the corridor without any change in angle or height. The spatial dynamics highlight the transition from an empty corridor to one occupied by the two men as they walk forward.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with an empty narrow, green train corridor. A door opens, and two men enter the frame. The first man is wearing a green cap, green pants, a white short-sleeved shirt with a tie, and a dark green vest. He carries a wrapped object that resembles a tree. The second man is dressed in a dark coat, green pants, a white shirt with a tie, and a Santa hat. He holds a white object, the nature of which is unclear. The corridor features a patterned floor and windows on the right side, enhancing the vintage train ambiance. As the men move closer to the camera, their attire and the objects they carry become more visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts the interior of a vintage train carriage with a long, narrow corridor. The setting is indoors, characterized by pale green walls and a matching ceiling with subtle, curved lines. The floor features a patterned design with alternating shapes, adding texture to the scene. Large windows line one side of the corridor, allowing natural light to filter in, suggesting daytime. The train's interior has a retro aesthetic, with doors and panels that have a metallic finish. The scene includes individuals moving through the corridor, adding a sense of motion and activity within the confined space.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a wide shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption that successfully captures most of the required information. However, it can be improved in a few key areas to better align with the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of the scene (wide shot, green corridor, windows on the right), the subjects' appearance (entering from a door in the background), and their movement (walking towards the camera from background to middle ground) is accurate.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** The phrase \"resembling a tree\" is a speculative interpretation. The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid speculative statements\" and \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" A more compliant description would be \"a tall, wrapped object.\"\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Very Complete:** The caption successfully covers all the required elements:\n    *   **Shot Size:** Correctly identifies the \"wide shot\" at the start.\n    *   **Position (2D/3D):** Effectively describes the subjects' positions (left/right, background/middle ground) and their movement through these spatial planes.\n    *   **Depth:** Clearly conveys the depth of the corridor and the subjects' movement within it.\n    *   **Camera Height:** Mentions the camera is at the subjects' level.\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** Excellently describes the transition from an empty scene to one with approaching subjects, noting how they fill more of the frame over time.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional adjectives.\n    *   It correctly focuses on spatial framing and movement as the primary goal.\n    *   It clearly describes the \"revealing\" of the subjects from the door.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Avoid Speculation:** As mentioned, \"resembling a tree\" violates a key instruction.\n    *   **Conciseness and Redundancy:** The final two sentences are slightly redundant. The point that the camera is stationary is made, and the last sentence (\"The spatial dynamics highlight...\") is more of a summary analysis than a direct description. These could be combined or streamlined for better conciseness.\n    *   **Logical Flow:** Stating \"The camera remains stationary at the subject's level\" before the subjects have even appeared is slightly out of sequence. It's better to describe the camera's static nature and then its height relative to the subjects once they are in the frame.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is **good** and demonstrates a strong understanding of the task. It accurately describes the complex spatial dynamics of the scene. To be **excellent**, it needs to eliminate the minor speculative detail and refine its structure for better conciseness and logical flow.",
