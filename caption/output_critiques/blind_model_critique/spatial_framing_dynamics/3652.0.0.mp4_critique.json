    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a stylized puppet character seated at a table. The puppet occupies the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground. Its upper body, from the waist up, is visible. The table with two blue cups on a tray is directly in front of the puppet, also in the foreground. The puppet's hand gestures change slightly, moving from a resting position to pointing upwards. In the background, blurred figures and elements suggest a busy dining area, with one figure sitting on a stool in the middle ground towards the right. Yellow caution tape runs horizontally across the background, adding depth to the scene. The camera maintains a steady position at the puppet's level throughout the sequence, keeping the focus on the puppet's actions and expressions. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a stylized puppet character with exaggerated facial features, including large eyes and a prominent nose. The puppet has short, dark hair, black eyebrows, and is wearing a red plaid jacket over a light-colored shirt with green lettering. It is seated at a table with two blue cups on a tray. The puppet's head is turned slightly, suggesting it is looking to the side. The setting appears to be a dining area, but the focus remains on the puppet character.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting resembling a cafeteria or dining area. The environment features tables with trays and cups, suggesting a casual dining atmosphere. The scene includes a character seated at a table, with a focus on their interaction with the surroundings. The background shows blurred figures and elements, indicating a busy or populated area. The lighting is bright, typical of indoor settings, with a mix of warm and cool tones. Notable visual elements include the character's red plaid jacket and the blue and white cups on the table. The setting is enhanced by the presence of yellow caution tape in the background, adding a distinct visual element. Overlays include a small logo in the bottom left corner, indicating branding or network identification.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as a medium shot, places the puppet in the center foreground, and accurately describes the placement of the table, cups, background figures, and caution tape. The description of the puppet's minor hand movement is also precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very thorough. It successfully covers all the required elements:\n    *   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"medium shot\" and further clarified (\"upper body, from the waist up\").\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It effectively maps out the scene by providing both the 2D position (center, right) and 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background) for the puppet, table, a background figure, and the caution tape.\n    *   **Camera Height:** It clearly states the camera is \"at the puppet's level.\"\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** It notes the small movement of the puppet's hand while also confirming the static nature of the camera and the overall framing.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions almost perfectly.\n    *   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   It focuses strictly on spatial framing and dynamics, avoiding emotional language or speculation. For example, it uses the descriptive term \"stylized\" rather than a subjective one.\n    *   It correctly identifies the main subject (the puppet) and describes its framing in detail while also including secondary elements to provide a complete picture of the scene's composition and depth.\n    *   The structure follows the requested format: starting with shot size, then detailing the spatial positions of elements, and concluding with camera height and movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a medium shot of a stylized puppet character seated at a table, centrally positioned in the foreground. The puppet's upper body, visible from the waist up, is the focal point. In front of the puppet, a table holds two blue cups on a tray, also in the foreground. The puppet's hand gestures subtly shift from resting to pointing upwards. In the background, blurred figures and elements suggest a bustling dining area, with one figure on a stool in the middle ground to the right. Yellow caution tape runs horizontally across the background, adding depth. The camera remains steady at the puppet's level throughout, maintaining focus on the puppet's actions and expressions, with no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning.",
