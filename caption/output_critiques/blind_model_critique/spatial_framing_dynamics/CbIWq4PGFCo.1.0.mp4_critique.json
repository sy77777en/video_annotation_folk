    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot frames a young man in the center foreground. The camera remains static at his eye level, capturing his head and shoulders. Behind him, the middle ground features an out-of-focus, sandy landscape, with dark, shadowed mounds of earth in the background. There are no changes in the shot size or the subject's position throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, fair-skinned man with short, curly brown hair is shown in a close-up. He wears a dark-colored t-shirt. His face has some dirt on it, and his eyes are red-rimmed and appear watery. He looks downward with a somber expression as his face is partially lit from the side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a desolate, outdoor landscape under warm, directional light. The ground is an uneven, sandy surface of a light brown color. In the out-of-focus background, dark, irregular mounds of earth or rock are cast in deep shadow. A strong light source from the side illuminates the foreground, creating a high-contrast environment where a young man is seated.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the close-up shot and the counterclockwise camera movement, it oversimplifies the spatial dynamics and contains a significant inaccuracy. The statement that there are \"no changes in... the subject's position\" is incorrect; although the man is stationary, the camera's arc fundamentally alters his perceived position and orientation within the frame. In the video, the shot begins with the man in a three-quarter view, looking slightly to the right of the camera, and as the camera orbits, his head turns in relation to the viewer, ending in a near-profile view. This change in perspective is a crucial element of the shot's dynamic. Additionally, the description of the background is too static. The camera's movement creates a clear parallax effect, causing the out-of-focus mounds and sandy terrain to slide from right to left behind the subject, which is a key visual detail that should be included to accurately describe the scene's depth and movement.",

This dynamic shift in perspective is a key element of the shot. In the middle ground, an out-of-focus, sandy landscape features dark, shadowed mounds of earth.
