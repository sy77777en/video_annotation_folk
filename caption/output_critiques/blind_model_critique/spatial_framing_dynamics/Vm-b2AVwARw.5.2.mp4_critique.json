    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium full shot, captured from a high angle, showing a woman with a vacuum cleaner in the right foreground. A large kitchen island with three stools occupies the center middle ground, extending from the left of the frame. In the background, dark cabinetry, built-in appliances, and a long light fixture are visible across the top portion of the scene. As the shot progresses, the camera slowly moves in and lowers, transitioning to a medium shot of the woman, now framed at her level. She remains positioned in the right half of the frame, with the kitchen island and background elements still visible but less prominent.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with short black hair and pale, greyish skin stands holding a vacuum cleaner. She is wearing a blue, long-sleeved blazer over a white top and light-colored pants. Her head is tilted down, and she has a downcast expression as she looks towards the vacuum. The vacuum is a light-colored canister model with a black, flexible hose, which she holds by the handle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a modern kitchen featuring dark wood cabinetry, a light wood parquet floor, and grey, textured walls resembling marble or unfinished concrete. A large, grey central kitchen island is equipped with a built-in cooktop and has three U-shaped, light wood stools tucked underneath. A small white bowl is located on the bottom right side of the kitchen island. A long, thin, modern light fixture hangs over the island. In the background, a stainless steel range hood and built-in appliances are visible. A person with grey, stone-like skin, wearing a blue jacket, stands in the room holding a vacuum cleaner. Overlay text \"[27]\" appears in the bottom left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good structural overview, but it could be more precise in several areas. The initial \"medium full shot\" might be better described as a wide shot, as the woman and her vacuum appear on the right side of the frame, sharing focus with the large kitchen environment. Her position might be more accurately placed in the right-middle ground, with the corner of the kitchen island occupying the immediate left foreground. The description of the background cabinetry as being in the \"top portion\" is vague; it would be clearer to state that the cabinets occupy the entire background wall. A key omission is the woman's own movement; the caption implies she is static, but she actually vacuums from the right edge toward the center of the frame as the camera pushes in. Finally, instead of saying the background elements become \"less prominent,\" it would be more descriptive to note that the camera's movement crops the left side of the island and the shallowing depth of field softens the focus on the background cabinetry, isolating the woman in the final medium shot.",
