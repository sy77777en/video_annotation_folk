    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, static scenery shot. A large, golden-bronze statue occupies the foreground, positioned across the bottom half of the frame from the left towards the center. In the middle ground, the Seine River flows horizontally across the scene, with other bridges and city lights visible along its banks. The illuminated Eiffel Tower is centered in the background, rising above the cityscape. The camera is positioned at a high angle relative to the river below but at a similar height to the foreground statue. A text overlay is fixed in the bottom right corner of the frame. The shot remains stationary throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a breathtaking cityscape scenery shot of Paris at night, viewed from the Pont Alexandre III. In the foreground, a large, ornate golden-bronze statue of a male figure adorned with a laurel wreath gazes out over the scene. Beyond the statue, the dark Seine River reflects the shimmering golden lights of the city, with several other bridges visible in the mid-ground. The background is dominated by the brilliantly illuminated Eiffel Tower, which stands as a beacon against the dark night sky, surrounded by the sprawling, lit-up Parisian landscape. The shot does not have a single main subject; instead, its focus is on capturing the grand scale, romantic atmosphere, and iconic beauty of the Parisian environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor night scene in Paris is captured from a bridge overlooking the Seine River. In the distance, the illuminated Eiffel Tower stands against the dark sky, with city lights lining the riverbanks. The foreground is dominated by a large, ornate, golden-bronze statue of a figure wearing a laurel wreath, its metallic surface reflecting the ambient light. The dark water of the river below shows shimmering reflections from the city and other distant bridges. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" written below it.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the key subjects and their general placement, but it lacks detail on the dynamic spatial changes caused by the camera movement. While it mentions a zoom and a roll, it fails to describe how these actions alter the framing of the subjects. For instance, as the camera zooms in, the foreground statue does not remain static in the frame but actually shifts from the bottom-left quadrant toward the bottom edge, becoming less prominent. The description of the middle ground is also too generic; it misses the brightly lit tour boat that moves from right to left across the Seine, providing a key horizontal dynamic. Furthermore, the camera is not at a simple \"level angle\" but is at a high angle relative to the river and the statue, while simultaneously being at a low angle looking up at the Eiffel Tower. The caption should also specify the result of the zoom, clarifying that the shot transitions from a wide shot to a medium-long shot focused on the Eiffel Tower, which itself moves from being slightly right-of-center to perfectly centered by the end of the shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a dynamic scenery shot featuring a large, golden-bronze statue in the foreground, initially positioned across the bottom-left quadrant of the frame. As the camera zooms in, the statue shifts toward the bottom edge, becoming less prominent. In the middle ground, the Seine River flows horizontally, with a brightly lit tour boat moving from right to left, adding a key horizontal dynamic. The illuminated Eiffel Tower rises in the background, initially slightly right-of-center. The camera, positioned at a high angle relative to the river and statue, simultaneously looks up at the Eiffel Tower from a low angle. The zoom transitions the shot from a wide to a medium-long shot, perfectly centering the Eiffel Tower by the end. A text overlay is fixed in the bottom right corner of the frame. The shot remains stationary throughout, despite the zoom and roll.",
