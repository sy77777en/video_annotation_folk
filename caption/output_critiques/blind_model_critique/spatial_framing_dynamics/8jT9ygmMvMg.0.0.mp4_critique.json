    "pre_caption": "This scenery shot opens with an extreme wide shot of Venice from a high-angle, bird's-eye perspective, which transitions into a wide shot as the camera flies forward and descends. The Grand Canal runs vertically through the center of the frame, with the white Rialto Bridge positioned in the center middle ground, and the camera moves steadily towards it. Dense city buildings with red-tiled roofs fill the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. In the canal, several long white boats and smaller vessels are visible in the middle ground, some moving and others docked along the banks. The sun is positioned in the top right background, illuminating the cityscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a sweeping aerial cityscape scenery shot of Venice, Italy, captured during a golden sunset. The camera glides down the Grand Canal, moving towards the iconic, white stone Rialto Bridge with its distinct arches. The city's dense architecture, characterized by buildings with red-tiled roofs, is bathed in the warm, low-angled light of the setting sun. On the dark green water of the canal, several long, white water buses (vaporettos) are docked or moving, alongside smaller motorboats and gondolas. There is no single main subject in this shot. The focus is instead on conveying the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the entire urban landscape, emphasizing the unique interplay of historic architecture, water, and light that defines the city.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective of Venice, Italy, during a golden sunrise. The camera descends over the city's dense cluster of buildings, which feature terracotta-tiled roofs and facades in shades of yellow and orange. The view centers on the Grand Canal, where the iconic Rialto Bridge, a large, white stone structure with arches, spans the dark green water. Several boats, including long white water buses and smaller wooden motorboats, are visible on the canal, some docked along the sides and others navigating the waterway.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the key elements and the overall camera movement, it describes the scene in a somewhat static manner that doesn't fully capture the dynamic changes during the continuous shot. For instance, the Rialto Bridge is described as being at the \"center top,\" but as the camera flies forward and descends, the bridge would move down in the frame, transitioning towards the center. Similarly, describing the Grand Canal as running \"vertically through the center\" is an oversimplification; its perspective would shift and curve as the camera's altitude and angle change. The description of the buildings could be more dynamic by noting how the foreground structures at the bottom of the frame move past and out of view, creating a parallax effect that enhances the sense of depth and forward motion. Finally, while the movement of boats is mentioned, the caption could specify their movement relative to the camera's path, such as how they appear to travel from the middle ground toward the bottom of the frame as the camera advances over them.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot of Venice from a high-angle, bird's-eye perspective, dynamically transitioning into a wide shot as the camera flies forward and descends. The Grand Canal, initially appearing to run vertically through the center, shifts and curves with the camera's changing altitude and angle. The iconic white Rialto Bridge, initially positioned in the center middle ground, gradually moves downward in the frame as the camera approaches. Dense city buildings with red-tiled roofs fill the left and right sides, creating a parallax effect as foreground structures move past and out of view, enhancing the sense of depth and forward motion. In the canal, several long white boats and smaller vessels are visible, some moving and others docked along the banks, appearing to travel from the middle ground toward the bottom of the frame as the camera advances over them. The sun, positioned in the top right background, casts a warm glow over the cityscape, illuminating the dynamic scene.",
