    "pre_caption": "This video uses a wide shot. Initially, a white egret is positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, crouched low amongst green grass on a bank next to a body of water. The water occupies the foreground and middle ground, filling the bottom and left portions of the frame. The grassy bank is in the middle ground on the right side. The egret briefly raises its head, then turns and walks away from the water's edge, moving towards the top right of the frame and further into the middle ground before leaving the shot. The camera is positioned at the egret's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a white egret with long legs and a slender neck, standing on a patch of dense green grass by the edge of a calm body of water. Initially, the egret is positioned with its head lowered, likely searching for food in the water. After a moment, the egret turns around and leaves. Its smooth, bright feathers contrast with the surrounding greenery. The water reflects the scene, adding a serene quality to the setting. The egret's presence is the focal point, highlighting its interaction with the natural environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene at the edge of a calm body of water with greenish, reflective water. A bank covered in dense green grass and some taller, drier reeds runs along the water's edge. A white egret with a long yellow beak is positioned amongst the grass on the bank. Initially, the bird is crouched low, looking down towards the water as if searching for food. It then begins to turn its body and walks to the right, moving upward along the riverbank and away from the water’s edge, leaving the calm water and grassy area behind. The scene occurs during daylight hours.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is the feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is excellent and serves as a model example of how to follow the provided instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot size as a wide shot, the subject as a white egret, and the key environmental elements like the water and grassy bank. The description of the egret's initial position, its movement, and its exit from the frame is precise and factually correct based on the video's content.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully addresses all the required components of the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"wide shot.\"\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It effectively describes the 2D position (right side, bottom, left) and 3D depth (foreground, middle ground) for the egret, the water, and the bank.\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** The movement of the egret is described in detail, including its change in direction (\"turns and walks away\"), path (\"towards the top right\"), and final action (\"leaving the shot\").\n*   **Camera Height:** It correctly states that the camera is \"at the egret's level.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres perfectly to all stylistic and structural rules:\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   It is concise yet informative, focusing only on essential spatial details.\n*   It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"seems to be\").\n*   It follows the logical structure of describing the initial framing, the elements within it, and then the movement that occurs.",
