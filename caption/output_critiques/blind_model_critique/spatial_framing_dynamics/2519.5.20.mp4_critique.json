    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on the upper bodies and hands of two individuals. The person on the left, wearing a dark green sweater, occupies the left side of the frame, with their hands prominently displayed in the foreground as they manipulate a small object. This individual's left wrist, adorned with a watch, and left hand, featuring a ring, are clearly visible. The person on the right, dressed in a white shirt with blue stripes, is positioned slightly to the right and further back in the frame, with their hands also in the foreground but less active. An open container with additional items lies in the bottom left corner of the frame, near the person in the green sweater. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective that emphasizes the interaction between the two individuals and the objects they handle. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two people engaged in an activity. The person on the left, wearing a dark green sweater with a textured pattern, is seated and focused on handling a small object, possibly a bandage, with both hands. Their hands are prominent, showing a watch on the left wrist and a ring on the left hand. The person on the right, wearing a white shirt with blue horizontal stripes, is also seated and appears to be observing or assisting. A small, open container with additional items is visible, suggesting a shared task or interaction between the two.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, intimate atmosphere. The environment is softly lit, suggesting a cozy room. The focus is on two individuals engaged in a quiet, personal interaction. The person facing the camera is wearing a textured, dark green sweater, while the individual on the right side of the frame is in a striped shirt. They are handling a small, transparent container with bandages, indicating a moment of care or attention. The person in the sweater is holding the bandages and peeling off the backing of one. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, providing a detached, observational perspective on the interaction. The overall tone is calm and focused, with the lighting and setting enhancing the sense of a private, thoughtful moment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that very closely follows the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres well to the required style and content.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why it is a good caption:\n\n**Strengths (What the caption does well):**\n\n*   **Adherence to Core Instructions:** The caption's primary focus is on spatial framing and dynamics, successfully describing shot size, 2D/3D position, and relative height as requested.\n*   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the \"close-up shot\" at the beginning and specifies what part of the subjects is visible (\"upper bodies and hands\").\n*   **Spatial Positioning (2D and 3D):** It effectively breaks down the scene, assigning 2D positions (left, right, bottom left) and 3D depth (foreground, further back) to both subjects and key elements like the container.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It avoids jargon and emotional adjectives, resulting in a clear and informative description.\n*   **Completeness:** It covers all the required components, including the camera's height (\"at the subjects' level\") and explicitly notes the absence of changes in framing (\"no noticeable changes... during the sequence\"), which is a crucial detail.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\") and subjective commentary, sticking to what is visibly present in the frame.\n\n**Minor Areas for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Slightly Contradictory Depth Description:** The phrase \"positioned slightly to the right and further back in the frame, with their hands also in the foreground\" could be slightly clearer. While the meaning is understandable (their torso is back, but hands are forward), it could be phrased more precisely, such as: \"The person on the right is positioned with their body further back in the scene, though their hands extend forward into the foreground.\"\n*   **Interpretive Clause:** The clause \"maintaining a consistent perspective that emphasizes the interaction\" borders on interpretation. The instructions ask for a description of the framing, not its effect. A more neutral alternative would be: \"The camera remains static at the subjects' level throughout the video.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOverall, the caption is of very high quality. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions by systematically detailing the spatial composition of the scene in a neutral, clear, and comprehensive manner. The minor points for improvement are subtle refinements rather than significant errors.",
