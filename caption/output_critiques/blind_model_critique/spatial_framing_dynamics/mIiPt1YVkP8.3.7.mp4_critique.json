    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot captured from a high angle, the scene presents a nighttime view of an airport. Numerous out-of-focus lights are scattered across the foreground, middle ground, and background. In the middle ground, the silhouettes of stationary airplanes are visible on the left and right sides of the frame. An airplane with bright lights begins in the middle ground on the right, moves horizontally toward the center, and then ascends, flying diagonally toward the top left and receding into the background as it passes over the other aircraft.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This grainy, black-and-white nighttime video captures a scene at an airport. An airplane, identifiable by its intensely bright white lights, is initially moving on the ground from right to center. It then takes off and continues flying toward the top left. Near the runway or taxiway, there are white silhouettes of other large passenger airplanes. The moving plane passes by these stationary aircraft. In the surrounding area, the faint silhouettes of other airplanes are visible on the ground, amidst numerous out-of-focus lights from the airport.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A monochromatic, nighttime view captures an airport scene. Numerous bright, blurry lights dot the dark landscape, indicating runways, taxiways, and distant city lights on the horizon. One airplane is in motion, initially moving on the ground from the right to the center, then taking off and flying towards the top left. Near the runway or taxiway, silhouettes of other large passenger airplanes are visible. The moving plane passes by these stationary aircraft, with its bright landing lights illuminated, as it flies across the frame. Additionally, there are several stationary passenger planes on the ground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the extreme wide shot, high angle, and the primary action of the airplane's takeoff. However, the spatial description could be more precise. The description of the stationary airplanes as silhouettes \"along the horizontal line\" is vague; it would be more informative to specify if they are docked at a terminal building or aligned along a specific taxiway, as this structure provides a key spatial anchor in the middle ground. The description of the taking-off plane's movement is also incomplete. While it correctly notes the diagonal ascent toward the top left, it omits the crucial detail that the plane is also moving away from the camera into the background, diminishing in size as it gains altitude. Furthermore, stating it \"passes over the other aircraft\" might be inaccurate; from the high angle, it more likely passes in front of the stationary planes on a runway positioned in the nearer part of the middle ground before it gains significant height. Clarifying these points would provide a more accurate and detailed account of the scene's spatial dynamics.",
