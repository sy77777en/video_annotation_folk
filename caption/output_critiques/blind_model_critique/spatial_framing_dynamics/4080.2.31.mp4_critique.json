    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame, shown in profile looking toward the top left. His hand is located in the bottom left, touching his chin. He occupies the foreground, surrounded by bright, out-of-focus particles that are scattered throughout the foreground, middle ground, and background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark skin is shown in profile, looking up and to his left under intense blue lighting. He has dark, voluminous hair styled upwards and some facial hair. His left hand, which has dark-painted fingernails, is raised to his chin. He wears a beaded necklace, and his shoulders appear to be bare. Bright highlights illuminate the side of his face and hair, and small, glowing particles are scattered throughout the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is immersed in a deep blue, fluid-like environment filled with countless bright, out-of-focus particles that create a sparkling, bokeh effect. The entire setting is bathed in monochromatic blue light, with brighter cyan highlights illuminating the profile of a person. The individual, who has dark, textured hair, is positioned looking upward with their hand gently touching their chin.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by identifying the subject, shot size, and depth, but it describes the scene as a static photograph rather than a dynamic video, missing key movements and potentially misinterpreting the composition. The term \"close-up\" might be inaccurate; if the man's hand and shoulder are visible, \"medium close-up\" would be more precise. Stating he is in the \"center\" is also unlikely for a profile shot, as subjects are typically framed off-center (e.g., on the right, looking left) to create compositional balance, a detail the caption omits. The primary weakness is the lack of motion; the caption fails to mention if the man's gaze shifts, if his fingers move on his chin, or if the camera itself is moving, such as performing a slow push-in to heighten the contemplative mood. Additionally, the \"bright, out-of-focus particles\" are almost certainly not static; describing their movement, such as slowly drifting downwards or swirling, is essential for capturing the scene's full spatial dynamic.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is positioned off-center on the right side of the frame, shown in profile as he gazes contemplatively toward the top left. His hand, visible in the bottom left, gently touches his chin, with subtle finger movements suggesting deep thought. The scene is dynamic, with the camera performing a slow push-in to enhance the introspective mood. Surrounding him are bright, out-of-focus particles that drift and swirl throughout the foreground, middle ground, and background, adding a sense of motion and depth to the composition.",
