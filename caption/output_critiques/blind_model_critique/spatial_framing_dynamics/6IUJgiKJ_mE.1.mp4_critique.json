    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a lead cyclist is initially positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, with a group of following cyclists and support vehicles trailing behind him in the center-right middle ground. The road extends from the bottom of the frame into the background, bordered by trees and houses in the middle ground and a large hill in the distant background on the right. As the video progresses, the camera pans left, tracking the subjects as they move from right to left and closer to the camera's position. The lead cyclist travels from the center middle ground to the bottom-left foreground, increasing in size within the frame. Consequently, the trailing group of cyclists and vehicles shifts to occupy the center and center-right of the frame, while the background scenery and spectators on the left side scroll across the screen. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, the lead cyclist, rides a black road bike in the center of a paved road. He wears a light blue short-sleeved jersey, black cycling shorts, a white helmet, and sunglasses. Following him are three other male cyclists, all wearing helmets; one wears a red jersey, another wears a yellow and black jersey, and the color of the third cyclist's jersey is not specified. Accompanying the cyclists is a black motorcycle carrying both a driver and a passenger, both wearing dark helmets and jackets, equipped with professional filming equipment. Further back, another motorcycle is operated by a person in a dark uniform and a white helmet. In the midground, three vehicles travel in a line: the first two are black, with the second carrying a large black device likely for filming, and the third vehicle is yellow. Numerous cars and pedestrians are positioned along the roadside.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A group of cyclists rides along a wide asphalt highway on a sunny day, marked with clear white, yellow, and red lines. The road is lined with lush green trees and sidewalks, with houses partially visible in the background. In the distance, a large, dry, tree-dotted hill rises against the sky. The cyclists are followed by several support vehicles, including motorcycles and a car with a bike rack on its roof. Numerous vehicles and pedestrians are parked along the road as the procession moves through the residential area.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the general camera pan and the subjects' movement from the middle ground to the foreground, but it could be more precise about the initial composition and the dynamic transitions. The lead cyclist is described as being in the \"center,\" but in the video, he is positioned more on the center-right, creating a leading space on the left that anticipates his movement across the frame. The description of the trailing group as \"center-right\" is correct, but it fails to mention that the support vehicles are distinctly behind the cyclists, creating another layer of depth within the middle ground. A key element missed is the spectators, who are mentioned only during the pan; they are visible from the start, lining the left side of the road in the middle ground. Furthermore, the description of the trailing group's movement is too static; instead of just \"shifting to occupy the center,\" the group follows the same path as the leader, moving from the center-right middle ground into the center foreground and beginning their own exit from the frame by the video's end. Finally, stating the lead cyclist \"disappears\" is abrupt; a more accurate description would be that he passes the camera and exits the frame at the bottom-left, briefly becoming a medium shot as he does so.",
