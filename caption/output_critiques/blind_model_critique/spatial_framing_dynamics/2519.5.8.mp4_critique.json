    "pre_caption": "This is a high-angle, close-up shot of a map. The aged map of Scotland fills the entire frame in the background. In the foreground, a magnifying glass is positioned in the bottom right quadrant, with its lens centered over the map. A small ink drop is visible on the map in the top left, while a prominent shadow is cast across the top right of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A yellowed, aged paper map of a coastal region in Scotland is laid out, showing cities like Glasgow and Kilmarnock, and islands such as Arran and Kintyre, with roads and land features detailed. A small ink drop is visible on the map near the Kintyre peninsula. A classic magnifying glass with a round lens is positioned over the map, enlarging the area centered on Kilmarnock. The scene is cast in warm light, creating a distinct shadow that falls across the upper right portion of the map.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An aged, yellowed map of a coastal region of Scotland lies on a flat surface. A round magnifying glass with a dark rim is placed over the map, enlarging the area around Kilmarnock and revealing details of nearby towns and roads. The map itself shows signs of use, with a small, dark ink drop near the Kintyre peninsula. Warm, directional lighting from the right casts distinct, dark shadows over both the upper right and bottom right corners of the map, which includes the city of Glasgow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the high-angle shot and the primary elements, but it incorrectly portrays the scene as static, which misses the central action of the video. The description fails to mention the hand that holds the magnifying glass in the foreground, a key element that is visible throughout. Furthermore, the caption states the magnifying glass is \"positioned in the bottom right,\" but in the video, it is in motion, starting in the bottom right and moving slowly and deliberately toward the center of the frame, passing over the southern regions of the map. This movement is the main dynamic of the shot, and its omission is a significant error. The description of the shadows is also incomplete, as it doesn't mention that they move in tandem with the hand and magnifying glass, which is a direct consequence of the primary action. An improved caption would need to describe the movement of the hand and magnifying glass from their starting point to their path across the map, thereby providing a more accurate account of the spatial changes occurring in the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a high-angle, close-up shot of an aged map of Scotland filling the entire frame. In the foreground, a hand holds a magnifying glass, initially positioned in the bottom right quadrant. The magnifying glass moves slowly and deliberately toward the center of the frame, passing over the southern regions of the map. A small ink drop is visible on the map in the top left. As the hand and magnifying glass move, they cast a prominent shadow that shifts across the top right of the frame, adding dynamic motion to the scene.",
