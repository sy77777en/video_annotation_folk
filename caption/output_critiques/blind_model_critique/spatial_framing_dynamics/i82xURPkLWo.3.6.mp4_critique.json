    "pre_caption": "This medium close-up shot frames a man in the center foreground. Behind him, a rustic wooden wall with a window occupies the background, creating depth with a view of a green, natural setting outside. The camera is positioned at the man's level, and the framing remains static throughout the clip as he stays in a fixed central position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a darker skin tone, a buzz cut hairstyle, and a neatly trimmed goatee. He is wearing a brown t-shirt and is seated, facing slightly to his left. His expression changes as he speaks, transitioning from a subtle smile to a more contemplative look, while he appears to be looking slightly downward. The setting suggests a relaxed, informal environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a rustic, weathered wooden structure in the background, featuring vertical planks and a few windows. The environment suggests a cozy, countryside interior, with natural light streaming in to indicate daytime. The scene includes a person seated, wearing a brown shirt, with a relaxed demeanor. The texture of the wooden structure is rough, with visible grain and signs of aging. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with muted colors and a focus on the simplicity of the surroundings.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is the feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is excellent and serves as a model example of how to follow the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot size as a \"medium close-up\" and precisely places the man in the \"center foreground.\" The description of the background elements, their position, and the sense of depth created by the window view is also accurate and well-observed.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete and addresses all the required components of the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as \"medium close-up.\"\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It clearly defines the man's position (\"center foreground\") and the background elements' position (\"background\").\n*   **Depth:** It explicitly mentions how depth is created (\"creating depth with a view of a green, natural setting outside\").\n*   **Camera Height:** It specifies the camera is \"at the man's level.\"\n*   **Dynamics:** It effectively describes the lack of movement, stating that the \"framing remains static\" and the man \"stays in a fixed central position.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption perfectly adheres to all stylistic and structural guidelines:\n*   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n*   It uses simple, natural English.\n*   It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"rustic\" is a descriptive term for a style and is acceptable here), speculation, and ambiguity.\n*   It follows the logical flow requested: shot size, then spatial positioning of elements, followed by camera height and dynamics.\n*   It returns only the description without any introductory text or markdown.",
