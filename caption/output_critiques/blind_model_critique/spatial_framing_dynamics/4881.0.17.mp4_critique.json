    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman in a green top is positioned in the center-right of the frame, with a man in a blue cardigan to her left, both situated in the middle ground. A table with a decanter occupies the foreground, while several other people are seated in the background. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, slowly zooms in, tightening the focus on the woman who remains centrally framed. As the shot progresses, the man on the left is pushed to the edge of the frame, with only his shoulder remaining visible, while the background figures become less prominent.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, dark, wavy hair and tan skin is the central focus, sitting at a table and looking directly forward with a serious expression. She wears a pleated, long-sleeved green top with a tie-front, a silver-colored necklace, and rings, and is rubbing her hands together. To her right, the left of the frame, sits a man with short, dark, curly hair and a beard, wearing a light blue fuzzy cardigan over a white t-shirt and a gold chain. In the background, several other women are seated. One, behind the man and in the center of the frame, has long dark hair and glasses and is looking down at something in her hands, with smoke rising nearby. Another woman with long, light brown hair sits behind the main subject to the right, looking away. A fifth person, a man wearing a light-colored head covering and sunglasses, is partially visible in the far background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene is set in a dimly lit room with dark blue walls. A group of people is gathered around a low table, seated on a large red and gold patterned cushion. A pink pillow rests on the cushion. On the table, a crystal decanter is visible. In the background, a two-tiered white side table holds a lamp and other small items, while a shelf is mounted on the back wall. Wisps of smoke are present in the air.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and the camera's movement, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and their consequences. The description of the man's position as \"to her right, on the left side of the frame\" is confusing; it's clearer to state he is on the left of the frame and she is on the right. A key omission is the change in shot size; as the camera moves forward, the shot transitions from a medium shot to a medium close-up on the woman, which is a significant spatial change. The description could also be improved by mentioning the depth of field, as the foreground decanter and background people are likely soft-focused to isolate the main subjects. Finally, while the caption notes the man is pushed to the edge, it could more explicitly link this to the camera's clockwise arc, clarifying that as the camera orbits right, it naturally crops out the left side of the initial composition, causing the background to shift behind the woman.",
