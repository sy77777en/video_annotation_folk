    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of a rural landscape at dusk, framed from a slightly elevated perspective. In the foreground, a dark wall or fence runs along the bottom of the frame. The middle ground is occupied by the dark silhouettes of several trees: a tall evergreen is positioned on the left, a large deciduous tree is in the center, and another evergreen and tree cluster are on the right. In the background, the twilight sky fills the majority of the frame. A soft orange glow is visible on the horizon behind the trees, while dark clouds dominate the upper and left portions of the sky. Two bright orange contrails are visible in the top center of the frame. The camera remains completely still throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot depicting a dramatic twilight sky over a rural setting. The focus is on the atmospheric quality of the environment rather than a specific subject, using the vastness of the sky to create a sense of scale and mood. The scene is dominated by a deep blue-grey sky filled with dark, heavy clouds. Near the horizon, the last light of the setting sun casts a soft orange and pink glow. Two long, thin contrails, brightly illuminated by the sun, streak across the upper portion of the sky in a vibrant orange hue. In the middle ground, the dark silhouettes of several trees, including tall evergreens and a large, leafy deciduous tree, stand in stark contrast against the colorful twilight.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an outdoor perspective, the scene captures a rural or suburban landscape at dusk. The sky transitions from a dark, cloudy blue to a soft orange glow at the horizon. Two long, thin contrails, illuminated by the setting sun, streak across the upper sky with a bright orange hue. In the middleground, several trees, including a large deciduous tree and a couple of conical evergreens, are silhouetted against the twilight sky. A dark fence or wall runs along the bottom of the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as a static wide shot and accurately describes the content. The placement of all elements—the foreground wall/fence at the bottom, the specific trees in the middle ground (left, center, right), and the background sky with its glow, clouds, and contrails—is described with precise 2D and 3D spatial terms.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete and fulfills all requirements of the prompt. It establishes the shot size, camera height (\"slightly elevated perspective\"), and the static nature of the camera. It systematically breaks down the scene into foreground, middle ground, and background, and for each layer, it details the 2D position of the key elements within the frame.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to the instructions.\n*   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that flows logically from the overall shot type to the specific details layered by depth.\n*   **Content:** It focuses strictly on spatial framing and dynamics, successfully describing shot size, position (2D and 3D), and height.\n*   **Language:** It uses simple, natural, and objective English. It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"soft\" and \"bright\" are used as objective descriptors of light intensity, which is acceptable) and speculative phrases. The description of the object as a \"wall or fence\" is a reasonable way to handle a visually ambiguous element without violating the rule against speculation.\n*   **Formatting:** It is returned as a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions, providing a description that is accurate, thorough, and perfectly aligned with the required focus on spatial composition.",
