    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot from a low, level angle, positioned on a medical stretcher. An injured man lies in the foreground, his body extending from the bottom of the frame towards the center. Directly behind him in the middle ground, a person in a pigeon costume is centered, holding the stretcher. The road stretches from the foreground into the background, flanked by rocky cliffs on the left and right in the middle ground, with a graffiti-covered gate also on the left. As the stretcher moves forward, the pigeon person leans in, transitioning their framing from a full shot to a medium shot, while the man in the foreground remains in a consistent position relative to the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with dark hair and a beard lies on his back on a metal medical stretcher. He is wearing a light-colored hospital gown composed of rows of regularly spaced dots and dashes, sunglasses, a white neck brace, a bandage wrapped around his forehead, and a white cast on his right arm and hand. Pushing the stretcher from behind is a person in a full-body, plush grey pigeon costume. The costume features a large, sculpted bird head with an orange beak and large, round orange eyes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds on a paved road winding through a sun-drenched, rocky landscape. The level angle captures steep, light-colored cliffs with sparse green vegetation rising on both sides of the road, and a bright sun creates a strong lens flare in the sky. On the left, a tall metal gate covered in colorful graffiti stands beside the road. A figure in a large bird costume pushes the stretcher from behind, with the legs and torso of an injured person in a hospital gown visible in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively identifies the main subjects and their initial positions, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics. The statement that the injured man \"shifts to the lower left\" is confusing; since the camera is mounted on the stretcher he is on, his position in the frame should remain fixed unless he physically moves. It is more likely that the pigeon person's movement *reframes the composition*, making the man's static position feel more confined to that corner. A better description would be, \"As the pigeon person leans forward, their upper body fills the center frame, compositionally pushing the man's form into the lower left.\" Furthermore, the caption misses a key dynamic: as the stretcher \"moves forward,\" the background elements like the rocky cliffs and the graffiti-covered gate would appear to slide past and recede. Describing this parallax effect would significantly improve the analysis of the scene's spatial changes. Finally, clarifying the camera's exact position on the stretcher—for instance, \"mounted at the foot of the stretcher, looking up\"—would provide a clearer initial orientation for the viewer.",
